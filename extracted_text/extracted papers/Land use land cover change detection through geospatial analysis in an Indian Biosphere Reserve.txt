Title: Trees, Forests and People

Abstract: The present study examines the land use land cover (LULC) and change detection impacts on forest ecosystem in Achanakmaar Amarkantak Biosphere Reserve (AABR -area 626.76 km 2 ) of Central India. Results revealed that there has been a change in AABR land use pattern from 2008 to 2018. The major changes include loss of 19.72 km 2 of vegetation cover in various forest types due to increasing biotic interference and over grazing, conversion of 14.77 km 2 of Dense Sal mixed forest to open mixed forest and cultivable land, and 5.0 km 2 teak plantation and Bamboo brakes to agricultural land. Despite losing many plant species due to anthropogenic pressure, the present study found that the AABR as a unique repository of plant species rich in biodiversity. Many spots of this area are invaded or replaced by exotic species which is causing the loss of ecology and diversity of this region. Based on our study Sal mixed forest reduced by 2.88% (5.23 km 2 ), Dense mixed forest 4.02% (9.54 km 2 ), Teak plantation 6.77% (2.61 km 2 ) and Bamboo brakes reduced by 7.66% (2.34 km 2 ). The study concludes that the Landsat 7 TM and Resourcesat 2A satellite images are the most suitable for studying the LULC change on forest ecosystem of AABR. We advocate that by adopting the rigorous conservation measures, especially in open & dense forest and young under-stocked teak forests can restore the vegetation density and diversity in the area. Moreover, Sal natural regeneration of vegetation would remain crucial, and invasion of exotic species over native species needs to be restored in the forest area. Such findings on major changes occurring in forest ecosystem hold tremendous implications in relation to the welfare of the resource-poor tribal communities who are greatly dependent on the natural resources available in AABR for their livelihood.
