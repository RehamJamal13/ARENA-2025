Title: Predicting the Future Land Use and Land Cover Changes for Bhavani Basin, Tamil Nadu, India Using QGIS MOLUSCE Plugin

Abstract: Human population growth, movement, and 9 demand have a substantial impact on land use 10 and land cover dynamics. Thematic maps of land 11 use and land cover (LULC) serve as a reference 12 for scrutinizing, source administration, and 13 forecasting, making it easier to establish plans 14 that balance preservation, competing uses, and 15 growth compressions. The objective of this study 16 is to identify the changeover of land-use changes 17 in the Bhavani basin for the two periods 2005 18 and 2015, as well as to forecast and establish 19 potential land-use changes in the year 2025 and 20 2030 by using QGIS 2.18.24 version MOLUSCE
