ABSTRACT:
This study explores the influence of land-use and land cover (LULC) changes on the temperature over North India (NI) and North-Eastern India (NEI) during 1981-2006 by subtracting the reanalysis temperature from the observed temperature (observation minus reanalysis (OMR) method). The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data of the AVHRR satellite for the period 1981-2006 were analyzed to understand the type of LULC changes during this period and their linkage with the temperature change over the two regions. The results from OMR indicated that the LULC change over NI during 1981-2006 resulted a warming of 0.03 ‚Ä¢ C, and that of NEI during this period resulted a cooling of 1.5 ‚Ä¢ C.
The results from LULC changes during the said period indicated an increase of dry land/snow cover and agriculture/fallow land by ~0.1% of total area and a decrease of shrubs/small vegetation and dense forest over NI by about 0.1-0.2%. Over NEI, the areas under agricultural/fallow land, open forest and dense forest showed an increase by about 0.8-2.4% during this period, and the areas under dry/snow cover and shrubs/small vegetation indicated a decrease by ~0.7-3.6%. The comparison between the OMR analysis and LULC changes indicated that the warming over NI during 1981-2006 is due to the expansion of the dry land and the decline of dense forest. On the other hand, the cooling over NEI during the period is attributed to the decline of non-vegetated/small vegetated lands and the expansion of agricultural land/forest covers in that period. This study has an overall implication towards the modeling studies for the impact assessment of LULC changes in the present as well as future climate.

## Introduction ##
Recent studies have revealed that anthropogenic forcing due to the changes in land-use and land cover (LULC) is one of the responsible factors for the temperature change in recent decades 
Northern India (NI), located in the north part of India, comprising the states of Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Haryana, Punjab, Chandigarh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, and the union territories of Delhi. North-Eastern India (NEI), located at the easternmost part of India, consists of eight states viz. Sikkim, Assam, Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, and Nagaland. A location map of the two regions viz. NI and NEI are depicted in Figure

Similarly, LULC changes over Eastern India contributed towards warming at a rate of ~2 ¬∞C per decade during 1991-2006 due to conversion of small vegetation into bare lands, while it resulted in cooling during 1981-1990 due to an increase of dense forests and agricultural lands

## Materials and Methods ##
The reanalysis daily temperature datasets were obtained from the NCER/NCAR Reanalysis (NNRP1) over NI and NEI regions, and the observed daily temperature was taken from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) at 16 different stations for the period 1981-2006. The geographical locations of each station are given in Table 
where T s is the reanalysis temperature at the station, d i -1 is the Euclidean distance from the station to the corner point g i , Tg i is the reanalysis temperature at point g i . The temperature trends over the regions are then estimated from the linear trends in the reanalysis and observed temperature anomalies during 1981-2006 with respect to their 26 years means. Finally, we subtracted the reanalysis temperature trend from the observed temperature trend to calculate the contribution of LULC changes towards the temperature over the regions. This method of estimating the impact of LULC changes on the temperature is known as the observation minus reanalysis (OMR) method 
The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images from AVHRR products are classified into different LULC types at 8 km resolution for the years 1981, 1991, and 2006 by using the hierarchy approach of LULC types 
N IR -Red N IR + Red The hierarchy approach refers to categorizing the whole LULC into two groups based on the NDVI values and then to categorize each individual into another two groups and to continue the process

In this section, we investigated the conversion of each LULC type from one type to another over NI and NEI during 1981-2006 (Figure 

## Discussion ##
In this study, we explored the impact of LULC changes on the temperature over NI and NEI during 1981-2006 by subtracting the reanalysis temperature from the observed temperature (observation minus reanalysis (OMR) method). We found that the LULC change during 1981-2006 resulted warming of 0.034 ‚Ä¢ C over NI, while it caused cooling of 1.5 ‚Ä¢ C over NEI during this period. Our results over NI were found to be qualitatively comparable with the previous studies conducted over other regions of India 
We further attempted to investigate the changes in LULC over NI and NEI during 1981-2006 from the AVHRR satellite datasets to understand the type of LULC changes and their linkage with the temperature change over these two regions. Analysis indicated that the warming over NI during 1981-2006 could be due to expansion of the areas under dry land/snow cover and reduction of areas under dense forest during this period. The cooling over NEI during 1981-2006 could be due to the decline of non-vegetated/small vegetated lands and the expansion of agricultural land/forest covers in that period. It is noticed that the dry land/snow cover and shrubs/small vegetation are largely decreased over NEI during 1981-2006. The reason for the decreased areas under these categories over NEI could be attributed to the snowmelt 

## Conclusions ##
This study explored the influences of LULC changes on the temperature trend during 1981-2006 over two regions (NI and NEI) of India. The reanalysis temperature over each region was subtracted from the observed temperature over the corresponding region. The so-called "observation minus reanalysis" (OMR) method was used to quantify the impact of LULC changes on the temperature over both regions. The results indicated that due to the LULC changes during 1981-2006, NI experienced a warming of 0.034 ‚Ä¢ C, while NEI experienced cooling of 1.5 ‚Ä¢ C during this period. AVHRR satellite images were deployed to recognize the LULC changes occurring during this period over NI and NEI and to understand their linkage with the surface temperature change. Overall analysis inferred an expansion of the areas under dry land/snow cover over NI during 1981-2006 and a reduction of areas under dense forest over the same region in that period. This may lead to warming over NI during 1981-2006. On the other hand, a decline of non-vegetated/small vegetated lands is noticed over NEI during this 1981-2006 and an expansion of agricultural land/forest covers is seen over the same region in that period. This may lead to the cooling over NEI during
