ABSTRACT:
Extreme land-use and land-cover (LULC) as the result of rapid urbanization has been raising land surface temperature of core city areas and its surrounding. Therefore, investigation on surface temperature is very vital to analyze temperature variations and minimize its effect. This research aims to analyze the impacts of LULC changes on LST in Bangui city, Central African Republic using combined techniques of remote sensing and GIS. The result of this study indicates that there was a significant change in LULC between 1986 and 2017 particularly expanded in vegetation and built-up areas and declined in bare soil. For instance, built-up increased by + 130.29 % with a rate of 137.06; and vegetation increased by 8.44% or a rate of 17.2. Whereas bare soil was sharply declined by -35.33% for a rate of -155.83. The mean LST of the city firstly decreased from 26.24 °C in 1986 to 23.37 °C  in 1999 and increased to 27.23 °C in 2017.  The study also stated that the mean LST of built-up areas increased from 26.21 °C in 1986 to 27.59 °C in 2017. Besides, the mean LST of bare soil raised from 26.51 °C to 27.33 °C in 1986 and 2017 respectively. These indicate that built up and bare soil experienced high LST than vegetation and water body. The study found a positive correlation between NDBI and LST whereas negative correlations of LST with NDVI and NDLI. City planners should be implemented urban green belts and green roof to mitigate the effect of surface urban heat islands (SUHI) in the city and its surooundings.

## Introduction ##
Currently, many regions around the globe under different environmental conditions are facing dramatic changes in LULC 
Over time, land-use change maps provide essential information for land-use planning 
Though several studies have been done in different regions of the world, yet the problem of urban climate change mainly SUHI effects is the burning issue of world cities. This initiate to conduct the study and to provide information for city planners about LULC change and its impact on LST. The study has the objective to examine the impacts of LULC changes on LST in Bangui city from 1986 to 2017 using Landsat images. Therefore, the study is very essential for city planners, municipality experts, as well as other higher officials since the results of the study provide significant information about the trend of LULC change and its impact on LST and enable to impliment SUHI mitigation measures.

## Material and methods ##


## Study area ##
Geographically, Bangui city is located in between 4°18 ′ 9" N to 4°29 ′ 28" N and 18°29 ′ 25" E to 18°39 ′ 8" E ( Fig. 

## Data collection and preprocessing ##
This study analyzes the impact of LULC change on LST in Bangui city from 1986 to 2017. Different Landsat Products (Landsat 5 (Thematic Mapper (TM)) and Landsat 8 (Operational Land Imager (OLI)) were collected on the temporal resolution of 16 days and spatial resolution of 30 m for the period of 1986, 1999 and 2017 ( Table 

## Conversion of digital number into radiance ##
The Landsat images were downloaded as raw data (digital numbers) which needs to be converted to spectral radiances (L 𝜆) by using the information in the Landsat metadata header file 
Where: 𝐿 𝜆 is the spectral radiance (Wm -2 sr -1 μm -1) , LMAX 𝜆 is the spectral radiance scaled to Q Calmax (W m -2 sr -1 𝜇m -1 ). LMIN 𝜆 is the spectral radiance scaled to Q Calmin (W m -2 sr -1 𝜇m -1 ). Q Calmax is the maximum quantized calibrated pixel value (DN = 255) that corresponds to LMAX 𝜆 . The minimum quantized calibrated pixel value (DN = 0) corresponds to LMIN 𝜆 . Q Cal is the quantized calibrated pixel value (DN).

## Conversion from radiance to reflectance ##
The radiances calculated using Eq. ( 
Where: 𝑟 is the planetary reflectance (dimensionless), L 𝜆 is the spectral radiance at the sensor aperture (W m -2 sr -1 𝜇m -1 ), dr = 1 + 0.033cos ( D × 2 × 3.14)/365), where D is the day of the year, E sun is the mean solar atmospheric irradiance (W m -2 𝜇m -1 ), 𝜃 is the solar zenith angle (degree), 𝜃 = (90 -B), and B is the Sun elevation angle. dr is the inverse square of the earth-sun distance (astronomical unit).

## Retrieval Land Surface Temperature (LST) ##
In this study, LST was derived from thermal bands of Landsat products using the methodology recommended by 
Where: K1 and K2 are the conversions constant, L 𝜆 is a spectral radiance and T is brightness temperature. For Landsat 8 OLI, K1 = 774.8853 Kelvin and K2 = 1321.0789 Kelvin; for Landsat 7 ETM + , K1 = 666.09 Kelvin and K2 = 1282.71 Kelvin; and Landsat 5 TM, K1 = 607.76 Kelvin and K2 = 1260.56 Kelvin.
In the second step, LST was derived using the following relation 
Where: 𝜆 ( ≈ 11.5 μm) is the effective wavelength of thermal bands. P = h 𝑐 𝜎 = 1.438 × 10 2 mK, where ' 𝜎' is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10-23 JK-1), h is Planck constant (6.626 × 10-34 Js) and c is the speed of light (3.0 × 108 ms -1 ), 𝜖 is the land surface emissivity with 0.95, 0.92 and 0.9925 for vegetation, build-up and water surfaces, respectively 
Where: 𝑑 𝜀 = geometrical distribution of the surface; 𝜀 𝑣 = vegetation emissivity; Ɛ s = the soil emissivity; F = shape factor and its value is 0.55; P v = vegetation proportion and it was obtained according to Eq. 6 (   Then land surface emissivity was retrieved using equation 7.

## Calculation of spectral indices ##
The NDVI is widely used as the vegetation indicator by combining the reflectance of two-channels which sensitive to vegetation feature, including red band (RED) and near-infrared band (NIR). The NDVI ranges from -1 to + 1. The NDVI is expressed in the following equation 
Where: 𝜌 Mir and 𝜌 Nir correspond to the reflectance of Middle-infrared and Near-infrared bands of Landsat images, respectively. The NDLI has been proven as an effective indicator in assessing the potential evapotranspiration of the surface. The advantage of the NDLI is its uniqueness in optimizing the spectral sensitivity on biophysical land surface parameters by incorporating three commonly channels chosen by the satellite missions, including Green, Red, and Shortwave-infrared. The NDLI is estimated by the equation below.

## 𝑁𝐷 𝐿𝐼 = ##
𝜌 𝐺 𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑛 -𝜌 Re 𝑑 𝜌 𝐺 𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑛 + 𝜌 Re 𝑑 + 𝜌 𝑀𝑖𝑟 

## Preparation of land use land-cover classes ##
After radiance was converted to reflectance in Eq. 2 , LULC classes were extracted for the period 1986, 1999 and 2017 by applying maxi-mum likelihood supervised classification. Supervised classification was used to classify the pixels into different land use classes 

## Statistical analysis ##
The study used Correlation coefficient (R) to assess the relationship between LST and NDVI, NDBI and NDLI of the study area of each year. The study was used three indices namely NDVI, NDBI and NDLI to characterize the surface and LST variations in Bangui city. These indices were used to establish quantifiable relationships with LST through the set of independent pixels chosen randomly within the entire study area. The statistical relationship was implemented using the Excel 2016 software package.

## Results and discussion ##


## Land-use/land-cover change from 1986 to 2017 ##
Built up, vegetation, bare soil/ rock and water were the main LULC types found in Bangui city. The spatiotemporal distribution of LULC classes of the city in 1986, 1999 and 2017 are illustrated in Fig. 

## Spatiotemporal distribution of LST and its variations with LULC types ##
Fig. 
The study confirmed that central areas of the city were exhibited high LST and it declined when moving away from the center. This is because of buildings and other impervious surface expansion 

## Relationship of LST with NDVI, NDBI and NDLI ##
The study revealed that most places in the center of the city exhibited low NDVI values while peripheral areas and places covered with vegetation have high NDVI values ( Fig. 
The result of this study shows that there is a negative correlation between LST and NDVI ( r = -0.9191, -0.8117, and -0.7549 for 1986, 1999, and 2017, respectively) ( Fig. 

## Conclusions ##
Land-cover types has been degraded from time to time and this degradation cause change in urban climate. Continuous and extreme land and environmental degradation, particularly affect LST in many cities in the world. So, monitoring LULC is very vital to understand trend of LST. In this regards, advanced remote sensing technology has been used for environmental resource monitoring and planning. The result of the study indicates that built-up areas were expanded from 1986 to 2017 whereas bare soil declined. Besides, the area of vegetation cover was somewhat increased from 1986 to 2017 due to the expansion of green space in the city. Though green areas were expanded in the city, the LST increasing from 1986 to 2017. The study revealed that the minimum, maximum and mean LST of the city increased during the study period. The study also stated that built-up and bare soil experienced higher LST than vegetation and water body. This study indicates that significant variations of LST related to the transformation of LULC in Bangui city originating from the urbanization process. The study found a positive correlation between NDBI and LST whereas negative correlations between LST and NDVI and NDLI. Therefore, to mitigate the impact of LULC change on LST the city planner and administrator should work on different landscape planning on ecological and biodiversity perspectives. The landscape planning of the city should also focus on the techniques of regulating the effects of SUHI. The city administra-tor should also work to increase urban green belts and green roof mechanisms.
