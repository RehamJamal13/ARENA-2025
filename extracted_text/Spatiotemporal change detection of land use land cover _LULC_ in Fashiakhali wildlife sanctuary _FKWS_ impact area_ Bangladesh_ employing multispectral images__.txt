ABSTRACT:
Land cover change has posed significant concerns to biodiversity and climate change in Bangladesh and globally. Despite the country's designation of forest regions as protected areas to conserve their valuable resources, deforestation and forest conversion remained unabated. Fashiakhali Wildlife Sanctuary (FKWS), a protected area in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, and its surrounding forested impact area have experienced considerable changes over the years, yet are deficient in extensive assessment. This study evaluated the land use land cover (LULC) changes in the FKWS impact area over almost 3 decades  using multispectral remotely sensed data. The Landsat images of 1994, 2001, 2010, and 2021  were classified using a maximum likelihood algorithm and analyzed for change detection. The comparative potential of vegetation indices, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), in forest cover assessment, and the relationship between Land Surface Temperature (LST) and NDVI was also assessed. A significant forest cover loss of around 1117.17 ha (16%) was recorded in the FKWS impact area between 1994 and 2021, with the hugest proportion of 867.78 ha (12.24%) deforested in the first period (1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001). Agricultural land also declined by 593.73 ha (8.37%) within the entire period, despite its initial increase of 392.04 ha (5.53%) between 2001 and 2010, being the primary driver of earlier deforestation. However, in the recent decade (2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015)(2016)(2017)(2018)(2019)(2020)(2021), settlement expansion of 963.90 ha (13.59%) due to massive human migration in the area contributed to the most remarkable overall land cover change of 1731.51 ha (24.42%). Furthermore, NDVI provided a better and more accurate forest cover assessment than SAVI and was recommended to aid in the quick evaluation and monitoring of the future impacts of agriculture, settlement, and other sorts of land use on the forest cover. In tandem with the widely acknowledged issue of increased temperature due to climate change, an absolute negative correlation was found between the NDVI and LST, confirming the negative impact of climate change on forest loss in the FKWS impact area.

## Introduction ##
The alarming rate of deforestation and its repercussions have raised concerns on a global scale 
Bangladesh is a small developing nation with a vast population size that was around 147 million as of mid-2007 and is predicted to be 222 million by 2050 
The Fashiakhali Wildlife Sanctuary (FKWS), located within Fashiakhali Forest Reserve, is a protected area in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh and was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 2007 
The land cover describes the physical and environmental characteristics of the land surface area, including the presence of water, crops, forests, constructions, etc. 
Remote sensing is a fundamental approach for studying spatial and temporal changes in LULC 
Moreover, until now, several studies have been conducted to detect changes in LULC of different Bangladesh's hill forests 

## Materials and methods ##


## Study area ##
Fashiakhali Wildlife Sanctuary (FKWS) is situated in Cox's Bazar District of Chittagong Division, located in the South-Eastern part of Bangladesh. The FKWS is situated within Fashiakhali Forest Reserve (3068.7 ha) and lies between 21°45' to 21°40' N and 92°4' to 92°8' E 

## Satellite images and field data ##
Landsat images of respective sensor and satellite types for 

## Image pre-processing and classification ##
In this study, all the remote sensing analyses (i.e., image pre-processing, classification, change detection, vegetation indices, surface temperature mapping, and accuracy assessment) were performed in QGIS version 3.24.2 (Fig. 

## Change detection and accuracy assessment ##
The study employed pixel-by-pixel cross-tabulation analysis 
where TP is total pixels, and TCP is total corrected pixels.

## Vegetation indices ##
Several vegetation indices can be employed to detect and analyze the existence and extent of vegetation and forest cover. Among the commonest ones are NDVI and SAVI 
(1) 

## Land surface temperature (LST) ##
LST is an essential parameter that measures the emission of thermal radiance (temperature) from the land surface or, in vegetated areas, the canopy surface 
ETM + thermal band 6 (10.4-12.5 μm), and OLI thermal band 10 (10.6-11.19 μm) were used. The first stage involved converting the thermal band digital number (DN) values for each Landsat image, according to the respective sensor types, to sensor spectral radiance using the following formula (Eq. 4) 
where, L max λ = Maximum spectral radiance scaled The following equation (Eq. 5) is then used to convert spectral radiance to temperature in Kelvin 
where

## Relationship between NDVI and LST ##
The linear relationship between the NDVI and LST was computed using R (R Core 

## Results and discussion ##


## LULC patterns of FKWS impact area (1994-2021) ##
The LULC classification of the study area for the years 1994, 2001, 2010, and 2021 are shown in Fig. 

## Land cover change detection of FKWS impact area ##
The change detection analysis for each land cover category is mapped in Fig. 
The forest, water, and agriculture/grassland classes predominantly experienced negative changes, although agriculture/ grassland had recorded a considerable positive change within 2001-2010. On the other hand, the land areas considered bare land and settlement recorded a positive change over the years. The most significant transitions between 1994 and 2021 were found for forest and settlement, with a total of about 16% loss and 24% gain, respectively. Of these changes, the hugest forest change was recorded within the earliest seven (7) years evaluated 
In the recent decade, although the direct conversion of forest for agriculture in the protected area was no longer prominent, there has been continual cultivation of a large expanse of bare land. However, the rate decreased, with settlement expansion becoming the most prominent driver of forest cover loss (300.15 ha) (Table 

## Accuracy of classified images ##
An important step after land cover classification is accuracy evaluation, which defines the validity of the resultant map by assessing the errors for each class and generally for the whole classified image 

## Assessment of forest cover based on vegetation indices (NDVI and SAVI) ##
Remotely sensed vegetation indices are straightforward and efficient methods for quantitative and qualitative assessments of vegetation cover, vitality, and growth dynamics 

## Land surface temperature of FKWS impact area ##
Remotely sensed Land Surface Temperature (LST) has become one of the crucial indices to characterize and understand the thermal behavior of the earth cover in response to vegetation changes and associated climate processes 

## Conclusion ##
This study assessed the land use land cover changes in FKWS impact area in Bangladesh within nearly 3 decades  using remotely sensed multispectral imagery. The forest cover, predominantly accounting for almost 50% of the entire land area, drastically reduced over the years, especially within the first evaluation period
