Title: Land use and land cover change dynamics of Uzbekistan: a review

Abstract: Land use and land cover change (LULCC) is a dynamic process that shapes landscapes, ecosystems, and human societies. In the context of Uzbekistan, a country in Central Asia, LULCC has been driven by a complex interplay of socio-economic, political, and environmental factors. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the historical trajectories, drivers, and implications of LULCC in Uzbekistan. Through the synthesis of diverse data sources including remote sensing imagery, government reports, and peer-reviewed literature, we trace the evolution of land use patterns over time. Agricultural expansion and industrial development have reshaped land cover, impacting biodiversity and ecosystem services. We discuss the intricate web of drivers behind these changes, encompassing demographic shifts, policy alterations, and economic priorities. Moreover, we explore the socio-economic consequences of LULCC, addressing both opportunities and challenges posed by urbanization and agricultural intensification. The interactions between LULCC and climate patterns are examined, underlining the need for climate-conscious land use planning. Drawing on these insights, we emphasize the importance of sustainable land management and evidence-based policy formulation to mitigate negative impacts and maximize benefits. This review underscores the need for continued research, adaptive strategies, and collaborative efforts to address the complex and evolving dynamics of LULCC in Uzbekistan.
