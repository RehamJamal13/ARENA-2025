ABSTRACT:
Land-use change refers to a change in how a particular area of land is utilised or managed by humans. Land-cover change refers to a change in some continuous features of the land, such as vegetation type, soil conditions, and so on. For the purpose of identifying change-vulnerable areas and creating sustainable ecosystem services, mapping and quantifying the state of land use/land cover (LULC) changes and change-causing factors are crucial. The present research utilizes a geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) techniques to categorise and identify changes in a Murredu watershed in Telangana state, India, between 1996 and 2019. Five major LULC categories (agricultural land, forest, barren land, built-up area, and waterbodies) from satellite images of 1996 to 2019 were mapped. The maximum likelihood approach was used to supervise the classification process, and high-resolution Google Earth Pro was used to evaluate the accuracy of the classified map. The accuracy of the mapping was evaluated using the error matrix and Kappa statistics. Overall classification accuracy for the classified image of 2019 was found to be 90 % with overall kappa statistics of 85.98%. From these findings, change detection analysis shows that the area used for agricultural land, barren land, forest, built-up areas, and waterbodies has increased by 5.17%, 3.39%, 0.84%, and 0.26%, respectively, between 1996 and 2019. The forest area has decreased by 9.67% at the same time. Therefore, this research anticipates that the findings might provide information to planners, land managers, and decision-makers for the sustainable management and development of the natural resource.

## Introduction ##
The term ''land-use" describes how humans use the land cover to support themselves. It covered both the methods and motivations used to change the biophysical characteristics of the land. Crop cultivation, mining, housing, and infrastructure development are a few examples of land use 
The hydrological and geomorphological processes and features of a river system, as well as their interactions, variability, and spatial distribution, are described by river hydro-morphology 
Finding differences in a phenomenon's status by watching it at various periods is the method of ''change detection" 
Assessment of LULC change aids in determining the degree of human impact over the environment. Numerous academics believed it to be a significant process that has local, regional, and worldwide effects on both natural environments and socioeconomic conditions 
Due to its recurring data collecting, precise georeferencing processes, and digital format suited for computer processing, satellite remote sensing is the most popular data source for the quantification, identification, and mapping of LULC forms and variations 
There are several satellite programmes running right now. The Landsat programme is exceptional for change detection research because it offers a historical and ongoing archive of imagery 
In the watershed, biological circumstances, gradients, and elevations play a significant role in determining land use/land cover. In addition to the aforementioned variables, technological, socioeconomic, and institutional setup are also anticipated to have an impact on the LULC change 
In the present work, the changing pattern of LULC in the Murredu watershed from 1996 to 2019 has been mapped using multitemporal satellite images from Landsat-5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI/ TIRS imagery. The main objective of the current study was to utilise GIS and RS applications to find out the extent of changes occurring in the Murredu Watershed. However, the specific objectives were to: utilize SRTM-DEM to delineate the Murredu basin's watershed; and, furthermore, detect LULC changes in the Murredu watershed between 1996 and 2019.

## Study area ##
The current investigation was carried out in the Telangana state of India's Murredu watershed (Fig. 

## Data acquisition ##
The SRTM-DEM data, collected and was utilized to generate watershed boundary of the Murredu basin. For the purpose of visual image interpretation and identifying LULC change, satellite data comprised of multi-spectral data collected by the Landsat satellite and made available by the USGS Earth Explorer (https:// earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) were utilised (Table 
The Landsat-8 image acquired in 2019 is part of the utilised satellite dataset. Launched on 2013, the Landsat-8 satellite sensor has two sensors: a thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) and an operational land imager (OLI). Landsat-8 satellite information consist of eleven bands with a spatial resolution of 30 m for bands 1 through 9. For bands 10 as well as 11, the spatial resolution is 100 m. In the panchromatic band (band 8), which has a spatial resolution of 15 m. Bands 1 to 7 coastal, blue, green, red, nearinfrared, shortwave infrared I, and shortwave infrared II were chosen for examination in this study since bands 8 to 11 are less frequently employed in LULC classification (https://www. usgs.gov/media/images/landsat-8-band-designations).
On the other hand, the satellite dataset used includes the 1996 Landsat-5 image. Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) level 1 records were acquired in 1996; the mission was launched on 1984. Each of the seven bands of the Landsat-5 satellite data has a spatial resolution of 30 m. Thermal band 6 has a 120 m spatial resolution. Visible (bands 1 to 3), near-infrared, and mid-infrared are included (https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-5). It was difficult to choose images from the same date across the entire study period. Additionally, LULC class ground truth data were used. This information was gathered as reference data points for 2019 image analysis utilising the Google Earth Pro, and it was utilised to classify images and evaluate the classification results' overall accuracy.

## Data preparation for watershed delineation ##
The highest sensitivity zones may be extrapolated using DEMs, which are based on watershed realisation utilising the computational watershed application of Spatial Analyst tools 

## Methodology ##
Fig. 

## Pre-processing ##
Prior to change detection, pre-processing of satellite images is crucial and has the specific objective of creating a more direct connection between biophysical processes and information 

## Land-cover classification scheme ##
A classification scheme that specifies the LULC classes was taken into consideration when creating the LULC map from satellite imagery. The ideal number of LULC classes depends on the specifications of a particular project for a particular application. For mapping the entire watershed region, the five key LULC classifications of built-up area, agricultural land, forest, barren land, and waterbodies were selected (Table 

## Post-processing ##
Delimiting polygons around typical sites allowed training samples to be chosen for each of the specified LULC types. The spectral signatures for the various land cover categories seen in the satellite images were determined using the pixels contained in these polygons. Confusion among them to be mapped land covers is assessed  to be minimal when a spectral signature is deemed to be satisfactory 
A Google Earth Pro examination has been conducted. To carry out supervised classifications, choose a training site, and assess classification accuracy, ground truth data should be collected. The Google Earth Pro was used to gather training and testing interest sites for the ground truth information in this investigation. The current research area classes were defined after interpretation and five LULC classes (built-up area, agricultural land, forest, barren land, and water-bodies) were identified because the google earth pro image has a high spatial resolution.

## LULC change detection ##
The LULC mapping project was expected to produce data on the spatial distribution of land use categories, as well as identify and estimate changes in land use over the previous decades. Furthermore, the number of transitions from one land cover category to another between time periods (1996 and 2019) was quantified. Important information about the spatial distribution of LULC changes is presented by the change matrix 

## Accuracy assessment ##
The comparison of a classification with actual data serves as an accuracy assessment, which determines how accurately the classification captures the real world. Using a random sampling   Settlements, artificial infrastructure, transportation and so on Agricultural Crop fields and fallow lands approach with 200 points, an accuracy assessment of the classified images that resulted in this study was done to examine the quality of the information that was produced from the data. The error matrix was used to conduct this evaluation. To assess the degree of classification accuracy from the report portion of ERDAS Imagine 2015, Kappa statistics and the overall accuracy of the categorised images were conducted.

## Results ##


## Murredu watershed ##
This river's watershed covers 1593 km 2 in total (Fig. 

## LULC scenario of Murredu watershed, 1996 ##
Agriculture accounted for 54.19 percent of the watershed's land area in 1996. Forest (40.30 %) was the watershed's second most prevalent land cover. Because a forest infiltrates the majority of the rain that falls during the monsoon and reduces both soil erosion and surface runoff, it often plays a significant influence in the hydrological features of a watershed. In low land watersheds, it will also lessen flood intensity 

## LULC scenario of Murredu watershed, 2019 ##
After 1996, there was a significant amount of deforestation in the watershed region, which left the land unforested and suitable for agriculture and other uses. The majority of the watershed's land was used for agriculture in 2019 (59.36 %). Forest (30.63 %) was the second most prevalent land cover in the watershed. As shown in Fig. 
Forests are recognised for promoting groundwater recharge and consuming a lot of water through evapotranspiration from the trees 

## Accuracy assessment ##
One of the significant differences between the classified image and the actual or real ground is accuracy evaluation. The accuracy of the 2019 classified map was evaluated using one of the most popular Kappa accuracy assessment techniques. Using highresolution satellite images from Google Earth Pro, 200 stratified random points were generated (Table 

## Conclusion ##
This present study demonstrates how LULC changes in the Murredu drainage basin have altered significantly over the past decades. Overall classification accuracy for the classified image of 2019 was found to be 90 % with overall kappa statistics of 85.98 %. From these findings, change detection analysis shows that the area used for agricultural land, barren land, forest, built-up areas, and waterbodies has increased by 5.17 %, 3.39 %, 0.84 %, and 0.26 %, respectively, between 1996 and 2019. The forest area has decreased by 9.67 % at the same time. The area of forest has decreased, whereas the areas for agriculture, waterbodies, bare land, and built-up areas have all increased. Therefore, this research anticipates that the findings might provide information to planners, land managers, and decision-makers for the sustainable management and development of the natural resource. In a future study, sub-watersheds could be created within the watershed since it is large enough to be included in management practices. Additionally, these sub-watersheds could be given higher priority for management and conservation based on the degree of deterioration.
