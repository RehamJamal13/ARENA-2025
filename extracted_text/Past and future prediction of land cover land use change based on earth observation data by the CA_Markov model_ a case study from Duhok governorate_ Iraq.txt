ABSTRACT:
Understanding land use land cover change (LULCC) dynamics is crucial for sustaining the integrity of structure and function of ecosystems. As such, frequent measuring and monitoring of LULCC are necessary. Over the last four decades, Duhok governorate in the north of Iraq has undergone sweeping changes caused mainly by anthropogenic factors (e.g. population growth). This study used geospatial techniques and the synergy Cellular Automata (CA)-Markov approach to quantify past, current and model the future changes of LULC. The maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) was employed to conduct classification for three consecutive-year Landsat imagery (i.e. 1988, 2008 and 2017). From the classified imageries, three LULC maps with several classes were created and then, change detection analysis was implied. The classified (1988-2008) and (2008-2017)  LULC maps were incorporated into the hybrid model to predict LULC maps for 2017 and 2060, respectively. The classified 2017 LULC maps were used as a reference to validate the model output for 2017.
Relatively high accuracy agreements were achieved between the classified and the modelled maps (Kno= 0.8315, Klocation= 0.8267, Kstandard = 0.7978). The model classes estimated for 2060 compared to the classified 2017 LULC classes revealed that dense forest, sparse forest, agricultural land and barren area would decrease by -26.26% (from 327.08 to 241.08 km 2 ), -0.76% (from 2372.29 to 2355.82 km 2 ), -5.86% (from 973.21 to 916.27 km 2 ) and -10.03% (from 2918.9-2626.19 km 2 ), respectively. In contrast, the urban area would significantly increase by 271.19%, (from 161.99 to 602.19.8 km 2 ).
Dense forest in Duhok governorate has seen remarkable decline from 1988 to 2017, and future predictions demonstrated that the declining trend would continue. Dense forest would predominantly convert to sparse forest and barren areas, suggesting forest thinning and clearing. Urban areas were the most dynamic cover types that increased significantly between 1998 and 2017. This trend would continue to increase from 2.36% (2017) to 8.76% (2060). Urbanization would be predominantly at the cost of agricultural land and barren area. Information on spatiotemporal dynamics of LULCC has been proved as an effective measure for maintaining the integrity of the ecosystem components through sustainable planning and management actions.

## Introduction ##
Land use land cover (LULC) is an important component of the environmental systems. Any changes to LULC can cause many environmental and ecological problems at various spatial scales 
Geospatial technologies, remote sensing (RS) data and geographic information system (GIS) are currently considered to be the most cost-effective and accurate source of information for the detection of changes in LULC 
In addition, there are different models that can be used for LULCC simulation and modelling, such as statistical models 
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Report 2019 
Tracing the impact of urban change on sustainability through time can supply vital information required for sustainable urban progress, particularly in areas where anthropogenic and natural factors are a constant risk 

## Materials and methods ##


## Study area ##
Duhok governorate is located in the north of Iraq, bordering Syria and Turkey, situated between latitudes 36°-37.5°N and longitudes 42°-44°E, with elevations >580 m above sea level (Fig. 

## Historical satellite imagery ##

## flow chart part A). ##
Markov Chain model, cellular automata (CA) model and CA-Markov models
The Markov chain model (MCM) depends on stochastic process which means that how random variable changes over time 
The CA-Markov is an effective combination between the MCM to predict temporal changes in LULC and cellular automata models to predict spatial LULCC, hence, the integrated CA-Markov model can be used effectively to predict spatiotemporal changes in LULCC 

## Model validation ##
Model validation is a crucial step to evaluate the accuracy of predicted data. In this study, the validation was completed by using the classified 2017 LULC map as reference data against the predicted 2017 LULC map based on the standard Kappa index of agreement variations, which have been widely used to validate LULC predictions

## Spatial analysis of LULC change classification ##
The LULC changes were spatially analysed. As shown in  . During that period, the sparse forest has slightly increased by 1.47% whilst, agricultural land and urban area have significantly increased by 223.2% (300 km 2 to 973 km 2 ), and 448.84% (29 km 2 to 161 km 2 ) respectively. In contrast, the dense forest, barren area and waterbody have decreased by -33.43%, -18.69% and -3.35%, respectively (Table 

## Comparison between actual LULC and modelled LULC map of 2017 ##
The degree of agreement between the actual LULC map and the modelled LULC map for the 2017 was R 2 = 0.98 (coefficient of determination) (Fig. 

## Discussion ##
In the study of environmental change, ecosystem integrity (e.g. structure and function), urban planning and sustainability, LULCC has become a key subject that needs to be   
Interesting trends can be seen in the change statistics 
Oppositely, the area of sparse forest slightly increased as this class, in some circumstances, can be a transition stage between dense forest and other classes. Respectively, agricultural lands were increased with a clear jump in 2017. This is likely due to the influence of a recent policy that was implemented by the central government which have encouraged local farmers to increase agricultural production particularly wheat. Across Iraq, the central government has allocated silos to buy wheat from farmers for a pre-declared price above the market price 
The land use type that increased the most over the last four decades is urban area, which increased by six times from 0.37 to 2. 
Increasing the population and development of infrastructure can result in accelerating urban expansion 

## Conclusion ##
Quantifying and predicting spatiotemporal dynamics of LULCCs have become a prerequisite for planning decisions and conserving the integrity of the ecosystems, particularly urban ecosystem as human population grows. Geospatial technologies together with land surface modellers (e.g. CA-Markov) are effective tools in providing invaluable information on the patterns of LCLCs over space and time. Understanding the patterns of changes would supply guidance to various scientific disciplines, for example, biodiversity conservation, sustainable urban systems and environmental management actions.
Dense forest in the Duhok governorate has seen remarkable decline from 1988 to 2017, and future predictions demonstrated that this trend would continue (i.e. from 2017 to 2060). Dense forest cover would predominantly convert to sparse forest and barren areas, suggesting forest thinning and clearing. Therefore, management actions should focus on protecting the forest areas as part of the sustainable development. Moreover, the most dynamic land use type that increased the most over the last four decades was urban area, which increased by six times from 0.37 to 2.
