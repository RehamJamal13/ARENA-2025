L and cover change detection (LCCD) with remote sens- ing images is an important application of Earth observation data because it provides insights into environmental health, global warming, and city management. In particular, very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images can capture details of a ground object and offer an opportunity to detect land cover changes in detail.
However, VHR images usually have high spatial resolution but contain limited spectral information. Therefore, LCCD with VHR optimal images performs poorly because of high intraclass variation and low interclass variance. In the past decades, various approaches have been promoted to smoothen noise, reduce pseudochanges, and preserve the details of detection maps with VHR images.
In this article, we first present an overview of the main issues in terms of algorithms, applications, and referred characteristics to promote a comprehensive and general understanding of the development of LCCD with VHR remote sensing images. Several key methodologies are compared with three pairs of real VHR optimal images. Finally, we discuss future challenges and opportunities in applying VHR remote sensing images in LCCD.

## VHR IMAGE ##
Numerous remote sensing platforms, such as QuickBird, GeoEye, Worldview, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), can capture ground details with VHR, given the considerable progress in remote sensing technology 
However, many studies have demonstrated that high resolution does not automatically mean high detection accuracy in practical applications because of the following reasons: ◗ VHR images usually have a higher intraclass variation than low-or medium-resolution images, resulting in decreased separability between different entities, such as roads and buildings 
Figure 
A VHR image generally has a fine resolution in the spatial domain and a coarse resolution in the spectral domain, but it can describe ground targets in detail in terms of their texture, structure, shape, and size. In recent decades, VHR remote sensing images have been used successfully in many practical applications, such as land cover classification 

## METHODOLOGY ##
Some rules must be defined to retrieve articles on LCCD using VHR remote sensing optical images from a database. In this study, several constraints were defined and applied to achieve the objective: ◗ All of the articles are indexed from the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection database and were published from 2001 to 2019. ◗ The article titles should contain "very high resolution" or "VHR" and "change detection." "Bitemporal images" or "remote sensing images" were used to refine the search results. ◗ If "object" and "change detection" were included in an article's title, then the article would be selected for analysis because object-based techniques are generally employed for processing VHR images 
Based on these criteria, 356 articles were selected after applying the constraints and excluding rules. Moreover, the total number of published articles on LCCD with VHR remote sensing images in each year increased from 2001 to 2019 (Figure 

## REVIEW OF THE MAJOR TECHNIQUES OF LCCD WITH VHR OPTICAL IMAGES ##


## IMAGE PREPROCESSING IN LCCD ##
LCCD usually refers to bitemporal or multitemporal images. Thus, preprocessing is required to reduce pseudochanges caused by geometry position errors and spectral reflectance phenological differences. Here, the two widely employed preprocessing steps for change detection are analyzed as follows.
In LCCD with VHR images, geometric coregistration between bitemporal images in terms of a geographical position is an important preprocessing task because misregistration will bring noise to the detection map 
Han et al. 
However, coregistration between bitemporal images depends on the data preprocessing level. In general, ground control points (GCPs) are needed to achieve the coregistration, and GCPs are usually collected by data providers 
In addition to the preprocessing of coregistration, radiometric cocorrection between bitemporal images is required to reduce pseudochanges in LCCD 
To solve this problem, scholars have developed many methods, such as radiometric normalization 

## EXPLORATION OF NEIGHBORING CONTEXT ##
A number of studies have demonstrated that utilizing spatial contextual information can help improve the detection performance of LCCD with VHR optimal images 

## REGULAR NEIGHBORING CONTEXT ##
similarity 
In addition, regular structural elements coupled with morphological operations are widely used to extract neighboring contextual features in LCCD 
In recent years, many deep learning LCCD frameworks have been developed by dividing image pairs into regular blocks to utilize contextual information, based on such approaches as the convolutional neural network (CNN) 
In addition to constructing a regular geometry around a central pixel to explore neighboring contextual information, mathematical models are widely used to obtain invariant features around a central pixel and measure the change magnitude between pairwise images. Some examples of such mathematical models are Markov random field (MRF) 

## MULTISCALE NEIGHBORING CONTEXT ##
Multiscale techniques can be used to obtain neighboring contextual information around a pixel in bitemporal VHR images (Table 
In recent decades, many object-based methods have been developed for LCCD with VHR images. For example, object-level features were extracted to detect land cover change 
Object-based uncertainty analyses were also used in other studies 
Furthermore, the parameter setting of many multiscale segmentation algorithms is dependent on the user's experience 
Second, multiscale deep learning networks are popular when LCCD is applied on VHR images. These networks include the multiscale CNN 
Other multiscale techniques applicable to LCCD are the multiscale hierarchy LCCD framework 

## ADAPTIVE NEIGHBORING CONTEXT ##
Adaptive neighboring context is another LCCD branch used to cover the various shapes and sizes of ground targets in a scene (Table 
Many adaptive-scale-based LCCD methods have been developed in the past decades. These include methods based on the adaptive window size 
Therefore, the influence of neighboring pixels on the central pixel varies with the spectral reflection of the ground target itself. One advantage of adaptive-scale LCCD methods lies in maintaining the shape of ground targets, improving the homogeneity, and preserving the details of the change area. However, the parameter tuning of adaptivescale methods is generally required in practical application.

## OTHER METHODS FROM COMPUTER VISION ##
In addition to the mentioned LCCD methods, computer vision techniques, such as the binary descriptors algorithms 
Many widely used computer vision techniques, such as line feature extraction 

## RESULTS OF THE LCCD AND PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT ##
Two kinds of change detection maps exist in practical applications. The first major type is called the binary change detection map, and it can only describe the shape, size, and distribution of land cover change. The other is called the multitask change detection map 
In addition to multitask change detection methods, "from-to" change information can be acquired through the feature analysis of ground targets. For example, Wen et al. 
Binary change detection is the most widely used in the family of LCCD with VHR optical images. In addition, one advantage of postclassification-based LCCD methods is their ability to provide "from-to" change information. However, the detection accuracy and performance depends on the classification performance, and the large intraclass variations in VHR images led to difficulty in distinguishing among different classes 
In summary, accuracy assessment is a quantitative measurement to compare and test the performance of an algorithm. Intuitively, this quantitative measurement is achieved by comparing the result of an algorithm with the corresponding ground truth map (GTM). After the indicators employed in the literature were reviewed 
By analyzing the definition of each formula, it can be observed that different indicators have an unequal bias for evaluation, and the performance of a specific algorithm may be better or worse than the one of other methods, depending on the indicator. In numerous practical applications and performance assessments of algorithms, three of the nine indicators are usually selected to assess the performance of an algorithm (i.e., FA, MA, and Ka were adopted in 

## EXPERIMENTS ##
To investigate the performance of LCCD approaches in comparison with VHR optical images, this section compares eight widely used approaches, including three unsupervised methods (CVA_MRF 
The performance of each algorithm was evaluated by using the nine indicators described in Table 

## DISCUSSION ##
To obtain an overview of the development of LCCD with VHR optical images, we statistically analyzed the articles referred to. In accordance with the perspective and focus of these articles, we discussed LCCD with VHR optical images from the following viewpoints: technology, application, data sets, and accuracy assessment. The details of this quantitative analysis are presented in the following sections.

## TECHNIQUES ##
As mentioned in the previous section, here, we dichotomized the major LCCD methods into four groups in terms of different manners of utilizing spatial contextual information: regular neighboring context 
Moreover, the optimal parameter's setting of an adaptive context exploration algorithm for a specific data set remains a challenge 

## Missing alarm (MA) MA TP FN FN = + ##
The ratio between the number of pixels that are identified as "unchanged" but are changed in the GTM and the number of pixels that are changed in the GTM.

## Total error (TE) TE TP TN FP FN TP TN ##
The ratio between the number of pixels that are identified as "unchanged" but are changed in the GTM and the number of pixels that are changed in the GTM.
Overall accuracy (OA) OA TP TN FP FN TP TN = + + +

## + ##
The ratio between the number of correctly detected pixels in the result and the total number of the GTM. 
The AA is for two ratios: one is the ratio between the true changed pixel in the results and the changed pixel in the GTM, and the other is the ratio between the true unchanged pixel in the results and the unchanged pixels in the GTM.

## Completeness (CP) CP TP FN TP = + ##
The ratio between the number of changed pixels that are correctly identified and the number of the pixels that are changed in the GTM.

## Correctness (CR) CR TP FP TP = + ##
The ratio between the number of changed pixels that are correctly identified and the total number of changed pixels in the result.
The ratio between the number of changed pixels that are correctly identified and the number of total changed pixels in the results and GTM. Based on these observations, 92 study areas were located in the urban region, accounting for 30% of the total quantity. In addition, building change detection played an important role in change detection with VHR optical images, accounting for 23.8% of the 307 applications in the 356 articles. However, the application of such methods to disaster change detection, such as earthquake and landslide inventory mapping, has not gained sufficient attention, probably because of the difficulty of acquiring pre-and postevent images for natural disaster events. Furthermore, coregistration between bitemporal images becomes challenging because land cover disasters, such as landslides and earthquakes, usually result in the deformation of ground elevation.

## DATA SETS ##
Data sets are important in investigating the performance of LCCD algorithms. If an algorithm adapts to more kinds of data sets with different resolutions, then it may have better adaptability and robustness 
In addition, the size of the study areas mentioned in the articles is reviewed. Area units were measured in square kilometers, and five ranges were divided for quantitative analysis, where S denotes the study area size (Figure 
That is because, in general, for specific geographical areas, the complexity of spatial certainty increases with an increase in the size of a geographic area 

## ACCURACY ASSESSMENT ##
The quantitative accuracies of each approach and data set in the experimental section well demonstrated that it is difficult to mark one method as "good" or "bad" in terms of the nine assessment indicators. For example, for data set A, the developed DCVA 

## CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES OF LCCD WITH VHR IMAGES ##
Despite the numerous approaches for LCCD with VHR images that have been developed, challenges still exist in practical applications. In this study, these were mentioned from the viewpoint of practitioners, and opportunities were discussed from the perspective of researchers. The details of the challenges and opportunities are presented as follows:
◗ Radiometric cocorrection requires additional attention: Despite the availability of various LCCD techniques, radiometric cocorrection is required for images used in LCCD.
The effect of radiometric cocorrection between bitemporal images on the accuracy of change detection maps still requires further investigation. Bitemporal images used in LCCD are usually acquired on different dates, and the process may vary in terms of sun height, atmospheric conditions, and even the phenology season. Thus, a radiometric difference exists between bitempo- (d) KPVD 
ral images. The radiometric cocorrection of noise should be considered in comprehensive analyses to promote the development of the method and reduce the radiometric difference between bitemporal images in LCCD. ◗ LCCD based on bitemporal images with different resolutions is attractive in practical applications: In the selected 356 articles, only two mentioned different resolutions in LCCD with VHR images 

## CONCLUSION ##
LCCD with VHR optical images plays an important role in remote sensing. This approach provides an opportunity to discover, describe, and analyze land cover changes on Earth's surface. The rapid development of remote sensing platforms has provided the convenient availability of VHR remote sensing images. VHR optical images have become an important data source for the detection of land cover change. Designing advanced algorithms for these images is necessary to increase the popularity of change detection with VHR images and their potential applications in practical engineering.
In this article, the problems of LCCD with VHR remote sensing images were reviewed and analyzed in terms of algorithms, data sets, and applications. Challenges and opportunities were then discussed. Our study provides an overview of the available LCCD methods with VHR remote sensing images. Furthermore, the characteristics of the (d) KPVD 
study areas mentioned in the corresponding methods in the literature, such as data sources and size, were quantitatively analyzed. Results may provide an objective assessment for future investigations.
In general, many issues, such as implementing an advanced radiometric cocorrection method in the preprocessing of bitemporal images to reduce a radiometric difference, still require further investigation and analysis. Almost all object-based LCCD methods focus on utilizing low-level object-based features of a single object, such as the spectral mean, textural characteristics, and other statistical features. High-level features, such as the topology of an object and its neighbors, should be extensively analyzed in future studies. Furthermore, time series images of an area have become available, and time series change detection and change trend analysis must be considered in LCCD with VHR remote sensing images.
