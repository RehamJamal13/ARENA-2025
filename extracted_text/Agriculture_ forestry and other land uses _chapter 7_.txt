ABSTRACT:
AFOLU CO 2 sink in Europe due to forest regrowth and known other sinks in managed forests, and medium confidence of a net sink in North America and Eurasia since 2010.
Difference in Results?
The processes responsible for fluxes from land have been divided into three categories 
Global models estimate the anthropogenic land CO 2 flux considering only the impact of direct effects, and only those areas that were subject to intense and direct management such as clear-cut harvest. It is important to note, that DGVMs also estimate the non-anthropogenic land CO 2 flux (Land Sink) that results from indirect and natural effects (Table 
The approach used by countries follows the IPCC methodological guidance for NGHGIs

## Executive Summary ##
The Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 1 (AFOLU) sector encompasses managed ecosystems and offers significant mitigation opportunities while delivering food, wood and other renewable resources as well as biodiversity conservation, provided the sector adapts to climate change. Land-based mitigation measures represent some of the most important options currently available. They can both deliver carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and substitute for fossil fuels, thereby enabling emissions reductions in other sectors. The rapid deployment of AFOLU measures is essential in all pathways staying within the limits of the remaining budget for a 1.5°C target (high confidence). Where carefully and appropriately implemented, AFOLU mitigation measures are uniquely positioned to deliver substantial co-benefits and help address many of the wider challenges associated with land management. If AFOLU measures are deployed badly then, when taken together with the increasing need to produce sufficient food, feed, fuel and wood, they may exacerbate trade-offs with the conservation of habitats, adaptation, biodiversity and other services. At the same time the capacity of the land to support these functions may be threatened by climate change itself (high confidence). {IPCC AR6 WGI, Figure SPM.7; IPCC AR6 WGII, 7.1, 7.6}
The AFOLU (managed land) sector, on average, accounted for 13-21% of global total anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the period 2010-2019 (medium confidence). At the same time managed and natural terrestrial ecosystems were a carbon sink, absorbing around one third of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions (medium confidence). Estimated anthropogenic net CO 2 emissions from AFOLU (based on book-keeping models) result in a net source of +5.9 ± 4.1 GtCO 2 yr -1 between 2010 and 2019 with an unclear trend. Based on FAOSTAT or national GHG inventories, the net CO 2 emissions from AFOLU were 0.0 to +0.8 GtCO 2 yr -1 over the same period. There is a discrepancy in the reported CO 2 AFOLU emissions magnitude because alternative methodological approaches that incorporate different assumptions are used. If the managed and natural responses of all land to both anthropogenic environmental change and natural climate variability, estimated to be a gross sink of -12.5 ± 3.2 GtCO 2 yr -1 for the period 2010-2019, are included with land use emissions, then land overall, constituted a net sink of -6.6 ± 5.2 GtCO 2 yr -1 in terms of CO 2 emissions (medium confidence). {7.2, 7.2.2.5, Table 
There are substantial regional differences, with losses of carbon generally observed in tropical regions and gains in temperate and
Global databases make different choices about which emissions and removals occurring on land are considered anthropogenic. Currently, net CO 2 land fluxes from land reported by global book-keeping models used here differ from those from the aggregate global net emissions based on national GHG inventories. This difference, which has been considered in the literature, mainly reflects differences in how anthropogenic forest sinks and areas of managed land are defined. Other reasons for this difference, which are more difficult to quantify, can arise from the limited representation of land management in global models and varying levels of accuracy and completeness of estimated LULUCF fluxes in national GHG inventories. Neither method is inherently preferable. This chapter reports estimates from different databases and approaches, but uses CO 2 LULUCF from book-keeping models to report overall emissions to ensure consistency and comparability across chapters.
boreal regions. Agricultural methane (CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions are estimated to average 157 ± 47.1 MtCH 4 yr -1 and 6.6 ± 4.0 MtN 2 O yr -1 or 4.2 ± 1.3 and 1.8 ± 1.1 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 (using IPCC AR6 GWP100 values for CH 4 and N 2 O) respectively between 2010 and 2019. AFOLU CH 4 emissions continue to increase (high confidence), the main source of which is enteric fermentation from ruminant animals (high confidence). Similarly, AFOLU N 2 O emissions are increasing, dominated by agriculture, notably from manure application, nitrogen deposition, and nitrogen fertiliser use (high confidence). In addition to being a source and sink for GHG emissions, land plays an important role in climate through albedo effects, evapotranspiration and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their mix, although the combined role in total climate forcing is unclear and varies strongly with bioclimatic region and management type. {2.4.2.5, 7.2, 7.2.1, 7.2.3, 7.3}
The AFOLU sector offers significant near-term mitigation potential at relatively low cost but cannot compensate for delayed emission reductions in other sectors (high evidence, medium agreement). The AFOLU sector can provide 20-30% (interquartile range) of the global mitigation needed for a 1.5°C or 2°C pathway towards 2050 (robust evidence, medium agreement), though there are highly variable mitigation strategies for how AFOLU potential can be deployed for achieving climate targets. The estimated likely economic (<USD100 tCO 2 -eq -1 ) AFOLU sector mitigation potential is 8 to 14 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 between 2020 and 2050, with the bottom end of this range representing the mean from integrated assessment models (IAMs) and the upper end representing the mean estimate from global sectoral studies. The economic potential is about half of the technical potential from AFOLU, and about 30-50% could be achieved under USD20 tCO 2 -eq -1 . The implementation of robust measurement, reporting and verification processes is paramount to improving the transparency of net-carbon-stock changes per land unit to prevent misleading assumptions or claims on mitigation. {7. 
Most mitigation options are available and ready to deploy. Emissions reductions can be unlocked relatively quickly, whereas CDR needs upfront investment. Sustainable intensification in agriculture, shifting diets, and reducing food waste could enhance efficiencies and reduce agricultural land needs, and are therefore critical for enabling supply-side measures such as reforestation, restoration, as well as decreasing CH 4 and N 2 O emissions from agricultural production. In addition, emerging technologies (e.g., vaccines or inhibitors) have the potential to substantially increase CH 4 mitigation potential beyond current estimates. AFOLU mitigation is not only relevant in countries with large land areas. Many smaller countries and regions, particularly with wetlands, have disproportionately high levels of AFOLU mitigation potential density. {7.4, 7.5}
The economic and political feasibility of implementing AFOLU mitigation measures is hampered by persistent barriers. Assisting countries to overcome barriers will help to achieve significant short-term mitigation (medium confidence).
Finance forms a critical barrier to achieving these gains as currently mitigation efforts rely principally on government sources and funding mechanisms which do not provide sufficient resources to enable the economic potential to be realised. Differences in cultural values, governance, accountability and institutional capacity are also important barriers. Climate change could also emerge as a barrier to AFOLU mitigation, although the IPCC AR6 WGI contribution to AR6 indicated that an increase in the capacity of natural sinks may occur, despite changes in climate (medium confidence). The continued loss of biodiversity makes ecosystems less resilient to climate change extremes and this may further jeopardise the achievement of the AFOLU mitigation potentials indicated in this chapter (IPCC AR6 WGII and IPBES) (high confidence). {7.4, 7.6; IPCC AR6 WGI, Figure SPM.7}
Bioenergy and other bio-based options represent an important share of the total mitigation potential. The range of recent estimates for the technical bioenergy potential when constrained by food security and environmental considerations is 5-50 and 50-250 EJ yr -1 by 2050 for residues and dedicated biomass production system respectively. These estimates fall within previously estimated ranges (medium agreement). Poorly planned deployment of biomass production and afforestation options for in-forest carbon sequestration may conflict with environmental and social dimensions of sustainability (high confidence). The global technical CDR potential of BECCS by 2050 (considering only the technical capture of CO 2 and storage underground) is estimated at 5.9 mean (0.5-11.3) GtCO 2 yr -1 , of which 1.6 (0.8-3.5) GtCO 2 yr -1 is available at below USD100 tCO 2 -1
(medium confidence). Bioenergy and other bio-based products provide additional mitigation through the substitution of fossil fuels fossil-based products (high confidence). These substitution effects are reported in other sectors. Wood used in construction may reduce emissions associated with steel and concrete use. The agriculture and forestry sectors can devise management approaches that enable biomass production and use for energy in conjunction with the production of food and timber, thereby reducing the conversion pressure on natural ecosystems (medium confidence). {7.4}
The deployment of all land-based mitigation measures can provide multiple co-benefits, but there are also risks and trade-offs from misguided or inappropriate land management (high confidence). Such risks can best be managed if AFOLU mitigation is pursued in response to the needs and perspectives of multiple stakeholders to achieve outcomes that maximise synergies while limiting trade-offs (medium confidence). The results of implementing AFOLU measures are often variable and highly context specific. Depending on local conditions (e.g., ecosystem, climate, food system, land ownership) and management strategies (e.g., scale, method), mitigation measures have the potential to positively or negatively impact biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, air quality, water availability and quality, soil productivity, rights infringements, food security, and human well-being. Mitigation measures addressing GHGs may also affect other climate forcers such as albedo and evapotranspiration. Integrated responses that contribute to mitigation, adaptation, and other land challenges will have greater likelihood of being successful (high confidence); measures which provide additional benefits to biodiversity and human well-being are sometimes described as 'Nature-Based Solutions'. {7.1, 7.4, 7.6}

## AFOLU mitigation measures have been well understood for decades but deployment remains slow and emissions trends indicate unsatisfactory progress despite beneficial contributions to global emissions reduction from forestrelated options (high confidence). ##
Globally, the AFOLU sector has so far contributed modestly to net mitigation, as past policies have delivered about 0.65 GtCO 2 yr -1 of mitigation during 2010-2019 or 1.4% of global gross emissions (high confidence). The majority (>80%) of emission reduction resulted from forestry measures (high confidence). Although the mitigation potential of AFOLU measures is large from a biophysical and ecological perspective, its feasibility is hampered by lack of institutional support, uncertainty over longterm additionality and trade-offs, weak governance, fragmented land ownership, and uncertain permanence effects. Despite these impediments to change, AFOLU mitigation options are demonstrably effective and with appropriate support can enable rapid emission reductions in most countries. {7.4, 7.6}
Concerted, rapid and sustained effort by all stakeholders, from policy makers and investors to land owners and managers is a pre-requisite to achieving high levels of mitigation in the AFOLU sector (high confidence). To date USD0.7 billion yr -1 is estimated to have been spent on AFOLU mitigation. This is well short of the more than USD400 billion yr -1 that is estimated to be necessary to deliver the up to 30% of global mitigation effort envisaged in deep mitigation scenarios (medium confidence). This estimate of the global funding requirement is smaller than current subsidies provided to agriculture and forestry. Making this funding available would require a change in flows of money and determination of who pays.
A gradual redirection of existing agriculture and forestry subsidies would greatly advance mitigation. Effective policy interventions and national (investment) plans as part of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), specific to local circumstances and needs, are urgently needed to accelerate the deployment of AFOLU mitigation options. These interventions are effective when they include funding schemes and long-term consistent support for implementation with governments taking the initiative together with private funders and non-state actors. {7.6}
Realising the mitigation potential of the AFOLU sector depends strongly on policies that directly address emissions and drive the deployment of land-based mitigation options, consistent with carbon prices in deep mitigation scenarios (high confidence). Examples of successful policies and measures include establishing and respecting tenure rights and community forestry, improved agricultural management and sustainable intensification, biodiversity conservation, payments for ecosystem services, improved forest management and wood chain usage, bioenergy, voluntary supply chain management efforts, consumer behaviour campaigns, private funding and joint regulatory efforts to avoid, for example, leakage. The efficacy of different policies, however, will depend on numerous region-specific factors. In addition to funding, these factors include governance, institutions, long-term consistent execution of measures, and the specific policy setting (high confidence). {7.6}
There is a discrepancy, equating to 5.5 GtCO 2 yr -1 between alternative methods of accounting for anthropogenic land CO 2 fluxes. Reconciling these methods greatly enhances the credibility of AFOLU-based emissions offsetting. It would also assist in assessing collective progress in a global stocktake (high confidence). The principal accounting approaches are national GHG inventories (NGHGI) and global modelling approaches. NGHGI, based on IPCC guidelines, consider a much larger area of forest to be under human management than global models. NGHGI consider the fluxes due to human-induced environmental change on this area to be anthropogenic and are thus reported. Global models,
Addressing the many knowledge gaps in the development and testing of AFOLU mitigation options can rapidly advance the likelihood of achieving sustained mitigation (high confidence). Research priorities include improved quantification of anthropogenic and natural GHG fluxes and emissions modelling, better understanding of the impacts of climate change on the mitigation potential, permanence and additionality of estimated mitigation actions, and improved (real time and cheap) measurement, reporting and verification. There is a need to include a greater suite of mitigation measures in IAMs, informed by more realistic assessments that take into account local circumstances and socio-economic factors and cross-sector synergies and trade-offs. Finally, there is a critical need for more targeted research to develop appropriate country-level, locally specific, policy and land management response options. These options could support more specific NDCs with AFOLU measures that enable mitigation while also contributing to biodiversity conservation, ecosystem functioning, livelihoods for millions of farmers and foresters, and many other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (high confidence). {7.7}

## Introduction ##


## Key Findings from Previous Reports ##
Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Uses (AFOLU) is unique due to its capacity to mitigate climate change through greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions, as well as enhance removals 
The SRCCL (IPCC 2019) outlined with medium evidence and medium agreement that supply-side agriculture and forestry measures had an economic (at USD100 tCO 2 -eq -1 ) mitigation potential of 7.2-10.6 GtCO 2 -eq -1 in 2030 (using GWP100 and multiple IPCC values for CH 4 and N 2 O) of which about a third was estimated as achievable at <USD20 tCO 2 -eq -1 . Agricultural measures were reported as sensitive to carbon price, with cropland and grazing land soil organic carbon management having the greatest potential at USD20 tCO 2 -eq -1 and restoration of organic soils at USD100 tCO 2 -eq -1 . Forestry measures were less sensitive to carbon price, but varied regionally, with reduced deforestation, forest management and afforestation having the greatest potential depending on region. Although demand-side measures related to food could in theory make a large contribution to mitigation, in reality the contribution has been very small. Overall, the dependency of mitigation within AFOLU on a complex range of factors, from population growth, economic and technological developments, to the sustainability of mitigation measures and impacts of climate change, was suggested to make realisation highly challenging (IPCC 2019).
Land can only be part of the solution alongside rapid emission reduction in other sectors 
Since the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), the share of AFOLU to anthropogenic GHG emissions had remained largely unchanged at 13-21% of total GHG emissions (medium confidence), though uncertainty in estimates of both sources and sinks of CO 2 , exacerbated by difficulties in separating natural and anthropogenic fluxes, was emphasised. Models indicated land (including the natural sink) to have very likely provided a net removal of CO 2 between 2007 and 2016. As in AR5, land cover change, notably deforestation, was identified as a major driver of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions while agriculture was a major driver of the increasing anthropogenic CH 4 and N 2 O emissions.
In terms of mitigation, without reductions in overall anthropogenic emissions, increased reliance on large-scale land-based mitigation was predicted, which would add to the many already competing demands on land. However, some mitigation measures were suggested to not compete with other land uses, while also having multiple co-benefits, including adaptation capacity and potential synergies with some Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As in AR5, there was large uncertainty surrounding mitigation within AFOLU, in part because current carbon stocks and fluxes are unclear and subject to temporal variability. Additionally, the non-additive nature of individual measures that are often inter-linked and the highly context specific applicability of measures, causes further uncertainty. Many AFOLU measures were considered well-established and some achievable at low to moderate cost, yet contrasting economic drivers, insufficient policy, lack of incentivisation and institutional support to stimulate implementation among the many stakeholders involved, in regionally diverse contexts, was recognised as hampering realisation of potential.
None the less, the importance of mitigation within AFOLU was highlighted in all IPCC reports, with modelled scenarios demonstrating the considerable potential role and land-based mitigation forming an important component of pledged mitigation in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. The sector was identified as the only one in which large-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR) may currently and at short term be possible (e.g., through afforestation/reforestation or soil organic carbon management). This CDR component was deemed crucial to limit climate change and its impacts, which would otherwise lead to enhanced release of carbon from land. However, the SRCCL emphasised that mitigation cannot be pursued in isolation. The need for integrated response options, that mitigate and adapt to climate change, but also deal with land degradation and desertification, while enhancing food and fibre security, biodiversity and contributing to other SDGs has been made clear 

## Boundaries, Scope and Changing Context of the Current Report ##
This chapter assesses GHG fluxes between land and the atmosphere due to AFOLU, the associated drivers behind these fluxes, mitigation response options and related policy, at time scales of 2030 and 2050. Land and its management has important links with other sectors and therefore associated chapters within this report, notably concerning the provision of food, feed, fuel or fibre for human consumption and societal well-being (Chapter 5), for bioenergy (Chapter 6), the built environment (Chapter 9), transport (Chapter 10) and industry 
As highlighted in both AR5 and the SRCCL, there is a complex interplay between land management and GHG fluxes as illustrated in Figure 
Mitigation measures are broadly categorised as those relating to (i) forests and other ecosystems (ii) agriculture (iii) biomass production for products and bioenergy and (iv) demand-side levers.
Assessment is made in the context that land-mitigation is expected to contribute roughly 25% of the 2030 mitigation pledged in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement 
1. What is the latest estimated (economic) mitigation potential of AFOLU measures according to both sectoral studies and integrated assessment models, and how much of this may be realistic within each global region? 2. How do we realise the mitigation potential, while minimising trade-offs and risks and maximising co-benefits that can enhance food and fibre security, conserve biodiversity and address other land challenges?
3. How effective have policies been so far and what additional policies or incentives might enable realisation of mitigation potential and at what costs?
This chapter first outlines the latest trends in AFOLU fluxes and the methodology supporting their estimation (Section 7.2). Direct and indirect drivers behind emission trends are discussed in Section 7.3. Mitigation measures, their costs, co-benefits, trade-offs, estimated regional potential and contribution within integrated global mitigation scenarios, is presented in Sections 7.4 and 7.5 respectively. Assessment of associated policy responses and links with SDGs are explored in Section 7.6. The chapter concludes with gaps in knowledge (Section 7.7) and frequently asked questions.

## Historical and Current Trends in GHG Emission and Removals; Their Uncertainties and Implications for Assessing Collective Climate Progress ##
The biosphere on land and in wetlands is a source and sink of CO 2 and CH 4 , and a source of N 2 O due to both natural and anthropogenic processes that happen simultaneously and are therefore difficult to disentangle 
A range of methodological approaches and data have been applied to estimating AFOLU emissions and removals, each developed for their own purposes, with estimates varying accordingly. Since the SRCCL

Total global net anthropogenic GHG emissions from AFOLU were 11.9 ± 4.4 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 on average over the period 2010-2019, around 21% of total global net anthropogenic GHG emissions (Table

Comparisons with other estimates are discussed in 7.2.2. Based on NGHGIs and FAOSTAT, the range is 0 to 0.8 GtCO 2 yr -1 . c CH 4 and N 2 O emission estimates and assessed uncertainty of 30 and 60% respectively, are based on Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) data 
f The NGHGIs take a different approach to calculating 'anthropogenic' CO 2 fluxes than the models (Section 7.2.2). In particular the sinks due to environmental change (indirect anthropogenic fluxes) on managed lands are generally treated as anthropogenic in NGHGIs and non-anthropogenic in models such as bookkeeping and IAMs. A reconciliation of the results between IAMs and NGHGIs is presented in Cross-Chapter Box 6 in this chapter. If applied to this table, it would transfer approximately -5.5 GtCO 2 yr -1 (a sink) from Column E (which would become -7.0 GtCO 2 yr -1 ) to Column A (which would then be 0.4 GtCO 2 yr -1 ). approaches that incorporate different assumptions are used (Section 7.2.2.2). While there is low agreement in the trend of global AFOLU CO 2 emissions over the past few decades (Section 7.2.2), they have remained relatively constant (medium confidence) (Chapter 2). Average non-CO 2 emission (aggregated using GWP100 IPCC AR6 values) from agriculture have risen from 5.2 ± 1.4 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 for the period 1990 to 1999, to 6.0 ± 1.7 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 for the period 2010 to 2019 
To present a fuller understanding of land-atmosphere interactions, Table 
and atmospheric observations concur that, when combining both anthropogenic (AFOLU) and natural processes on the entire land surface (the total 'land-atmosphere flux'), the land was a global net sink for CO 2 of -6.6 ± 4.6 GtCO 2 yr -1 with a range for 2010 to 2019 from -4.4 to -8.4 GtCO 2 yr -1 . 

## 7.2.2 ##
Flux of CO 2 from AFOLU, and the Non-anthropogenic Land Sink
Comparison of estimates of the global net AFOLU flux of CO 2 from diverse approaches (Figure 
Yellow line: Net flux estimate from National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (NGHGI) based on country reports to the UNFCCC for LULUCF 
Regionally (Figure 
The FAOSTAT approach is conceptually similar to NGHGIs. FAOSTAT data on forests are based on country reports to FAO-FRA 2020 (FAO 2020a), and include changes in biomass carbon stock in 'forest land' and 'net forest conversions' in five-year intervals. 'Forest land' may include unmanaged natural forest, leading to possible overall overestimation of anthropogenic fluxes for both sources and sinks, though emissions from deforestation are likely underestimated 
Further, the DGVMs and bookkeeping models do not include a wide range of practices which are implicitly covered by the inventories; for example: forest dynamics 
Increasingly, higher emissions estimates are expected from DGVMs compared to bookkeeping models, because DGVMs include a loss of additional sink capacity of 3.3 ± 1.1 GtCO 2 yr -1 on average over 2009-2018, which is increasing with larger climate and CO 2 impacts 
Carbon emissions from peat burning have been estimated based on the Global Fire Emission Database (GFED4s; van der Werf et al. 2017). These were included in the bookkeeping model estimates and added 2.0 GtC over 1960-2019 (e.g., causing the peak in South-East Asia in 1998) (Figure 
Remote-sensing products provide valuable spatial and temporal land-use and biomass data globally (including in remote areas), at potentially high spatial and temporal resolutions, that can be used to calculate CO 2 fluxes, but have mostly been applied only to forests at the global or even regional scale. While such data can strongly support monitoring reporting and verification, estimates of forest carbon fluxes directly from Earth Observation (EO) data vary considerably in both their magnitude and sign (i.e., whether forests are a net source or sink of carbon can in part be explained by spatial resolution of the datasets, the definition of 'forest' and the inclusion of processes and methods used to determine degradation and growth in intact and secondary forests, or the changes in algorithm over time 
Remote sensing products can help to attribute changes to anthropogenic activity or natural inter-annual climate variability 
Since changing the NGHGIs' approach is impractical, an interim method to translate and adjust the output of global models was outlined for reconciling a bookkeeping model and NGHGIs 

## Cross-Chapter ##
In fact, there is about 5.5 GtCO 2 yr -1 difference during 2005-2015 between global anthropogenic land CO 2 net flux estimates of IAMs and aggregated NGHGIs, due to different conceptual approaches to what is 'anthropogenic'. This approach and its implications when comparing climate targets with global mitigation pathways are illustrated in this Box Figure 
By adjusting the original IAM output (Cross-Chapter Box 6, Figure 
Cross-Chapter Box 6 (continued)
The UNEP's annual assessment of the global 2030 'emission gap' between aggregated country NDCs and specific target mitigation pathways (UNEP 2020), is only affected to a limited degree. This is because some estimates of global emissions under the NDCs already use the same land-use definitions as the IAM mitigation pathways 
The approach to deriving a NGHGI-comparable emission pathways presented here can be further refined with improved estimates of the future forest sink. Its use would enable a more accurate assessment of the collective progress achieved and of mitigation pledges under the Paris Agreement. LULUCF -where no adjustment is needed -and the NGHGI-comparable CO 2 pathways for LULUCF 
The SRCCL reported with medium evidence and high agreement that ruminants and rice production were the most important contributors to overall growth trends in atmospheric CH 4 
The SRCCL also noted a trend of increasing with the average share from agriculture remaining approximately the same (96%). Agricultural soils were identified in the SRCCL and in recent literature as a dominant emission source, notably due to nitrogen fertiliser and manure applications to croplands, and manure production and deposition on pastures 
Aggregation of CH 4 and N 2 O to CO 2 equivalence (using GWP100 IPCC AR6 values), suggests that AFOLU emissions increased by 15% between 1990 and 2019, though emissions showed trend variability year to year. Agriculture accounted for 91% of AFOLU emissions on average over the period 
In agreement with AR5 
The SRCCL provided limited discussion on regional variation in agricultural N 2 O emissions but reported with medium confidence that certain regions (North America, Europe, East and South Asia) were notable sources of grazing land N 2 O emissions 

## Biophysical Effects and Short-lived Climate Forcers ##
Despite new literature, general conclusions from the SRCCL and WGI-AR6 on biophysical effects and short-lived climate forcers remain the same. Changes in land conditions from land cover change or land management jointly affect water, energy, and aerosol fluxes (biophysical fluxes) as well as GHG fluxes (biogeochemical fluxes) exchanged between the land and atmosphere (high agreement, robust evidence) 
Studies of biophysical effects have increased since AR5 reaching high agreement for the effects of changes in land condition on surface albedo 

## Drivers ##

## Anthropogenic Direct Drivers: Deforestation, Conversion of Other Ecosystems, and Land Degradation ##
The global forest area in 2020 is estimated at 4.1 billion ha, representing 31% of the total land area (FAO 2020a). Most forests are situated in the tropics (45%), followed by boreal (27%), temperate (16%) and subtropical (11%) domains. Considering regional distribution of global forest area, Europe and the Russian Federation accounts for 25%, followed by South America (21%), North and Central America (19%), Africa (16%), Asia (15%) and Oceania (5%). However, a significant share (54%) of the world's forest area concerns five countries -The Russian Federation, Brazil, Canada, the USA and China (FAO 2020a For each category of explanatory variables (left-hand side), the meta-analysis determined whether the driver variables in that category were consistently associated with higher rates of deforestation, lower rates of deforestation, or neither (not consistent). For example, a ratio of -4x indicates that a variable is associated with less deforestation four times as often as it is associated with more deforestation. Globally, the area of the more open, other wooded land is also of significant importance, with almost 1 billion hectares (FAO 2020a). The area of other wooded land decreased by 

## Conversion of Natural Ecosystems to Agriculture ##
Previous IPCC reports identify land-use change as an important driver of emissions and agriculture as a key driver of land-use change, causing both deforestation and wetland drainage (P.

Although built-up areas (defined as cities, towns, villages and human infrastructure) occupy a relatively small fraction of land (around 1% of global land), since 1975 urban clusters (i.e., urban centres as well as surrounding suburbs) have expanded approximately 2.5 times (UNEP 2019; Chapter 8, this report). Regional differences are striking. Between 1975 and 2015, built-up areas doubled in size in Europe while urban population remained relatively constant. In Africa builtup areas grew approximately fourfold, while urban population tripled (UNEP 2019). Trends indicate that rural-to-urban migration will continue and accelerate in developing countries increasing environmental pressure in spite of measures to mitigate some of the impacts (e.g., by preserving or enhancing natural systems within cities, for example, lakes or natural and urban green infrastructures (UNEP 2019). If current population densities within cities remain stable, the extent of built-up areas in developed countries is expected to increase by 30% and triple in developing countries between 2000 and 2050 
Urban expansion leads to landscape fragmentation and urban sprawl with effects on forest resources and land use 

## Box 7.1 | Case Study: Reducing the Impacts of Roads on Deforestation Summary ##
Rapidly expanding roads, particularly in tropical regions, are linked to forest loss, degradation, and fragmentation because the land becomes more generally accessible. Increase of land values of areas adjacent to roads also drives speculation and deforestation related to land tenure 

## Background ##
Although the number and extent of protected areas has increased markedly in recent decades 

## Case description ##
From 2010 to 2050, the total length of paved roads is projected to increase by 25 million km 

## Interactions and limitations ##
More than any other proximate factor, the dramatic expansion of roads is determining the pace and patterns of habitat disruption and its impacts on biodiversity 

## Lessons ##
The large-scale, proactive land-use planning is an option for managing the development of modern infrastructure. Approaches such as the 'Global Roadmap' scheme 

## Extractive Industry Development ##
The extent and scale of mining is growing due to increased global demand (UNEP 2019). Due to declining ore grades, more ore needs to be processed to meet demand, with extensive use of open cast mining. A low-carbon future may be more mineral intensive with, for example, clean energy technologies requiring greater inputs in comparison to fossil-fuel-based technologies 
Mining is also an important driver of deforestation in African and Asian countries. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the secondlargest area of tropical forest in the world occurs, mining-related deforestation exacerbated by violent conflict 

## Fire Regime Changes ##
Wildland fires account for approximately 70% of the global biomass burned annually (van der 
About 98 Mha of forest and savannahs are estimated to have been affected by fire in 2015 

## Logging and Fuelwood Harvest ##
The area of forest designated for production has been relatively stable since 1990. Considering forest uses, about 30% (1.2 billion ha) of all forests is used primarily for production (wood and non-wood forest products), about 10% (424 Mha) is designated for biodiversity conservation, 398 Mha for the protection of soil and water, and 186 Mha is allocated for social services (recreation, tourism, education research and the conservation of cultural and spiritual sites) 
Over-extraction of wood for timber and fuelwood is identified as an important driver of mangrove deforestation and degradation 

## Anthropogenic Direct ##


## Indirect Drivers ##
The indirect drivers behind how humans both use and impact natural resources are outlined in Table 

## Demography ##
Global and regional trends in population growth: There was a 43% increase in global population between 1990 and 2018. The greatest growth was observed in Africa and the Middle East (+104%) and least growth in Eastern Europe and West-Central Asia (+7%) (FAO 2019b).

## Global and regional projections: ##
Population is projected to increase by 28% between 2018 and 2050 reaching 9.7 billion 
Human migration: Growing mobility and population are linked to human migration, a powerful driver of changes in land and resource use patterns at decadal time scales, with the dominant flow of people being from rural areas to urban settlements over the past few decades, notably in the developing world 

## Economic development and cultural factors ##
Changes in land use and management come from individual and social responses to economic opportunities (e.g., demand for a particular commodity or improved market access), mediated by institutions and policies (e.g., agricultural subsidies and low-interest credit or government-led infrastructure projects) 
Projections on consumption: If the future global population adopts a per capita consumption rate similar to that of the developed world, the global capacity to provide land-based resources will be exceeded 
Global trade: Market distorting agricultural subsidies and globalisation increases pressure on land systems and functions, with global trade and capital flow influencing land use, notably in developing countries 

## Science and technology ##
Technological factors operates in conjunction with economic drivers of land use and management, whether through intensified farming techniques and biotechnology, high-input approaches to rehabilitating degraded land (e.g., 
Changes in farming and forestry systems: Changes can have both positive and negative impacts regarding multiple factors, including GHG emission trends. Fast advancing technologies shape production and consumption, and drive land-use patterns and terrestrial ecosystems at various scales. Innovation is expected to help drive increases in global crop production during the next decade (OECD/FAO 2019). For example, emerging gene editing technologies, may advance crop breeding capabilities, though are subject to biosafety, public acceptance and regulatory approval 
Research and development are central to forest restoration strategies that have become increasingly important around the world as costs vary depending on methods used, from natural regeneration with native tree species to active restoration using site preparation and planting 
Emerging mitigation technologies: Chemically synthesised methanogen inhibitors for ruminants are expected to be commercially available in some countries within the next two years and have considerable CH 4 mitigation potential 

## Institutions and governance ##
Institutional factors often moderate the relevance and impact of changes in economic and demographic variables related to resource exploitation and use. Institutions encompass the rule of law, legal frameworks and other social structures (e.g., civil society networks and movements) determining land management (e.g., formal and informal property rights, regimes and their enforcement); information and knowledge exchange systems; local and traditional knowledge and practice systems 
Land rights: Land tenure often allows communities to exercise traditional governance based on traditional ecological knowledge, devolved and dynamic access rights, judicious use, equitable distribution of benefits 
Agreements and Finance: Since AR5, global agreements were reached on climate change, sustainable development goals, and the mobilisation of finance for development and climate action. Several countries adopted policies and commitments to restore degraded land 
Companies have also made pledges to reduce impacts on forests and on the rights of local communities as well as eliminating deforestation from their supply chains. The finance sector, a crucial driver behind action (Section 7.6, Box 7.12), has also started to make explicit commitments to avoiding environmental damage 

## Assessment of AFOLU Mitigation Measures Including Tradeoffs and Synergies ##
AFOLU mitigation or land-based climate change mitigation (used in this chapter interchangeably) are a variety of land management or demand management practices that reduce GHG emissions and/or enhance carbon sequestration within the land system (i.e., in forests, wetlands, grasslands, croplands and pasturelands). If implemented with benefits to human well-being and biodiversity, land-based mitigation measures are often referred to as nature-based solutions and/or natural climate solutions (Glossary). Measures that result in a net removal of GHGs from the atmosphere and storage in either living or dead organic material, or in geological stores, are known as CDR, and in previous IPCC reports were sometimes referred to as greenhouse gas removal (GGR) or negative emissions technologies (NETs) 
• A description of activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers. • A summary of conclusions in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) and IPCC Special Reports (Special Report on Climate Change of 1.5°C (SR1.5), Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) and Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL)). • An overview of literature and developments since the AR5 and IPCC Special Reports. • An assessment and conclusion based on current evidence.
Measures are categorised as supply-side activities in: (i) forests and other ecosystems (Section 7.4.2); (ii) agriculture (Section 7.4.3); (iii) bioenergy and other land-based energy technologies (Section 7.4.4); as well as (iv) demand-side activities (Section 7.4.5 and Figure 

## 7.4.1 ##
Introduction Two main approaches to estimating mitigation potentials include: (i) studies on individual measures and/or sectors -henceforth referred to as sectoral assessments, and (ii) integrated assessment models (IAM). Sectoral assessments include studies focusing on one activity (e.g., agroforestry) based on spatial and biophysical data, as well as econometric and optimisation models for a sector, for example, the forest or agriculture sector, and therefore cover a large suite of practices and activities while representing a broad body of literature. Sectoral assessments, however, rarely capture cross-sector interactions or impacts, making it difficult to completely account for land competition, trade-offs, and double counting when aggregating sectoral estimates across different studies and methods 
For the 20 land-based mitigation measures outlined in this section, the mitigation potential estimates are largely derived from sectoral approaches, and where data is available, are compared to IAM estimates. Integrated assessment models and the emissions trajectories, cost-effectiveness and trade-offs of various mitigation pathways are detailed in Section 7.5. It should be noted that the underlying literature for sectoral as well as IAM mitigation estimates consider GWP100 IPCC AR5 values (CH 4 = 28, N 2 O = 265) as well as GWP100 IPCC AR4 values (CH 4 = 25, N 2 O = 298) to convert CH 4 and N 2 O to CO 2 -eq. Where possible, we note the various GWP100
values (in IAM estimates, and the wetlands and agriculture sections), however in some instances, the varying GWP100 values used across studies prevents description of non-CO 2 gases in native units as well as conversion to AR6 GWP100 (CH 4 = 27, N 2 O = 273) CO 2 -eq values to aggregate sectoral assessment estimates.

## Co-benefits and Risks ##
Land interventions have interlinked implications for climate mitigation, adaptation, food security, biodiversity, ecosystem services, and other environmental and societal challenges (Section 7.6.5). Therefore, it is important to consider the net effect of mitigation measures for achieving both climate and non-climate goals (Section 7.1).
While it is helpful to assess the general benefits, risks and opportunities possible for land-based mitigation measures (L.G. 
Overall, measures in the AFOLU sector are uniquely positioned to deliver substantial co-benefits. However, the negative consequences of inappropriate or misguided design and implementation of measures may be considerable, potentially impacting for example, mitigation permanence, longevity, and leakage, biodiversity, wider ecosystem functioning, livelihoods, food security and human wellbeing (Section 7.6) (AR6 WGII, Box 2.2). Land-based mitigation may also face limitations and trade-offs in achieving sustained emission reductions and/or removals due to other land challenges including climate change impacts. It is widely recognised that landuse planning that is context-specific, considers other sustainable development goals, and is adaptable over time can help achieve land-based mitigation that maximises co-benefits, avoids or limits trade-offs, and delivers on international policy goals including the SDGs, Land Degradation Neutrality, and Convention on Biological Diversity (Section 7.6; Chapter 12).
Potential co-benefits and trade-offs are outlined for each of the 20 land-based mitigation measures in the proceeding sub-sections and summarised in Figure 

## Overview of Global and Regional Technical and Economic Potentials in AFOLU ##
IPCC AR5 (2014). In the AR5, the economic mitigation potential of supply-side measures in the AFOLU sector was estimated at 7.18-10.60 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 in 2030 with carbon prices up to USD100 tCO 2 -eq -1 , about a third of which could be achieved at <USD20 tCO 2 -eq -1 (medium evidence, medium agreement) 

## IPCC SRCCL (2019). ##
The SRCCL assessed the full range of technical, economic and sustainability mitigation potentials in AFOLU for the period 2030-2050 and identified reduced deforestation and forest degradation to have greatest potential for reducing supply-side emissions (0.4 to 5.8 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 ) (high confidence) followed by combined agriculture measures, 0.3 to 3.4 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 (medium confidence) 
IPCC AR6. This assessment concludes the likely range of global landbased mitigation potential is approximately 8-14 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 between 2020-2050 with carbon prices up to USD100 tCO 2 -eq -1 , about half of the technical potential (medium evidence, medium agreement). About 30-50% could be achieved <USD20 tCO 2 -eq -1 (Table 
Estimates on costs, feasibility, sustainability, benefits, and risks have also been developed for some mitigation measures, and they continue to be active areas of research. Developing more refined sustainable potentials at a country-level will be an important next step. Although most mitigation estimates still do not consider the impact of future climate change, there are some emerging studies that do 
Across global sectoral studies, the economic mitigation potential (up to USD100 tCO 2 -eq -1 ) of supply-side measures in AFOLU for the period 2020-2050 is 11.4 mean (5.6-19.8 full range) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 , about 50% of the technical potential of 24.2 (4.9-58) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 (Table

Among the mitigation options, the protection, improved management, and restoration of forests and other ecosystems (wetlands, savannas and grasslands) have the largest potential to reduce emissions and/or sequester carbon at 7.3 (3.9-13.1) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 (up to USD100 tCO 2 -eq -1 ), with measures that 'protect' having the single highest total mitigation and mitigation densities (mitigation per area) in AFOLU 
Most mitigation options are available and ready to deploy. Emissions reductions can be unlocked relatively quickly, whereas CDR need upfront investment to generate sequestration over time. The protection of natural ecosystems, carbon sequestration in agriculture, sustainable healthy diets and reduced food waste have especially high co-benefits and cost efficiency. Avoiding the conversion of carbon-rich primary peatlands, coastal wetlands and forests is particularly important as most carbon lost from those ecosystems are irrecoverable through restoration by the 2050 timeline of achieving net zero carbon emissions 
Regionally, economic mitigation potential up to USD100 tCO 2 -eq -1 is estimated to be greatest in tropical countries in Asia and Pacific (34%), Latin America and the Caribbean (24%), and Africa and the Middle East (18%) because of the large potential from reducing deforestation and sequestering carbon in forests and agriculture 
Although economic potentials provide more realistic, near-term climate mitigation compared to technical potentials, they still do not account for feasibility barriers and enabling conditions that vary by region and country. For example, according to most models, including IAMs, avoided deforestation is the cheapest land-based mitigation option (Table 
.11 | Global and regional mitigation potential (GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 ) in 2020-2050 for 20 land-based measures.

## Forests and Other Ecosystems ##


## Reduce Deforestation and Degradation ##
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers. Reducing deforestation and forest degradation conserves existing carbon pools in forest vegetation and soil by avoiding tree cover loss and disturbance. Protecting forests involves controlling the drivers of deforestation (such as commercial and subsistence agriculture, mining, urban expansion) and forest degradation (such as overharvesting including fuelwood collection, poor harvesting practices, overgrazing, pest outbreaks, and extreme wildfires), as well as by establishing well designed, managed and funded protected areas 
Figure 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. Reducing deforestation and forest degradation represents one of the most effective options for climate change mitigation, with technical potential estimated at 0.4-5.8 GtCO 2 yr -1 by 2050 (high confidence) (SRCCL, Chapters 2 and 4, and Table 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). Since the SRCCL, several studies have provided updated and convergent estimates of economic mitigation potentials by region 
) followed by South-East Asia (2.2 GtCO 2 yr -1 technical, 1.5 GtCO 2 yr -1 at USD100 tCO 2 -1
) and Africa (2.2 GtCO 2 yr -1 technical, 1.2 GtCO 2 yr -1 at USD100 tCO 2 -1 ) 
A major uncertainty in all studies on avoided deforestation potential is their reliance on future reference levels that vary across studies and approaches. If food demand increases in the future, for example, the area of land deforested will likely increase, suggesting more technical potential for avoiding deforestation. Transboundary leakage due to market adjustments could also increase costs or reduce effectiveness of avoiding deforestation (e.g., 

## Critical assessment and conclusion. ##
Based on studies since AR5, the technical mitigation potential for reducing deforestation and degradation is significant, providing 4.5 (2.3-7) GtCO 2 yr -1 globally by 2050, of which 3.4 (2.3-6.4) GtCO 2 yr -1 is available at below USD100 tCO 2 -1 (medium confidence) (Figure 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. The AR5 did not provide a new specification of A/R potential, but referred to IPCC AR4 mostly for forestry measures 
The SRCCL remained with a reported wide range of mitigation potential for A/R of 0.5-10. , 1.6 GtCO 2 yr -1 could be sequestered globally for an annual cost of USD130 billion 

## Critical assessment and conclusion. ##
There is medium confidence that the global technical mitigation potential of afforestation and reforestation activities by 2050 is 3.9 (0.5-10.1) GtCO 2 yr -1 , and the economic mitigation potential (<USD100 tCO 2 - 

## Improved Forest Management ##
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers. Improved sustainable forest management of already managed forests can lead to higher forest carbon stocks, better quality of produced wood, continuously produced wood, while maintaining and enhancing the forest carbon stock, and can also partially prevent and counteract the impacts of disturbances 
Generally, measures can consist of one or combination of longer rotations, less intensive harvests, continuous-cover forestry, mixed stands, more adapted species, selected provenances, high quality wood assortments, and so on. Further, there is a trade-off between management in various parts of the forest product value chain, resulting in a wide range of results on the role of managed forests in mitigation 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. In the SRCCL, forest management activities have the potential to mitigate 0.4-2.1 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 by 2050 (medium confidence) (SRCCL: 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). The area of forest under management plans has increased in all regions since 2000 by 233 Mha (FAO 2020e). The roughly 1 billion ha of secondary and degraded forests would be ideal to invest in and develop a sustainable sector that pays attention to biodiversity, wood provision and climate mitigation at the same time. This all depends on the effort made, the development of expertise, know-how in the field, nurseries with adapted provenances, etc as was also found for Russian climate-smart forestry options 
Regional studies can take into account the local situation better: Russia 
. In one production region (British Columbia) a cost-effective portfolio of scenarios was simulated that directed more of the harvested wood to longer-lived wood products, stopped burning of harvest residues and instead produced bioenergy to displace fossil fuel burning, and reduced harvest levels in regions with low disturbance rates. Net GHG emissions were reduced by an average of -9 MtCO 2 -eq yr -1 
In the tropics, estimates of the pantropical climate mitigation potential of natural forest management (a light intensity management in secondary forests), across three tropical regions (Latin America, Africa, Asia), is around 0.66 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 with Asia responding for the largest share followed by Africa and Latin America 

## Critical assessment and conclusion. ##
There is medium confidence that the global technical mitigation potential for improved forest management by 2050 is 1.7 (1-2.1) GtCO 2 yr -1 , and the economic mitigation potential (<USD100 tCO 2 - 

## Box 7.2 | Climate-smart Forestry in Europe Summary ##
European forests have been regarded as prospering and increasing for the last five decades. However, these views also changed recently. Climate change is putting a large pressure on mono species and high stocked areas of Norway spruce in Central Europe 

## Background ##
The idea behind CSF is that it considers the whole value chain from forest to wood products and energy, illustrating that a wide range of measures can be applied to provide positive incentives for more firmly integrating climate objectives into the forest and forest sector framework. CSF is more than just storing carbon in forest ecosystems; it builds upon three main objectives; (i) reducing and/ or removing GHG emissions; (ii) adapting and building diverse forests for forest resilience to climate change; and (iii) sustainably increasing forest productivity and incomes. These three CSF objectives can be achieved by tailoring policy measures and actions to regional circumstances in member states' forest sectors. 

## Case description ##
The 2015 annual mitigation effect of EU-28 forests via contributions to the forest sink, material substitution and energy substitution is estimated at 569 MtCO 2 yr -1 , or 13% of total current EU emissions. With the right set of incentives in place at EU and member states levels, it was found that the EU-28 has the potential to achieve an additional combined mitigation impact through the implementation of CSF of 441 MtCO 2 yr -1 by 2050. Also, with the Green Deal and its biodiversity and forest strategy, more emphasis will be placed on forests, forest management and the provision of renewables. It is the diversity of measures (from strict reserves to more intensively managed systems while adapting the resource) that will determine the success. Only with co-benefits in, for example, nature conservation, soil protection, and provision of renewables, wood for buildings and income, the mitigation and adaptation measures will be successful. ecological reasons 

## Interactions, limitations and lessons ##


## Critical assessment and conclusion. ##
There is low confidence that the global technical mitigation potential for grassland and savanna fire management by 2050 is 0.1 (0.09-0.1) GtCO 2 yr -1 , and the economic mitigation potential (<USD100 tCO 2 -1
) is 0.05 (0.03-0.07) GtCO 2 yr -1 . Savanna fires produce significant emissions globally, but prescribed fires in the early dry season could mitigate emissions in different regions, particularly Africa. Evidence is less clear for fire management of forests, with the contribution of GHG mitigation depending on many factors that affect the carbon balance (e.g., 

## Reduce Degradation and Conversion of Grasslands and Savannas ##
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers. Grasslands cover approximately 40.5% of the terrestrial area (i.e., 52.5 million km 2 ) divided as 13.8% woody savanna and savanna; 12.7% open and closed shrub; 8.3% nonwoody grassland; and 5.7% is tundra 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. The SRCCL reported a mitigation potential for reduced conversion of grasslands and savannas of 0.03-0.12 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). Unlike most of the measures covered in Section 7.4, there are currently no global, spatially explicit mitigation potential estimates for reduced grassland conversion to generate technical and economic potentials by region. Literature developments since AR5 and SRCCL are studies that provide mitigation estimates in one or a few countries or regions. Modelling experiments comparing Californian forests and grasslands found that grasslands resulted in a more resilient carbon sink than forests to future climate change 

## Critical assessment and conclusion. ##
There is low confidence that the global technical mitigation potential for reduced grassland and savanna conversion by 2050 is 0.2 (0.1-0.4) GtCO 2 yr -1 , and the economic mitigation potential (<USD100 tCO 2 -1
) is 0.04 GtCO 2 yr -1 . Most of the carbon sequestration potential is in below-ground biomass and soil organic matter. However, estimates of potential are still based on few studies and vary according to the levels of soil carbon, and ecosystem productivity (e.g., in response to rainfall distribution). Conservation of grasslands presents significant benefits for desertification control, especially in arid areas (SRCCL, Chapter 3). Policies supporting avoided conversion can help protect at-risk grasslands, reduce GHG emissions, and produce positive outcomes for biodiversity and landowners 

## Reduce Degradation and Conversion ##
of Peatlands Activities, Co-benefits, Risks and Implementation Barriers
Peatlands are carbon-rich wetland ecosystems with organic soil horizons in which soil organic matter concentration exceeds 30% (dry weight) and soil carbon concentrations can exceed 50% (Page and Baird 2016, Boone 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. In the SRCCL (Chapters 2 and 6), it was estimated that avoided peat impacts could deliver 0.45-1.22 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 technical potential by 2030-2050 (medium confidence) 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). Recent studies continue to report high carbon stocks in peatlands and emphasise the vulnerability of peatland carbon after conversion. The carbon stocks of tropical peatlands are among the highest of any forest, 1,211-4,257 tCO 2 -eq ha -1 in the Peruvian Amazon 

## Critical assessment and conclusion. ##
Based on studies to date, there is medium confidence that peatland conservation has a technical potential of 0.86 (0.43-2.02) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 of which 0.48 (0.2-0.68) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 is available at USD100 tCO 2 -1 

## Peatland Restoration ##
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation barriers. Peatland restoration involves restoring degraded and damaged peatlands, for example through rewetting and revegetation, which both increases carbon accumulation in vegetation and soils and avoids ongoing CO 2 emissions. Peatlands only account for about 3% of the terrestrial surface, predominantly occurring in boreal ecosystems (78%), with a smaller proportion in tropical regions (13%), but may store about 600 GtC or 21% of the global total soil organic carbon stock of about 3000 Gt 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. Large areas (0.51 Mkm 2 ) of global peatlands are degraded of which 0.2 Mkm 2 are tropical peatlands 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). The most recent literature and reviews indicate with high confidence that restoration would decrease CO 2 emissions and with medium confidence that restoration would decrease net GHG emissions from degraded peatlands 
According to recent data, the technical mitigation potential for global peatland restoration is estimated at 0.5-1.3 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 
Climate mitigation effects of peatland rewetting depend on the climate zone and land use. Recent analysis shows the strongest mitigation gains from rewetting drained temperate and boreal peatlands used for agriculture and drained tropical peatlands 

## Critical assessment and conclusion. ##
Based on studies to date, there is medium confidence that peatland restoration has a technical potential of 0.79 (0.49-1.3) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 (median) of which 0.4 (0.2-0.6) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 is available up to USD100 tCO 2 -1
. The large land area of degraded peatlands suggests that significant emissions reductions could occur through large-scale restoration especially in tropical peatlands. There is medium confidence in the large carbon stocks of tropical peat forests (1956-14,757 tCO 2 -eq ha -1 ) and large rates of carbon loss associated with land cover change (640-1650 tCO 2 -eq ha -1 ) 

## Reduce Conversion of Coastal Wetlands ##
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation barriers. Reducing conversion of coastal wetlands, including mangroves, marshes and seagrass ecosystems, avoids emissions from above and below ground biomass and soil carbon through avoided degradation and/or loss. Coastal wetlands occur mainly in estuaries and deltas, areas that are often densely settled, with livelihoods closely linked to coastal ecosystems and resources 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. Coastal wetlands contain high, yet variable, organic carbon stocks, leading to a range of estimates of the global mitigation potential of reduced conversion. The SRCCL (Chapter 2) and SROCC (Chapter 5), report a technical mitigation potential of 0.15-5.35 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 by 2050 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). Global technical mitigation potential for conservation of coastal wetlands from recent literature have focused on protection of mangroves; estimates range from 0.06-2.25 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 
Global estimates show mangroves have the largest per hectare carbon stocks (see IPCC AR6 WGII Box 3.4 for estimates of carbon stocks, burial rates and ecosystem extent for coastal wetland ecosystems). Mean ecosystem carbon stock in mangroves is 3131 tCO 2 -eq ha -1  among the largest carbon stocks on Earth. Recent studies emphasise the variability in total ecosystem carbon stocks for each wetland type, based on species and climatic and edaphic conditions 
Recent loss rates of mangroves are 0.16-0.39% yr -1 and are highest in South-East Asia 
), 10% is in Latin American and the Caribbean (4 MtCO 2 -eq yr -1 ), and approximately 5% in other regions 
Key uncertainties remain in mapping extent and conversion rates for salt marshes and seagrasses 

## Critical assessment and conclusion. ##
There is medium confidence that coastal wetland protection has a technical potential of 0.8 (0.06-5.4) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 of which 0.17 (0.06-0.27) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 is available up to USD100 tCO 2 -1
. There is a high certainty (robust evidence, high agreement) that coastal ecosystems have among the largest carbon stocks of any ecosystem. As these ecosystems provide many important services, reduced conversion of coastal wetlands is a valuable mitigation strategy with numerous co-benefits. However, the vulnerability of coastal wetlands to climatic and other anthropogenic stressors may limit the permanence of climate mitigation.

## Coastal Wetland Restoration ##
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation barriers. Coastal wetland restoration involves restoring degraded or damaged coastal wetlands including mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass ecosystems, leading to sequestration of 'blue carbon' in wetland vegetation and soil (SRCCL, Chapter 6; SROCC, Chapter 5). Successful approaches to wetland restoration include: (i) passive restoration, the removal of anthropogenic activities that are causing degradation or preventing recovery; and (ii) active restoration, purposeful manipulations to the environment in order to achieve recovery to a naturally functioning system 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. The SRCCL reported that mangrove restoration has the technical potential to mitigate 0.07 GtCO 2 yr -1 through rewetting 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). Recent studies emphasise the time frame needed to achieve the full mitigation potential 
According to recent data, the technical mitigation potential for global coastal wetland restoration is 0.04-0.84 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 
) potential of mangrove restoration; seagrass and marsh restoration was not included due to lack of country-level data on distribution and conversion (but see 
There is high site-specific variation in carbon sequestration rates and uncertainties regarding the response to future climate change 

## Critical assessment and conclusion. ##
There is medium confidence that coastal wetland restoration has a technical potential of 0.3 (0.04-0.84) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 of which 0.1 (0.05-0.2) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 is available up to USD100 tCO 2 -1
. There is high confidence that coastal wetlands, especially mangroves, contain large carbon stocks relative to other ecosystems and medium confidence that restoration will reinstate pre-disturbance carbon sequestration rates. There is low confidence on the response of coastal wetlands to climate change; however, there is high confidence that coastal wetland restoration will provide a suite of valuable co-benefits.  
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). No recent literature has been published which conflict with the mitigation potentials reported in the SRCCL. Relevant papers include 
) potential between 2020 and 2050 for croplands to be in Asia and the Pacific (339.7 MtCO 2 yr -1 ) and for grasslands, in Developed Countries (253.6 MtCO 2 yr -1 ).
Critical assessment and conclusion. In conclusion, there is medium confidence that enhanced soil carbon management in croplands has a global technical mitigation potential of 1.9 (0.4-6.8) GtCO 2 yr -1 , and in grasslands of 1.0 (0.2-2.6) GtCO 2 yr -1 , of which, 0.6 (04-0.9) and 0.9 (0.3-1.6) GtCO 2 yr -1 is estimated to be available at up to USD100 tCO 2 -1 respectively. Regionally, soil carbon management in croplands and grasslands is feasible anywhere, but effectiveness can be limited in very dry regions, and for grasslands it is greatest in areas where degradation has occurred (e.g., by overgrazing) and soil organic carbon is depleted. Barriers to implementation include regional capacity for monitoring and verification (especially in developing countries), and more widely through concerns over saturation and permanence.

## Biochar ##
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers. Biochar is produced by heating organic matter in oxygen-limited environments (pyrolysis and gasification) 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. Biochar is discussed as a mitigation option in AR5 and CDR strategy in the SR1.5. Consideration of potential was limited as biochar is not included in IAMs. The SRCCL estimated mitigation potential of 0.03-6.6 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 by 2050 based on studies with widely varying assumptions, definitions of potential, and scope of mitigation processes included (SRCCL, Chapters 2 and 4: 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). Developments include mechanistic understanding of 'negative priming' and biochar-soil-microbes-plant interactions 
) between 2020 and 2050 to be in Asia and the Pacific (793 MtCO 2 yr -1 ) followed by Developed Countries (447 MtCO 2 yr -1 ) 
Critical assessment and conclusion. Biochar has significant mitigation potential through CDR and emissions reduction, and can also improve soil properties, enhancing productivity and resilience to climate change (medium agreement, robust evidence). There is medium evidence that biochar has a technical potential of 2.6 (0.2-6.6) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 , of which 1.1 (0.3-1.8) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 is available up to USD100 tCO 2 -1 . However, mitigation and agronomic co-benefits depend strongly on biochar properties and the soil to which biochar is applied (strong agreement, robust evidence). While biochar could provide moderate to large mitigation potential, it is not yet included in IAMs, which has restricted comparison and integration with other CDR strategies.

## Agroforestry ##
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers. Agroforestry is a set of diverse land management systems that integrate trees and shrubs with crops and/or livestock in space and/or time. Agroforestry accumulates carbon in woody vegetation and soil 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. The SRCCL estimated the global technical mitigation potential of agroforestry, with medium confidence, to be between 0.08 and 5.6 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 by 2050 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). Updated estimates of agroforestry's technical mitigation potential and synthesised estimates of carbon sequestration across agroforestry systems have since been published. The most recent global analysis estimates technical potential of 9.4 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 
Regional estimates of mitigation potential are scant with agroforestry options differing significantly by geography 
Recent research has also highlighted co-benefits and more precisely identified implementation barriers. In addition to aforementioned co-benefits, evidence now shows that agroforestry can improve soil health, regarding infiltration and structural stability 

## Critical assessment and conclusion. ##
There is medium confidence that agroforestry has a technical potential of 4.1 (0.3-9.4) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 for the period 2020-2050, of which 0.8 (0.4-1.1) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 is available at USD100 tCO 2 -1
. Despite uncertainty around global estimates due to regional preferences for management systems, suitable land availability, and growing conditions, there is high confidence in agroforestry's mitigation potential at the field scale. With countless options for farmers and land managers to implement agroforestry, there is medium confidence in the feasibility of achieving estimated regional mitigation potential. Appropriately matching agroforestry options, to local biophysical and social contexts is important in maximising mitigation and cobenefits, while avoiding risks (Sinclair and Coe 2019).

## Box 7.3 | Case Study: Agroforestry in Brazil -CANOPIES Summary ##
Brazilian farmers are integrating trees into their croplands in various ways, ranging from simple to highly complex agroforestry systems. While complex systems are more effective in the mitigation of climate change, trade-offs with scalability need to be resolved for agroforestry systems to deliver on their potential. The Brazilian-Dutch CANOPIES project 

## Background ##
The climate change mitigation potential of agroforestry systems is widely recognised 

## Case description ##
These synergies and trade-offs between complexity, multifunctionality and scalability are studied in the CANOPIES (Co-existence of Agriculture and Nature: Optimisation and Planning of Integrated Ecosystem Services) project, a collaboration between Wageningen University (NL), the University of São Paulo and EMBRAPA (both Brazil). Soil and management data are collected on farms of varying complexity to evaluate carbon sequestration and other ecosystem services, economic performance and labour demands.

## Interactions and limitations ##
The trade-off between complexity and labour demand is less pronounced in EMBRAPA's integrated crop-livestock-forestry (ICLF) systems, where grains and pasture are planted between widely spaced tree rows. Here, barriers for implementation relate mostly to livestock and grain farmers' lack of knowledge on forestry management and financing mechanisms 5 

## Enteric Fermentation ##
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers. Mitigating CH 4 emissions from enteric fermentation can be direct (i.e., targeting ruminal methanogenesis and emissions per animal or unit of feed consumed) or indirect, by increasing production efficiency (i.e., reducing emission intensity per unit of product). Measures can be classified as those relating to (i) feeding, (ii) supplements, additives and vaccines, and (iii) livestock breeding and wider husbandry 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. The AR5 indicated medium (5-15%) technical mitigation potential from both feeding and breeding related measures 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). Recent reviews generally identify the same measures as those outlined in the SRCCL, with the addition of early life manipulation of the ruminal biome 
Approaches differ regionally, with more focus on direct, technical options in Developed Countries, and improved efficiency in developing countries 

## Box 7.3 (continued) ##


## Lessons ##
Successful examples of how more complex agroforestry can be upscaled do exist in Brazil. For example, on farm trials and consistent investments over several years have enabled Rizoma Agro to develop a citrus production system that integrates commercial and native trees in a large-scale multi-layered agroforestry system. The success of their transition resulted in part from their corporate structure that allowed them to tap into the certified Green Bonds market (CBI 2020). However, different transition strategies need to be developed for family farmers and their distinct socio-economic conditions.
Critical review and conclusion. Based on studies to date, using a range of IPCC GWP100 values for CH 4 , there is medium confidence that activities to reduce enteric CH 4 emissions have a global technical potential of 0.8 (0.2-1.2) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 , of which 0.2 (0.1-0.3) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 is available up to USD100 tCO 2 -eq -1 (Figure 

## Improve Rice Management ##
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers. Emissions from rice cultivation mainly concern CH 4 associated with anaerobic conditions, although N 2 O emission also occur via nitrification and denitrification processes. Measures to reduce CH 4 and N 2 O emissions include (i) improved water management (e.g., single drainage and multiple drainage practices), (ii) improved residue management, (iii) improved fertiliser application (e.g., using slow release fertiliser and nutrient specific application), and (iv) soil amendments (including biochar and organic amendments) 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. The AR5 outlined emissions from rice cultivation of 0.49-0.723 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 in 2010 with an average annual growth of 0.4% yr -1 . The SRCCL estimated a global mitigation potential from improved rice cultivation of 0.08-0.87 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 between 2020 and 2050, with the range representing the difference between technical and economic constraints, types of activities included (e.g., improved water management and straw residue management) and GHGs considered 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). Since AR5 and the SRCCL, studies on mitigation have principally focused on water and nutrient management practices with the aim of improving overall sustainability as well as measurements of site-specific emissions to help improve the resolution of regional estimates. Intensity of emissions show considerable spatial and temporal variation, dependent on site specific factors including degradation of soil organic matter, management of water levels in the field, the types and amount of fertilisers applied, rice variety and local cultivation practices. Variation in CH 4 emissions have been found to range from 0.5-41.8 mg m 2 hr -1 in South-East Asia 
Recent studies on water management have highlighted the potential to mitigate GHG emissions, while also enhancing water use efficiency 

## Critical assessment and conclusion. ##
There is medium confidence that improved rice management has a technical potential of 0.3 (0.1-0.8) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 between 2020 and 2050, of which 0.2 (0.05-0.3) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 is available up to USD100 tCO 2 -eq -1 (Figure 

## Crop Nutrient Management ##
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers. Improved crop nutrient management can reduce N 2 O emissions from cropland soils. Practices include optimising fertiliser application delivery, rates and timing, utilising different fertiliser types (i.e., organic manures, composts and synthetic forms), and using slow or controlled-released fertilisers or nitrification inhibitors 
A potential risk under certain circumstances, is yield reduction, while implementation of practices should consider current soil nutrient status. There are significant regional imbalances, with some regions experiencing nutrient surpluses from over fertilisation and others, nutrient shortages and chronic deficiencies (FAO 2021e). Additionally, depending on context, practices may be inaccessible, expensive or require expertise to implement 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. The SRCCL broadly identified the same practices as outlined in AR5 and estimated that improved cropland nutrient management could mitigate between 0.03 and 0.71 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 between 2020 and 2050 (SRCCL Chapter 2) 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). Research since the SRCCL highlights the mitigation potential and co-benefits of adopting improved nutrient management strategies, notably precision fertiliser application methods and nutrient expert systems, and applicability in both large-scale mechanised and small-scale systems (USEPA 2019; 

## Critical assessment and conclusion. ##
There is medium confidence that crop nutrient management has a technical potential of 0.3 (0.06-0.7) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 of which 0.2 (0.05-0.6) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 is available up to USD100 tCO 2 -eq -1 . This value is based on GWP100 using a mixture of IPCC values for N 2 O and may slightly differ if calculated using AR6 values. The development of national roadmaps for sustainable fertiliser (nutrient) management can help in scalingup related practices and in realising this potential. Crop nutrient management measures can contribute not only to mitigation, but food and nutrition security and wider environmental sustainability goals.

## Box 7.4 | Case Study: The Climate-smart Village Approach Summary ##
The climate-smart villages (CSV) approach aims to generate local knowledge, with the involvement of farmers, researchers, practitioners, and governments, on climate change adaptation and mitigation while improving productivity, food security, and farmers' livelihoods 

## Background ##
It is expected that agricultural production systems across the world will change in response to climate change, posing significant challenges to the livelihoods and food security of millions of people 

## Case description ##
The CSV approach seeks an integrated vision so that sustainable rural development is the final goal for rural communities. At the same time, it fosters the understanding of climate change with the implementation of adaptation and mitigation actions, as much as possible. Rural communities and local stakeholders are the leaders of this process, where scientists facilitate their knowledge to be useful for the communities and learn at the same time about challenges but also the capacity those communities have built through time. The portfolio includes weather-smart activities, water-smart practices, seed/breed smart, carbon-/nutrient-smart practices, and institutional-/market-smart activities.

## Interactions and limitations ##
The integration of technologies and services that are suitable for the local conditions resulted in many gains for food security and adaptation and for mitigation where appropriate. It was also shown that, in all regions, there is considerable yield advantage when a portfolio of technologies is used, rather than the isolated use of technologies 

## Lessons ##
i. Understanding the priorities, context, challenges, capacity, and characteristics of the territory and the communities regarding climate, as well as the environmental and socio-economic dimensions, is the first step. Then, understanding climate vulnerability in their agricultural systems based on scientific data but also listening to their experience will set the pathway to identify climatesmart agriculture (CSA) options (practices and technologies) to reduce such vulnerability. ii. Building capacity is also a critical element of the CSV approach, rural families learn about the practices and technologies in a neighbour's house, and as part of the process, families commit to sharing their knowledge with other families, to start a scalingout process within the communities. Understanding the relationship between climate and their crop is key, as well as the use of weather forecasts to plan their agricultural activities.
The assessment of the implementation of the CSA options should be done together with community leaders to understand changes in livelihoods and climate vulnerability. Also, knowledge appropriation by community leaders has led to farmer-to-farmer knowledge exchange within and outside the community (Ortega Fernandez and Martínez-Barón 2018). ) of economic potential (up to USD100 tCO 2 -eq -1 ) between 2020-2050, to be in Developed Countries 

## Manure Management ##


## Introduction ##
There is robust evidence and high agreement that agriculture needs to change to facilitate environment conservation while maintaining and where appropriate, increase overall production. The SRCCL identified several farming system approaches, deemed alternative to conventional systems 

## Agroecology (AE) including Regenerative Agriculture (RA) ##
There is limited discussion on the mitigation potential of AE 
Like AE, it is likely that RA can contribute to mitigation, the extent to which is currently unclear and by its case-specific design, will vary (medium confidence).
Conservation agriculture (CA)
The SRCCL noted both positive and inconclusive results regarding CA and soil carbon, with sustained sequestration dependent on productivity and residue returns 

## Integrated production systems (IPS) ##
The integration of different enterprises in space and time (e.g., diversified cropping, crop and livestock production, agroforestry), therefore facilitating interaction and transfer of recourses between systems, is suggested to enhance sustainability and adaptive capacity 

## Organic farming (OF) ##
OF can be considered a form of AE 

## Box 7.6 | Case Study: Mitigation Options and Costs in the Indian Agricultural Sector Objective ##
To assess the technical mitigation potentials of Indian agriculture and costs under a business as usual scenario (BAU) and Mitigation scenario up to 2030 

## Results ##
The study shows that by 2030 under BAU scenario GHG emissions from the agricultural sector in India would be 515 MtCO 2 -eq yr -1 (using GWP100 and IPCC AR4 values) with a technical mitigation potential of 85.5 MtCO 2 -eq yr -1 through the adoption of various mitigation practices. About 80% of the technical mitigation potential could be achieved by adopting cost-saving measures. Three mitigation options, for example, efficient use of fertiliser, zero-tillage, and rice-water management, could deliver more than 50% of the total technical abatement potential. Under the BAU scenario the projected GHG emissions from major crop and livestock species is estimated at 489 MtCO 2 -eq in 2030, whereas under mitigation scenario GHG emissions are estimated at 410 MtCO 2 -eq implying a technical mitigation option of about 78.67 MtCO 2 -eq yr -1 (Box 7.6, Figure 
Sapkota et al. ( 

## Bioenergy and BECCS ##
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers. Bioenergy refers to energy products (solid, liquid and gaseous fuels, electricity, heat) derived from multiple biomass sources including organic waste, harvest residues and by-flows in the agriculture and forestry sectors, and biomass from tree plantations, agroforestry systems, lignocellulosic crops, and conventional food/feed crops. It may reduce net GHG emissions by displacing the use of coal, oil and natural gas with renewable biomass in the production of heat, electricity, and fuels. When combined with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and biochar production, bioenergy systems may provide CDR by durably storing biogenic carbon in geological, terrestrial, or ocean reservoirs, or in products, further contributing to mitigation 
Modern bioenergy systems (as opposed to traditional use of fuelwood and other low-quality cooking and heating fuels) currently provide approximately 30 EJ yr -1 of primary energy, making up 53% of total renewable primary energy supply (IEA 2019). Bioenergy systems are commonly integrated within forest and agriculture systems that produce food, feed, lumber, paper and other bio-based products. They can also be combined with other AFOLU mitigation options: deployment of energy crops, agroforestry and A/R can provide biomass while increasing land carbon stocks 
Bioenergy and BECCS can be associated with a range of co-benefits and adverse side effects 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. Many more stringent mitigation scenarios in AR5 relied heavily on bioenergy and BECCS. The SR1.5 reported a range for the CDR potential of BECCS (2100) at 0.5 to 5 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 when applying constraints reflecting sustainability concerns, at a cost of 100-200 USD tCO 2 -1 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). The role of bioenergy and BECCS in mitigation pathways has been reduced as IAM-based studies have incorporated broader mitigation portfolios and have explored non-CO 2 emissions reduction and a wider variation of underlying assumptions about socio-economic drivers and associated energy and food demand, as well as deployment limits such as land availability for A/R and for cultivation of crops used for bioenergy and BECCS 
Increased availability of spatially explicit data and advances in the modelling of crop productivity and land use, land carbon stocks, hydrology, and ecosystem properties, have enabled more comprehensive analyses of factors that influence the contribution of bioenergy and BECCS in IAM-based mitigation scenarios, and also associated co-benefits and adverse side effects 
Studies have also investigated the extent and possible use of marginal, abandoned, and degraded lands, and approaches to help restore the productive value of these lands 

## Box 7.7 | Climate Change Mitigation Value of Bioenergy and BECCS ##
Besides emissions, and possible avoided emissions, related to the supply chain, the GHG effects of using bioenergy depend on: (i) change in GHG emissions when bioenergy substitutes another energy source; and (ii) how the associated land use and possible landuse change influence the amount of carbon that is stored in vegetation and 
Box 7.7, Figure 
Box 7.7 (continued)
One curve (EMF-33) is determined from stylised scenarios using IAMs 
The Natural Regrowth curve attribute additional 'counterfactual emissions' to the bioenergy system, corresponding to estimated uptake of CO 2 in a counterfactual scenario where land is not used for bioenergy but instead subject to natural vegetation regrowth. This curve does not show actual emissions from the bioenergy system, but it provides insights in the mitigation value of the bioenergy option compared to alternative land-use strategies. To illustrate, if biomass is used instead of a primary energy source with emission factor 75 kgCO 2 GJ -1 , and the median values in the Natural Regrowth curve are adopted, then the curve indicates that up to about 150 EJ of biomass can be produced and used for energy while achieving higher net GHG savings than the alternative to set aside the same land for natural vegetation regrowth (assuming same conversion factor).
The large ranges in the bars signify the importance of uncertainties and how the biomass is deployed. Variation in energy conversion efficiencies and uncertainty about magnitude, timing, and permanence of land carbon storage further complicate the comparison. Finally, not shown in Box 7.7, Figure 
Critical assessment and conclusion. Recent estimates of technical biomass potentials constrained by food security and environmental considerations fall within previous ranges corresponding to medium agreement, (e.g., 
Technical land availability does not imply that dedicated biomass production for bioenergy and BECCS is the most effective use of this land for mitigation. Further, implications of deployment for climate change mitigation and other sustainability criteria are context dependent and influenced by many factors, including rate and total scale. While governance has a critical influence on outcome, larger scale and higher expansion rate generally translates into higher risk for negative outcomes for GHG emissions, biodiversity, food security and a range of other sustainability criteria 
However, literature has also highlighted how the agriculture and forestry sectors may respond to increasing demand by devising management approaches that enable biomass production for energy in conjunction with supply of food, construction timber, and other bio-based products, providing climate change mitigation while enabling multiple co-benefits including for nature conservation 
Strategies to enhance the benefits of bioenergy and BECCS include (i) management practices that protect carbon stocks and the productive and adaptive capacity of lands, as well as their environmental and social functions

Demand-side Measures

## Shift to Sustainable Healthy Diets ##
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers. The term 'sustainable healthy diets' refers to dietary patterns that 'promote all dimensions of individuals' health and wellbeing; have low environmental pressure and impact; are accessible, affordable, safe and equitable; and are culturally acceptable' (FAO and WHO 2019). In addition to climate mitigation gains, a transition towards more plant-based consumption and reduced consumption of animal-based foods, particularly from ruminant animals, could reduce pressure on forests and land used for feed, support the preservation of biodiversity and planetary health 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. According to the AR5, changes in human diets and consumption patterns can reduce emissions 5.3 to 20.2 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 by 2050 from diverted agricultural production and avoided land-use change 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). Since the SRCCL, global studies continue to find high mitigation potential from reducing animal-source foods and increasing proportions of plant-rich foods in diets. 
Regionally, mitigation potentials for shifting towards sustainable healthy diets (50% convergence to <60g of meat-based protein, only accounting for diverted production) vary across regions. A recent assessment finds greatest economic (up to USD100 tCO 2 - 

## Critical assessment and conclusion. Shifting to sustainable healthy diets has large potential to achieve global GHG mitigation targets as well as public health and environmental benefits (high confidence). ##
Based on studies to date, there is medium confidence that shifting toward sustainable healthy diets has a technical potential including savings in the full value chain of 3.6 (0.3-8.0) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 of which 2.5 (1.5-3.9) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 is considered plausible based on a range of GWP100 values for CH 4 and N 2 O. When accounting for diverted agricultural production only, the feasible potential is 1.7 (1-2.7) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 . A shift to more sustainable and healthy diets is generally feasible in many regions (medium confidence). However, potential varies across regions as diets are location-and community-specific, and thus may be influenced by local production practices, technical and financial barriers and associated livelihoods, everyday life and behavioural and cultural norms around food consumption 

## Reduce Food Loss and Waste ##
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers. Food loss and waste (FLW) refer to the edible parts of plants and animals produced for human consumption that are not ultimately consumed (UNEP 2021b). Food loss occurs through spoilage, spilling or other unintended consequences due to limitations in agricultural infrastructure, storage and packaging 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. In AR5, reduced FLW was considered as a mitigation measure that could substantially lower emissions, with estimated mitigation potential of 0.6-6.0 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 in the food supply chain 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). Since the SRCCL, there have been very few quantitative estimates of the mitigation potential of FLW reductions. Evidence suggests that reducing FLW together with overall food intake could have substantial mitigation potential, equating to an average of 0.3 tCO 2 -eq capita -1 
) for the period 2020-2050 from FLW reduction is estimated to be in 

## Critical assessment and conclusion. ##
There is medium confidence that reduced FLW has large global technical mitigation potential of 2.1 (0.1-5.8) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 including savings in the full value chain and using GWP100 and a range of IPCC values for CH 4 and N 2 O. Potentials at 3.7 (2.2-5.1) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 are considered plausible. When accounting for diverted agricultural production only, the feasible potential is 0.5 (0.0-0.9) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 . See the section above for the joint land-use effects of food related demand-side measures which increases three-fold when accounting for the landuse effects as well. But this would overlap with other measures and is therefore not additive. Regionally, FLW reduction is feasible anywhere but its potential needs to be understood in a wider and changing socio-cultural context that determines nutrition (high confidence).

## Improved and Enhanced Use of Wood Products ##
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers. The use of wood products refers to the fate of harvested wood for material uses and includes two distinctly different components affecting the carbon cycle, including carbon storage in wood products and material substitution. When harvested wood is used for the manufacture of wood products, carbon remains stored in these products depending on their end use and lifetime. Carbon storage in wood products can be increased through enhancing the inflow of products in use, or effectively reducing the outflow of the products after use. This can be achieved through additional harvest under sustainable management 
The benefits and risks of improved and enhanced improved use of wood products are closely linked to forest management. First of all, the enhanced use of wood products could potentially activate or lead to improved sustainable forest management that can mitigate and adapt 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. There is strong evidence at the product level that wood products from sustainably managed forests are associated with less greenhouse emissions in their production, use and disposal over their life-time compared to products made from emission-intensive and nonrenewable materials. However, there is still limited understanding of the substitution effects at the level of markets, countries 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). Since the SRCCL, several studies have examined the mitigation potential of the enhanced and improved use of wood products. A global forest sector modelling study 
The limited availability or absence of estimates of the future mitigation potential of improved use of wood products for many world regions represents an important knowledge gap, especially with regards to material substitution effects. At the product level, wood products are often associated with lower fossil-based emissions from production, use and disposal, compared to products made from emission-intensive and non-renewable materials 

## Critical assessment and conclusion. ##
Based on studies to date, there is strong evidence and medium agreement that the improved use of wood products has a technical potential of 1.0 (0.04-3.7) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 and economic potential of 0.4 (0.3-0.5) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 . There is strong evidence and high agreement at the product level that material substitution provides on average benefits for climate change mitigation as wood products are associated with less fossil-based GHG emissions over their lifetime compared to products made from emission-intensive and non-renewable materials. However, the evidence at the level of markets or countries is uncertain and fairly limited for many parts of the world. There is medium confidence that material substitution and carbon storage in wood products contribute to climate change mitigation when also the carbon balances of forest ecosystems are considered of sustainably managed large areas of forests in medium term. The total future mitigation potential will depend on the forest system considered, the type of wood products that are produced and substituted and the assumed production technologies and conversion efficiencies of these products.

## AFOLU Integrated Models and Scenarios ##
This section assesses the literature and data available on potential future GHG dynamics in the AFOLU sector, the cost-effectiveness of different mitigation measures, and consequences of climate change mitigation pathways on land-use dynamics as well as relevant sustainable development indicators at the regional and global level based on global integrated models.
Land-based mitigation options interact and create various tradeoffs, and thus need to be assessed together as well as with mitigation options in other sectors, and in combination with other sustainability goals 
As a consequence of the relative novelty of land-based mitigation assessment in ILMs and IAMs, the portfolio of land-based mitigation options does not cover the full option space as outlined in Section 7.4. The inclusion and detail of a specific mitigation measure differs across models. Land-based mitigation options are only partially included in ILM and IAM analyses, which mostly rely on afforestation/ reforestation and bioenergy with CCS (BECCS). Most ILM and IAM scenarios are based on the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) 

## Regional GHG Emissions and Land Dynamics ##
In most of the assessed mitigation pathways, the AFOLU sector is of great importance for climate change mitigation as it (i) turns from a source into a sink of atmospheric CO due to large-scale afforestation and reforestation, (ii) provides high amounts of biomass for bioenergy with or without CCS and (iii), even under improved agricultural management, still causes residual non-CO 2 emissions from agricultural production and (iv) interplays with sustainability dimensions other than climate action 
In most regions, CH 4 and N 2 O emission are both lower in mitigation pathways that limit warming to 3°C (>50%) or lower (C1-C6) compared to scenarios with <4°C 
Figure 
The overall land dynamics in <1.5°C, <2°C and <3°C mitigation pathways are shaped by land-demanding mitigation options such as bioenergy and afforestation, in addition to the demand for other agricultural and forest commodities. Bioenergy production and afforestation take place largely in the (partly) tropical regions ASIA, LAM and AFRICA, but also in OECD90+EU. Land for dedicated second generation bioenergy crops and afforestation displace agricultural land for food production (cropland and pasture) and other natural land. For instance, in the <1.5°C mitigation pathway in ASIA, bioenergy and forest area together increased by about 2.1 million km 2 between 2020 and 2100, mostly at the cost of cropland and pasture (median values). Such large-scale transformations of land use have repercussions on biogeochemical cycles (e.g., fertiliser and water) but also on the economy (e.g., food prices) and potential sociopolitical conditions.

## Marginal Abatement Costs According to Integrated Assessments ##
In this section, Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) results from the AR6 database are used to derive marginal abatement costs which indicate the economic mitigation potential for the different gases (N 2 O, CH 4 , CO 2 ) related to the AFOLU sector, at the global level and at the level of five world regions. This review provides a complementary view on the economic mitigation potentials estimated in Section 7.4 by implicitly taking into account the interlinkages between the landbased mitigation options themselves as well as the interlinkages with mitigation options in the other sectors such as BECCS. The review systematically evaluates a range of possible economic potential estimates across gases, time, and carbon prices.
For different models and scenarios from the AR6 database, the amount of mitigated emissions is presented together with the respective carbon price (Figure 
potentials, scenarios are compared to a benchmark scenario which usually assumes business-as-usual trends and no explicit additional mitigation efforts. Scenarios have been excluded, if they do not have an associated benchmark scenario or fail the vetting according to the AR6 scenario database, or if they do not report carbon prices and CO 2 emissions from AFOLU. Scenarios with contradicting assumptions (for example, fixing some of the emissions to baseline levels) are excluded. Furthermore, only scenarios with consistent 3 regional and global level results are considered. Mitigation potentials are computed by subtracting scenario specific emissions and sequestration amounts from their respective benchmark scenario values. This difference CO 2 (in CO 2 -eq yr -1 ) CH 4 (in CO 2 -eq yr -1 ) N 2 O (in CO 2 -eq yr -1 )
Figure 
accounts for the mitigation that can be credited to the carbon price which is applied in a scenario. A few benchmark scenarios, however, apply already low carbon prices. For consistency reasons, a carbon price that is applied in a benchmark scenario is subtracted from the respective scenario specific carbon price. This may generate a bias because low carbon prices tend to have a stronger marginal impact on mitigation than high carbon prices. Scenarios with carbon prices which become negative due to the correction are not considered. The analysis considers all scenarios from the AR6 database which pass the criteria and should be considered as an ensemble of opportunity 
This approach is close to integrated assessment marginal abatement cost curves (MACCs) as described in the literature 
Hereby, some sequestration efforts can occur in other sectors, while leading to less mitigation in the AFOLU sector. For instance, as an integral part of many scenarios, BECCS deployment will lead to overall emissions reductions, and even provision of CDR as a result of the interplay between three direct components (i) LULUCF emissions/ sinks, (ii) reduction of fossil fuel use/emissions, (iii) carbon capture and sequestration. Since the latter two effects can compensate for the LULUCF effect, BECCS deployment in ambitious stabilisation scenarios may lead to reduced sink/increased emissions in LULUCF 
In the individual cases, the accounting of all these effects is dependent on the respective underlying model and its coverage of inter-relations of different sectors and sub-sectors. The presented potentials cover a wide range of models, and additionally, a wide range of background assumptions on macro-economic, technical, and behavioural developments as well as policies, which the models have been fed with. Subsequently, the range of the resulting marginal abatement costs is relatively wide, showing the full range of expected contributions from land-use sector mitigation and sequestration in applied mitigation pathways.
At the global level, the analysis of the economic mitigation potentials from N 2 O and CH 4 emissions from AFOLU (which mainly can be related to agricultural activities) and CO 2 emissions (which mainly can be related to LULUCF emissions) reveals a relatively good agreement of models and scenarios in terms of ranking between the gases. On the right-hand side panels of Figure 
N 2 O emissions show the smallest economic potential of the three different gases in 2030 as well as in 2050. The mitigation potential increases until a price range of USD150-200 and to a median value of around 0.6 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 mitigation in 2030 and 0.9 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 in 2050, respectively, while afterwards with higher prices the expansion is very limited. Mitigation of CH 4 emissions has a higher potential, also with increasing mitigation potentials until a price range of USD150-200 in both years, with median mitigation of around 1.3 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 in 2030 and around 2.4 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 in 2050, respectively. The highest mitigation potentials are observed for CO 2, but also the highest ranges of observations among the three gases. In 2030, a median of 4 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 mitigation potential is reported for the price range of USD200-250. In 2050, for the carbon price range of between USD100 and USD200, a median of around 4.8 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 can be observed.
When compared with the sectoral estimates from 
Economic CO 2 mitigation potentials from land-use change and forestry are larger compared to potentials from non-CO 2 gases, and at the same time reveal high levels of variation in absolute terms. The 66th percentile in 2050 goes up to 5.2 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 mitigation, while the lowest observations are even negative, indicating higher CO 2 emissions from land use in scenarios with carbon price compared to scenarios without (counterintuitive dynamics explained below).
Land use is at the centre of the interdependencies with other sectors, including energy. Some models see a strong competition between BECCS deployment with its respective demand for biomass, and CO 2 mitigation/sequestration potentials in the land sector. Biomass demand may lead to an increase in CO 2 emissions from land use despite the application of a carbon price when land-use expansion for dedicated biomass production, such as energy plantations, comes from carbon rich land use/land cover alternatives, or when increased extraction of biomass from existing land uses, such as forest management, leads to reduction of the carbon sink 

## Interaction Between Mitigation in the AFOLU Sector and Other SDGs in the Context of Integrated Assessments ##
Besides the level of biomass supply for bioenergy, the adoption of SDGs may also significantly impact AFOLU emissions and the landuse sector's ability for GHG abatement 

## Regional AFOLU Abatement for Different Carbon Prices ##
At the regional level (Figure 
GHG Mitigation (MtCO 2 -eq yr -1 )
Figure 
The highest potentials from land-related CO 2 emissions, including avoided deforestation as well as afforestation, can be observed in LAM and AFRICA with strong responses of mitigation (indicated by the median value) to carbon prices mainly in the lower range of displayed carbon prices. In general, CO 2 mitigation potentials show a wide range of results in comparison to non-CO 2 mitigation potentials, but mostly also a higher median value. The most extreme ranges are reported for the regions LAM and AFRICA. A medium potential is reported for ASIA and OECD+EU, while REF has the smallest potential according to model submissions. These estimates reflect techno-economic potentials and do not necessarily include feasibility constraints which are discussed in Chapter 7.6.

## Illustrative Mitigation Pathways ##
Different mitigation strategies can achieve the net emission reductions that would be required to follow a pathway limiting global warming, with very different consequences for the land system. Figure 
The scenario ModAct (limit warming to 3°C (>50%), C6) is based on the prolongation of current trends (SSP2) but contains measures to strengthen policies for the implementation of National Determined Contributions (NDCs) in all sectors including AFOLU 
IMP-Neg is similar to ModAct scenario in terms of socio-economic setting (SSP2) but differs strongly in terms of the mitigation target (limit warming to 2°C (>67%), C3) and its strong focus on the supply side of mitigation measures with strong reliance on net-negative emissions. Consequently, all GHG emission reductions as well as afforestation/reforestation and BECCS-based CDR start earlier in time at a higher rate of deployment. However, in contrast to CO 2 emissions, which turn net-negative around 2030 due to afforestation/ reforestation, CH 4 and N 2 O emissions persist throughout the century, similar to ModAct, due to ongoing increasing demand for total calories and animal-based commodities 
In consequence, compared to ModAct scenario, competition for land is increasing and much more other natural land as well as agricultural land (cropland and pasture land) is converted to forest or bioenergy cropland with potentially severe consequences for various sustainability dimensions such as biodiversity 
IMP-Ren is similar to IMP Neg-2.0 in terms of socio-economic setting (SSP2) but differs substantially in terms of mitigation target and mitigation efforts in the energy sector. Even under the more ambitious climate change mitigation target (1.5°C with no or low overshoot (OS), C1), the high share of renewable energy in IMP Ren strongly reduces the need for large-scale land-based CDR, which is reflected in smaller bioenergy and afforestation areas compared to IMP Neg-2.0. However, CH 4 and N 2 O emissions from AFOLU persist throughout the century, similar to ModAct scenario and IMP Neg-2.0.
In contrast to IMPs Neg-2.0 and Ren, IMP SP 

## Assessment of Economic, Social and Policy Responses ##


## Retrospective in Policy Efforts and Achieved Mitigation Within AFOLU ##
Since the establishment of the UNFCCC, international agencies, countries, sub-national units and NGO's have developed policies to facilitate and encourage GHG mitigation within AFOLU (Figure 
Early guidance and policies focused on developing GHG inventory methodology with some emphasis on afforestation and reforestation projects, but the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) in the Kyoto Protocol focused attention on emission reduction projects, mostly outside of AFOLU. As successive IPCC AR6 WGIII reports illustrated large potential for AFOLU mitigation, methods to quantify and verify carbon emission reductions emerged within several projects in the early 2000s, through both voluntary (e.g., the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX)) and regulated (e.g., New South Wales and California) markets. The CDM dedicated large attention to LULUCF, including dedicated methodologies and bodies. The reasons for limited uptake of CDM afforestation/reforestation projects were multiple and not limited to the regulatory constraints, but also due to the low abatement potential (poor cost/performance ratio) compared to other mitigation opportunities.
Following COP 13 in Bali, effort shifted to advancing policies to reduce deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) in developing countries. According to 
A new assessment of projects over the last two decades finds emission reductions or offsets of at least 7.9 GtCO 2 -eq (using GWP100 and a mix of IPCC values for CH 4 and N 2 O) over the last 12 years due to agricultural and forestry activities (Table 
The array of activities in accepted protocols or measures and the availability of data to quantify outcomes.
The largest share of emission reductions or carbon offsets in Table 
.
The large number of policy approaches described in Canadian provinces have developed a range of policy options that can include carbon offsets. Quebec has an emissions trading programme that plans to allow forest and agricultural offsets generated within the province to be utilised. Alberta also allows offsets to be utilised by regulated sectors while British Columbia allows offsets to be utilised by the government for its carbon neutrality goals (Government of Alberta, 2021). Over 20 countries and regions have adopted explicit carbon taxes on carbon emission sources and fossil fuels, however, the charges have not been applied to non-CO 2 agricultural emissions (OECD 2021a). California may implement regulations on methane emissions from cattle, however, regulations if approved, will not go into effect until 2024. Institutional and trade-related barriers (e.g., leakage) likely will limit widespread implementation of taxes on emissions in the food sector globally. Many countries exempt purchases of fuels used in agricultural or fishery production from fuel or carbon taxes, thus lowering the effective tax rate imposed on those sectors (OECD 2021a). Furthermore, bioenergy, produced from agricultural products, agricultural waste, and wood is often exempted from explicit carbon taxes. Colombia recently implemented a carbon tax on liquid fuels but allowed domestically produced forestry credits to offset the tax. Colombia also is in the process of developing an emissions trading scheme (OECD 2021a).
REDD+/Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES). PES programmes for a variety of ecosystem services have long been utilised for conservation (e.g., 
A large literature has investigated whether PES programmes have successfully protected habitats. Studies in the USA found limited additionality for programmes that encouraged conservation tillage practices, but stronger additionality for programmes that encouraged set-asides for grasslands or forests 
Evidence from the EU similarly suggests that payments for some agroenvironmental practices may be additional, while others are not 
While expectations that carbon-centred REDD+ would be a simple and efficient mechanism for climate mitigation have not been met 
Empirical evidence that REDD+ funding has slowed deforestation is starting to emerge. 
Agroenvironmental Subsidy Programs/PES. Climate policy for agriculture has developed more slowly than in other sectors due to concerns with food security and livelihoods, political interests, and difficulties in coordinating diffuse and diverse activities and stakeholders (e.g., nutritional health, rural development, and biodiversity conservation) 
Agriculture is one of the most subsidised industries globally, especially in the European Union and the USA. While subsidy payments over the last 20 years have shifted modestly to programmes designed to reduce the environmental impact of the agricultural sector, only 15-20% of the more than USD700 billion spent globally on subsidies are green payments (OECD 2021b). Under the Common Agricultural Policy in the EU, up to 30% of the direct payments to farmers (Pillar 1) have been green payments 
The USA spends USD4 billion yr -1 on conservation programs, or 12% of net farm income (Department of Agriculture 2020). In real terms, this expenditure has remained constant for 15 years, supporting 12 Mha of permanent grass or woodland cover in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), which has increased soil carbon sequestration by 3 tCO 2 ha -1 yr -1 
China has implemented large conservation programmes that have influenced carbon stocks. For example, the Sloping Land Conversion Program, combined with other programs, has increased forest cover and carbon stocks, reduced erosion and increased other ecosystem services in China in recent years 

## Regulatory Approaches ##
Regulations on land use include direct controls on how land is used, zoning, or legally set limits on converting land from one use to another. Since the early 2000s, Brazil has deployed various regulatory measures to slow deforestation, including enforcement of regulations on land-use change in the legal Amazon area. Enforcement of these regulations, among other approaches is credited with encouraging the large-scale reduction in deforestation and associated carbon emissions after 2004 
Many OECD countries have strong legal frameworks that influence agricultural and forest management on both public and private land. Set asides and protected areas have been a widely utilised approach for conservation, and according to (FAO 2020d), 726 Mha (18%) of forests are in protected areas globally. A review of land sparing and land sharing policies in developing countries indicated that most of them follow land sparing models, sometimes in combination with land sharing approaches. However, there is still no clear evidence of which policy provides the best results for ecosystem services provision, conservation, and livelihoods 

## Community ##
Introduction to the case. Forest management and timber harvesting operations began shortly after the Menominee Indian Reservation was created by treaty in 1854. The Menominee reservation sits on about 95,000 ha of land in Wisconsin that spans multiple forest types and is more diverse than adjacent forests. The collectively maintained reservation has 87% of its land under sustained yield forestry.
Case description. The Tribe, in the 19th century, had already mastered vegetation manipulation with fire, sustainable forestry, multiple-use, ecosystem, and adaptive management. The centrepiece of the Tribe's economy has been its forest product industry, Menominee Tribal Enterprises (MTE) 

## Interactions and limitations. ##
In 2013, the Menominee Tribe started a collaboration with the US Forest Service to implement climate adaptation measures. The Tribe actively works to reduce the risk of forest damage and decided to further promote diversity by planting tree seedlings adapted to a warming climate (https://toolkit.climate.gov/case-studies/and-trees-will-last-forever). However, new challenges are related to increasing pressures on forest ecosystems such as non-native insects, pathogens, weed invasions, and the costs for continuous forest inventories to support long-term forest management.
Identified lessons. The elements of sustainability are intertwined with Menominee history, culture, spirituality, and ethics. The balance between the environment, community, and economy for the short term as well as future generations is an example of protecting the entire environment as the Menominee land is a non-fragmented remnant of the prehistoric Lake States forest which has been dramatically reduced all around the reserve 

## Voluntary Actions and Agreements ##
Forest certification programs, such as Forest Sustainability Council (FSC) or Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), are consumer driven, voluntary programmes that influence timber harvesting practices, and may reduce emissions from forest degradation with reduced impact logging and other approaches (medium confidence). Forest certification has expanded globally to over 440 Mha 
Supply chain management in the food sector encourages more widespread use of conservation measures in agriculture (high confidence). The number of private commitments to reduce deforestation from supply chains has greatly increased in recent years, with at least 865 public commitments by 447 producers, processors, traders, manufacturers and retailers as of December, 2020 (New York Declaration on Forests 2021). Industry partnerships with NGOs, such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), have become more widespread and visible in agricultural production. For example, RSPO certifies members all along the supply chain for palm oil and claims around 19% of total production. Similar sustainability efforts exist for many of the world's major agricultural products, including soybeans, rice, sugar cane, and cattle.
There is evidence that the Amazon Soy Moratorium (ASM), an industry-NGO effort whereby large industry consumers agreed voluntarily not to purchase soybeans grown on land deforested after 2006, reduced deforestation in the legal Amazon 
Box 7.9 | Case Study: Deforestation Control in the Brazilian Amazon

## Summary ##
Between 2000 and 2004, deforestation rates in the Brazilian Legal Amazon (is a socio-geographic division containing all nine Brazilian states in the Amazon basin) increased from 18,226 to 27,772 km 2 yr -1 2008 (INPE, 2021). A set of public policies designed in participatory process involving federal government, states, municipalities, and civil society successfully reduced deforestation rates until 2012. However, deforestation rates increased after 2013, and particularly between 2019 and 2020. Successful deforestation control policies are being negatively affected by changes in environmental governance, weak law enforcement, and polarisation of the national politics.
Box 7.9 (Continued)

## Background ##
In 2004, the Brazilian federal government started the Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm) (Ministry of 
The PPCDAm was a benchmark for the articulation of forest conservation policies that included central and state governments, prosecutor offices, and the civil society. The decline in deforestation after 2008 is mostly attributed to these policy options. In 2012, deforestation rates decreased to 4,571 km 2 yr -1 .

## Case description ##
Combating deforestation was a theme in several programs, government plans, and projects not being more restricted to the environmental agenda. This broader inclusion resulted from a long process of insertion and articulation in the government dating back to 2003 while elaborating on the Sustainable Amazon Plan. In May 2003, a historic meeting took place in an Amazonian city, with the president of the Republic, state governors, ministers, and various business leaders, civil institutions, and social movements. It was presented and approved the document entitled 'Sustainable Amazonia -Guidelines and Priorities of the Ministry of Environment for the Sustainable Development of the Amazon Brazilian', containing several guidelines for conservation and sustainable use in the region. At the meeting, the Union and some states signed a Cooperation Agreement aiming to elaborate a plan for the Amazon, to be widely discussed with the various sectors of the regional and national society (Ministerio do Meio Ambiente, MMA, 2013).

## Interactions and limitations ##
The PPCDAm had three main lines of action: (i) territorial management and land use; (ii) command and control; and (iii) promotion of sustainable practices. During the execution of the 1st and 2nd phases of the 

## Lessons ##
The reduction of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon was possible due to effective political and institutional support for environmental conservation. The initiatives of the Action Plan included the expansion of the protected areas network (conservation unities and indigenous lands), improvement of deforestation monitoring to the enforcement of environmental laws, and the use of economic instruments, for example, by cutting off public credit for municipalities with higher deforestation rates 
The array of public policies and social engagement was a historical and legal breakthrough in global protection. However, the broader political and institutional context and actions to reduce the representation and independent control of civil society movements in decision-making bodies weaken this structure with significant increases in deforestation rates, burnings, and forest fires.
7.6.2.4 Mitigation Effectiveness: Additionality, Permanence and Leakage Additionality, permanence and leakage have been widely discussed in the forestry and agricultural mitigation literature 
Typically, carbon registries will require that project developers show additionality by illustrating that the project is not undertaken as a result of a legal requirement, and that the project achieves carbon reductions above and beyond a business as usual. The protocols developed by the California Air Resources Board to ensure permanence and additionality are strong standards and may even limit participation (e.g., 
However, alternative statistical approaches have been deployed in the literature to assess additionality with a quasi-experimental method that rely on developing a counterfactual (e.g., 
The same experimental methods have been applied to analyse additionality of the adoption of soil conservation and nutrient management practices in agriculture. 

## Case description ##
More than 200 million trees have regenerated on more than 5 Mha in the Sahel 

## Lessons ##
A mélange of factors contributed to regreening in the Sahel. Increased precipitation, migration, community development, economic volatility and local policy reform have all likely played a role 
Regreening takes place when dormant seed or tree stumps sprout and are cultivated through the technique, called Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR). Without planting new trees, FMNR is presumed to be cheaper than other approaches to restoration, though comparative economic analysis has yet to be conducted 
Regreening in the Sahel and the consequent transformation of the landscape has resulted from the actions of hundreds of thousands of individuals responding to social and biophysical signals 
tillage is rarely additional. 
Permanence focuses on the potential for carbon sequestered in offsets to be released in the future due to natural or anthropogenic disturbances. Most offset registries have strong permanence requirements, although they vary in their specific requirements. The Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) from the Verra programme requires a pool of additional carbon credits that provides a buffer against inadvertent losses. The Climate Action Reserve (CAR) protocol for forests requires carbon to remain on the site for 100 years. The carbon on the site will be verified at pre-determined intervals over the life of the project. If carbon is diminished on a given site, the credits for the site have to be relinquished and the project developer has to use credits from their reserve fund (either other projects or purchased credits) to make up for the loss. Estimates of leakage in forestry projects in AR5 suggest that it can range from 10% to over 90% in the USA 
More recent literature has developed explicit estimates of leakage based on statistical analysis of carbon projects or programs. The literature suggests that there are two economic pathways for leakage (e.g., 

## Assessment of Current Policies and Potential Future Approaches ##
The Paris Agreement encourages a wide range of policy approaches, including REDD+, sustainable management of forests, joint mitigation and adaptation, and emphasises the importance of non-carbon benefits and equity for sustainable development 
To date, there has been significantly less investment in agricultural projects than forestry projects to reduce net carbon emissions (Table 
Although quantified emission reductions in agricultural projects are limited to date, a number of OECD and economy in transition parties have reduced their net emissions through carbon storage in cropland soils since 2000. These reductions in emissions have typically resulted from policy innovations outside of the climate space, or market trends. For example, in the USA, there has been widespread adoption of conservation tillage in the last 30 years as a labour-saving crop management technique. In Europe, agricultural N 2 O and CH 4 emissions have declined due to reductions in nutrient inputs and cattle numbers 
Numerous developing countries have established policy efforts to abate agricultural emissions or increase carbon storage. Brazil, for instance, developed a subsidy programme in 2010 to promote sustainable development in agriculture, and practices that would reduce GHG emissions. 
Existing policies focused on GHG management in agriculture and forestry is less advanced in Africa than in Latin American and Asia, however, 
The agricultural sector throughout the world is influenced by many policies that affect production practices, crop choices and land use. It is difficult to quantify the effect of these policies on reference level GHG emissions from the sector, as well as the cost estimates presented in Sections 7.4 and 7.5. The presence of significant subsidy programmes intended to improve farmer welfare and rural livelihoods makes it more difficult to implement regulatory programmes aimed at reducing net emissions in agriculture, however, it may increase the potential to implement new subsidy programmes that encourage practices aimed at reducing net emissions (medium confidence). For instance, in the USA, crop insurance can influence both crop choices and land use 

## Box 7.11 | Sustainable Intensification Within Agriculture: Evidence and Caveats Introduction ##
Sustainable intensification (SI) has received considerable attention as a suggested means of pursuing increased overall production, reducing associated environmental externalities, and potentially releasing agricultural land for alternative uses, such as forestry or rewilding 

## The extent of sustainable intensification ##
Total global agricultural land area has remained relatively stable while overall production has increased in recent decades (Section 7.3), indicating that agricultural intensification, as judged by production per unit of land 

## Preconditions to ensure sustainable intensification ##
Increasing the total amount of product produced by improving production efficiency (output per unit of input) does not guarantee SI. It will only be successful if increased production efficiency translates into reduced environmental and social impacts as well as increased production. For example, AR5 highlighted a growing emphasis on reducing GHG emissions per unit of product via increasing production efficiency 
Defined indicators are required. Measurement of SI requires multiple indicators and metrics. It can be assessed at farm, regional or global scales and temporal aspect must be considered. SI may warrant whole system redesign or land reallocation 
If biomass energy production expands and shifts to carbon capture and storage (e.g., BECCS) during the century, there could be a significant increase in the area of crop and forestland used for biomass energy production (Sections 7.4 and 7.5). BECCS is not projected to be widely implemented for several decades, but in the meantime, policy efforts to advance land-based measures including reforestation and restoration activities 

## Barriers and Opportunities for AFOLU Mitigation ##
The AR5 and other assessments have acknowledged many barriers and opportunities to effective implementation of AFOLU measures. Many of these barriers and opportunities focus on the context in developing countries, where a significant portion of the world's cost-effective mitigation exists, but where domestic financing for implementation is likely to be limited. The SSPs capture some of this context, and as a result, IAMs (Section 7.5) exhibit a wide range of land-use outcomes, as well as mitigation potential. Potential mitigation, however, will be influenced by barriers and opportunities that are not considered by IAMs or by bottom-up studies reviewed here. For example, more efficient food production systems, or sustainable intensification within agriculture, and globalised trade could enhance the extent of natural ecosystems leading to lower GHG emissions from the land system and lower food prices 
Impacts may be considered in relative terms (per area or product unit), with relationships potentially antagonistic. Both area-and product unit-based metrics are valid, relevant under different contexts and useful in approaching SI, but do not capture overall impacts and trade-offs 

## Avoiding unsustainable intensification ##
It is critical that intensification does not drive expansion of unsustainable practices. Increased productivity with associated economic reward could incentivise and reward agricultural land expansion, or environmentally and socially damaging practices on existing and former agricultural land 
In conclusion, SI within agriculture is needed given the rising global population and the need to address multiple environmental and social externalities associated with agricultural activities. However, implementation requires strong stakeholder engagement, appropriate regulations, rigorous monitoring and verification and comprehensive outreach and knowledge exchange programmes.
7.6.4.1 Socio-economic Barriers and Opportunities
Design and coverage of financing mechanisms. The lack of resources thus far committed to implementing AFOLU mitigation, income and access to alternative sources of income in rural households that rely on agriculture or forests for their livelihoods remains a considerable barrier to adoption of AFOLU (high confidence). Section 7.6.1 illustrates that to date only USD0.7 billion yr -1 has been spent on AFOLU mitigation, well short of the more than USD400 billion yr -1 that would be needed to achieve the economic potential described in Section 7.4. Despite long-term recognition that AFOLU can play an important role in mitigation, the economic incentives necessary to achieve AFOLU aspirations as part of the Paris Agreement or to maintain temperatures below 2.0°C have not emerged. Without quickly ramping up spending, the lack of funding to implement projects remains a substantial barrier (high confidence).
Investments are critically important in the livestock sector, which has the highest emissions reduction potential among options because actions in the sector influence agriculture specific activities, such as enteric fermentation, as well as deforestation 
Scale and accessibility of financing. The largest share of funding to date has been for REDD+, and many of the commitments to date suggest that there will be significant funding in this area for the foreseeable future. Funding for conservation programmes in OECD countries and China affects carbon, but has been driven
by other objectives such as water quality and species protection.
Considerably less funding has been available for agricultural projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions, and outside of voluntary markets, there do not appear to be large sources of funding emerging either through international organisations, or national programs. In the agricultural sector, funding for carbon must be obtained by redirecting existing resources from non-GHG conservation to GHG measures, or by developing new funding streams 

## Risk and uncertainty ##
Financing needs in AFOLU, and in particular in forestry, include both the direct effects of any changes in activities -costs of planting or managing trees, net revenues from harvesting, costs of thinning, costs of fire management, and so on -as well as the opportunity costs associated with land-use change. Opportunity costs are a critical component of AFOLU finance, and must be included in any estimate of the funds necessary to carry out projects. They are largest, as share of total costs, in forestry because they play a prominent role in achieving high levels of afforestation, avoided deforestation, and improved forest management. In case of increasing soil carbon in croplands through reduced tillage, there are often cost savings associated with increased residues because there is less effort tilling, but the carbon effects per hectare are also modest. There could, however, be small opportunity costs in cases where residues may otherwise be marketed to a biorefinery. The effect of reduced tillage on yields varies considerably across sites and crop types, but tends to enhance yields modestly in the longer-run.
Opportunity costs are a direct financing costs for activities that require land uses to change. For instance a government can encourage planting forests on agricultural land by (a) requiring it, (b) setting up a market or market-based incentives, or (c) buying the land and doing it themselves. In each case, the required investment is the same -the planting cost plus the net foregone returns of agricultural rents -even though a different entity pays the cost. Private entities that pay for carbon credits will also bear the direct costs of planting plus the opportunity costs. In the case of avoided deforestation, opportunity costs similarly must be paid to individual actors to avoid the deforestation. Opportunity for political participation of local stakeholders is barrier in most places where forest ownership rights are not sufficiently documented 
Clear land tenure and land-use rights. Unclear property rights and tenure insecurity undermine the incentives to improve forest and agricultural productivity, lead to food insecurity, undermine REDD+ objectives, discourage adoption of farm conservation practices, discourage tree planting and forest management, and exacerbate conflict between different land users 
Lack of institutional capacity. Institutional complexity, or lack thereof, represents a major challenge when implementing large and complex mitigation programmes (e.g., REDD+) in agriculture, forest and other land uses 

## Ecological Barriers and Opportunities ##
Availability of land and water. Climate mitigation scenarios in the two recent special reports (SR1.5 and SRCCL) that aim to limit global temperature increase to 2°C or less involve carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) removal from the atmosphere. To support large-scale CDR, these scenarios involve significant land-use change, due to afforestation/reforestation, avoided deforestation, and deployment of biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). While a considerable amount of land is certainly available for new forests or new bioenergy crops, that land has current uses that will affect not only the costs, but also the willingness of current users or owners, to shift uses. Regions with private property rights and a history of market-based transactions may be the most feasible for land-use change or land management change to occur. Areas with less secure tenure or a land market with fewer transactions in general will likely face important hurdles that limit the feasibility of implementing novel nature-based solutions.
Implementation of nature-based solution may have local or regionally important consequences for other ecosystem services, some of which may be negative (high confidence). Land-use change has important implications for the hydrological cycle, and the large land-use shifts suggested for BECCS when not carried out in a carefully planned manner, are expected to increase water demands substantially across the globe 

## Specific soil conditions, water availability, GHG emissionreduction potential as well as natural variability and resilience. ##
Recent analysis by 
The effects of climate change on ecosystems, including changes in crop yields, shifts in terrestrial ecosystem productivity, vegetation migration, wildfires, and other disturbances also will affect the potential for AFOLU mitigation. Climate is expected to reduce crop yields, increase crop and livestock prices, and increase pressure on undisturbed forest land for food production creating new barriers and increasing costs for implementation of many nature-based mitigation techniques (medium confidence) (IPCC AR6 WGII Chapter 5).
The observed increase in the terrestrial sink over the past half century can be linked to changes in the global environment, such as increased atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, N deposition, or changes in climate 
Increasing concentrations of CO 2 are expected to increase carbon stocks globally, with the strongest effects in the tropics 
In addition to climate change, 
Adaptation benefits and biodiversity conservation. Biodiversity may improve resilience to climate change impacts as more-diverse systems could be more resilient to climate change impacts, thereby maintaining ecosystem function and preserving biodiversity 

## Technological Barriers and Opportunities ##
Monitoring, reporting, and verification. Development of satellite technologies to assess potential deforestation has grown in recent years with the release of 30 m data by 
Ground-based forest inventory measurements have been developed in many countries, most prominently in the Northern Hemisphere, but more and more countries are starting to develop and collect national forest inventories. Training and capacity building is going on in many developing countries under UNREDD and FAO programmes. Additional efforts to harmonise data collection methods and to make forest inventory data available to the scientific community would improve confidence in forest statistics, and changes in forest statistics over time. To some extent the Global Forest Biodiversity Initiative fills in this data gap (https://gfbi.udl.cat/).

## Linkages to Ecosystem Services, Human Wellbeing and Adaptation (including SDGs) ##
The linkage between biodiversity, ecosystem services, human well-being and sustainable development is widely acknowledged (Millenium Ecosystem Assesment 2005; UNEP 2019). Loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services will have an adverse impact on quality of life, human well-being and sustainable development (IPBES 2019a). Such losses will not only affect current economic growth but also impede the capacity for future economic growth.
Population growth, economic development, urbanisation, technology, climate change, global trade and consumption, policy and governance are key drivers of global environmental change over recent decades 
The increasing trend in aquaculture production especially in South and South-East Asia through intensive methods affects existing food production and ecosystems by diverting rice fields or mangroves 
Currently, land degradation is estimated to have reduced productivity in 23% of the global terrestrial area, and between USD235 billion and USD577 billion in annual global crop output is at risk because of pollinator loss (IPBES 2019a). The global trends reviewed above are based on data from 2000 studies. It is not clear whether the assessment included a quality control check of the studies evaluated and suffer from aggregation bias. For instance, a recent metaanalysis of global forest valuation studies noted that many studies reviewed had shortcomings such as failing to clearly mention the methodology and prices used to value the forest ecosystem services, double counting, data errors, and so on 
Land degradation has had a pronounced impact on ecosystem functions worldwide (IPBES 2018e). Net primary productivity of ecosystem biomass and of agriculture is presently lower than it would have been under a natural state on 23% of the global terrestrial area, amounting to a 5% reduction in total global net primary productivity (IPBES 2018e). Over the past two centuries, soil organic carbon, an indicator of soil health, has seen an estimated 8% loss globally (176 GtC) from land conversion and unsustainable land management practices (IPBES 2018e). Projections to 2050 predict further losses of 36 GtC from soils, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. These losses are projected to come from the expansion of agricultural land into natural areas (16 GtC), degradation due to inappropriate land management (11 GtC) and the draining and burning of peatlands (9 GtC) and melting of permafrost (IPBES 2018e). Trends in biodiversity measured by the global living planet index between 1970 to 2016 indicate a 68% decline in monitored population of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and fish (WWF 2020). FAO's recent report on the state of the world's biodiversity for food and agriculture points to an alarming decline in biodiversity for food and agriculture including associated biodiversity such as pollination services, microorganisms which are essential for production systems (FAO 2019d). These suggest that overall ecosystem health is consistently declining with adverse consequences for good quality of life, human well-being, and sustainable development.
Although numerous studies have estimated the value of ecosystem services for different sites, ecosystems, and regions, these studies mostly evaluate ecosystem services at a single point in time 
For instance, a study of climate-smart cocoa production in Ghana shows that due to lack of tenure (tree) rights, bureaucratic and legal hurdles in registering trees in cocoa farms, and other barriers small cocoa producers could not realise the project benefits (Box 7.13).
Experience of CSA in some other sub-Saharan African countries and other countries such as Belize too has been constrained by weak extension systems and policy implementation, and other barriers 

## Box 7.13 | Case Study: Climate-smart Cocoa Production in Ghana ##
Policy objectives i. To promote sustainable intensification of cocoa production and enhance the adaptive capacity of small cocoa producers. ii. To reduce cocoa-induced deforestation and GHG emissions. iii. To improve productivity, incomes, and livelihoods of smallholder cocoa producers.

## Policy mix ##
The climate-smart cocoa (CSC) production programme in Ghana involved distributing shade tree seedlings that can protect cocoa plants from heat and water stress, enhance soil organic matter and water holding capacity of soils, and provide other assistance with agroforestry, giving access to extension services such as agronomic information and agrochemical inputs. The shade tree seedlings were distributed by NGOs, government extension agencies, and the private sector free of charge or at subsidised prices and was expected to reduce pressure on forests for growing cocoa plants. The CSC programme was mainly targeted at small farmers who constitute about 80% of total farm holdings in Ghana. Although the government extension agency (Cocobod) undertook mass spraying or pruning of cocoa farms they found it difficult to access the 800,000 cocoa smallholders spread across the tropical south of the country. The project brought all stakeholders together, in other words, the government, private sector, local farmers and civil society or NGOs to facilitate the sustainable intensification of cocoa production in Ghana. Creation of a community-based governance structure was expected to promote benefit sharing, forest conservation, adaptation to climate change, and enhanced livelihood opportunities.
7.6.5.2 Human Well-being and Sustainable Development Goals
Conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services is part of the larger objective of building climate resilience and promoting good quality of life, human well-being and sustainable development.
While two of the 17 SDGs directly relate to nature (SDGs 14 and 15 covering marine and terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity), most other SDGs relating to poverty, hunger, inequality, health and wellbeing, clean sanitation and water, energy, and so on, are directly or indirectly linked to nature 
Current negative trends in biodiversity and ecosystem services will undermine progress towards achieving 80% (35 out of 44) of the assessed targets of SDGs related to poverty, hunger, health, water, cities, climate, oceans and land (IPBES 2019a). However, 
Progress in achieving the 20 Aichi Biodiversity targets which are critical for realising the SDGs has been poor with most of the targets not being achieved or only partially realised (SCBD 2020). There could be synergies and trade-offs between ecosystem services and human well-being. For instance, a study notes that although policy interventions and incentives to enhance supply of provisioning services (e.g., agricultural production) have led to higher GDP, it may have an adverse effect on the regulatory services of ecosystems 
Box 7.13 (continued)

## Governance context ##


## Critical enablers ##
The role assigned to local government mechanisms such as Ghana's Community Resource Management Area Mechanisms (CREMAs) was expected to give a voice to smallholders who are an important stakeholder in Ghana's cocoa sector. CREMAs are inclusive because authority and ownership of natural resources are devolved to local communities who can thus have a voice in influencing CSC policy thereby ensuring equity and adapting CSC to local contexts. However, ensuring the long-term sustainability of CREMAs will help to make them a reliable mechanism for farmers to voice their concerns and aspirations, and ensure their independence as a legitimate governance structure in the long run. The private sector was assigned an important role to popularise climate-smart cocoa production in Ghana. However, whether this will work to the advantage of smallholder cocoa producers needs to be seen.

## Critical barriers ##
The policy intervention overlooks the institutional constraints characteristic of the cocoa sector in Ghana where small farmers are dominant and have skewed access to resources and markets. Lack of secure tenure (tree rights) where the ownership of shade trees and timber vests with the state, bureaucratic and legal hurdles to register trees in their cocoa farms are major constraints that impede realisation of the expected benefits of the CSC programme. This is a great disincentive for small cocoa producers to implement CSC initiatives and nurture the shade tree seedlings and undertake land improvement measures. The state marketing board has the monopoly in buying and marketing of cocoa beans including exports which impeded CREMAs or farming communities from directly selling their produce to MNCs and traders. However, many MNCs have been involved in setting up of CREMA or similar structures, extending premium prices and non-monetary benefits (access to credit, shade tree seedlings, agrochemicals) thus indirectly securing their cocoa supply chains. A biased ecological discourse about the benefits of climate-smart agriculture and sustainable intensive narrative, complexities regarding the optimal shade levels for growing cocoa, and dependence on agrochemicals are issues that affect the success and sustainability of the project intervention. Dominance of private sector players especially MNCs in the sector may be detrimental to the interests of smallholder cocoa producers 
7.6.5.3 Land-based Mitigation and Adaptation
Combined mitigation and adaptation approaches have been highlighted throughout Section 7.4 regarding specific measures. Land-based mitigation and adaptation to the risks posed by climate change and extreme weather events can have several co-benefits as well as help promote development and conservation goals.
Land-based mitigation and adaptation will not only help reduce GHG emissions in the AFOLU sector, but measures are required to closely link up with adaptation. In the central 2°C scenario, improved management of land and more efficient forest practices, a reduction in deforestation and an increase in afforestation, would account for 10% of the total mitigation effort over 2015-2050 

## Knowledge Gaps ##
Closing knowledge gaps and narrowing uncertainties are crucial to advance AFOLU mitigation. Knowledge gaps exist across a range of areas, from emissions accounting and mitigation measure development to integration of scientific and traditional knowledge and development and sustainable implementation strategies. The following are identified as priorities:
• Uncertainty in contemporary emissions and sinks within AFOLU is still high. There is ongoing need to develop and refine emission factors, improve activity data and facilitate knowledge exchange, concerning inventories and accounting. For example, insufficient knowledge on CO 2 emissions relating to forest management and burning or draining of organic soils (wetlands and peatlands), limits certainty on CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes. • Improved monitoring of the land CO 2 balance is urgently needed, including impacts of land degradation and restoration efforts (e.g., in tropical and boreal regions), making use of combined remote sensing, artificial intelligence, ground-based and modelling tools 
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) FAQ 7.1 | Why is the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Uses (AFOLU) sector unique when considering GHG mitigation?
There are three principal reasons that make the AFOLU sector unique in terms of mitigation:
In contrast to other sectors, AFOLU can facilitate mitigation in several different ways. Specifically, AFOLU can (i) reduce emissions as a sector in its own right, (ii) remove meaningful quantities of carbon from the atmosphere and relatively cheaply, and (iii) provide raw materials to enable mitigation within other sectors, such as energy, industry or the built environment.
The emissions profile of AFOLU differs from other sectors, with a greater proportion of non-CO 2 gases (N 2 O and CH 4 ). The impacts of mitigation efforts within AFOLU can vary according to which gases are targeted, as a result of the differing atmospheric lifetime of the gases and differing global temperature responses to the accumulation of the specific gases in the atmosphere.
In addition to tackling climate change, AFOLU mitigation measures have capacity, where appropriately implemented, to help address some critical, wider challenges, as well as contributing to climate change adaptation. AFOLU is inextricably linked with some of the most serious challenges that are suggested to have ever faced humanity, such as large-scale biodiversity loss, environmental degradation and the associated consequences. As AFOLU concerns land management and utilises a considerable portion of the Earth's terrestrial area, the sector greatly influences soil, water and air quality, biological and social diversity, the provision of natural habitats, and ecosystem functioning, consequently impacting many SDGs.

## FAQ 7.2 | What AFOLU measures have the greatest economic mitigation potential? ##
Economic mitigation potential refers to the mitigation estimated to be possible at an annual cost of up to USD100 tCO 2 -1 mitigated. This cost is deemed the price at which society is willing to pay for mitigation and is used as a proxy to estimate the proportion of technical mitigation potential that could realistically be implemented. Between 2020 and 2050, measures concerning forests and other ecosystem are estimated to have an average annual mitigation potential of 7.3 (3.9-13.1) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 at USD100 tCO 2 -1 . At the same cost, agricultural measures are estimated to have a potential of 4.1 (1.7-6.7) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 . Emerging technologies, such as CH 4 vaccines and inhibitors, could sustainably increase agricultural mitigation potential in future. The diverted production effects of changes in demand (reduced food losses, diet changes and improved and enhanced wood products use), is estimated to have an economic potential of 2.2 (1.1-3.6) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 . However, cost forms only one constraint to mitigation, with realisation of economic potential dependent on multiple context-specific environmental and socio-cultural factors.

## FAQ 7.3 | ##
What are potential impacts of large-scale establishment of dedicated bioenergy plantations and crops and why is it so controversial?
The potential of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) remains a focus of debate with several studies evaluating the level at which BECCS could be sustainably implemented, published since AR5. BECCS involves sequestering carbon through plant growth (i.e., in trees or crops) and capturing the carbon generated when this biomass is processed for power or fuel. The captured carbon then requires long-term storage in for example, geological, terrestrial or ocean reservoirs, or in products. While appearing to create a net removal of carbon from the atmosphere, BECCS requires land, water and energy which can create adverse side effects at scale. Controversy has arisen because some of the models calculating the energy mix required to keep the temperature to 1.5°C have included BECCS at very large scales as a means of both providing energy and removing carbon from the atmosphere to offset emissions from industry, power, transport or heat. For example, studies have calculated that for BECCS to achieve 11.5 GtCO 2 -eq per year of carbon removal in 2100, as envisaged in one scenario, 380-700 Mha or 25-46% of all the world's arable and cropland would be needed. In such a situation, competition for agricultural land seriously threatens food production and food security, while also impacting biodiversity, water and soil quality, and landscape aesthetic value. More recently however, the scenarios for BECCS have become much more realistic, though concerns regarding impacts on food security and the environment remain, while the reliability of models is uncertain due to methodological flaws. Improvements to models are required to better capture wider environmental and social impacts of BECCS in order to ascertain its sustainable contribution in emissions pathways. Additionally, the opportunity for other options that could negate very large-scale deployment of BECCS, such as other carbon dioxide removal measures or more stringent emission reductions in other sectors, could be explored within models.
