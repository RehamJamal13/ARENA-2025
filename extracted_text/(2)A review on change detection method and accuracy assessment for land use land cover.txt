ABSTRACT:
The assessment of land use land cover change is extremely important for understanding the relationship between humans and nature. The enormous changes at a regional scale and advancements in technology have encouraged researchers to gather more information. The remote sensing technology and GIS tools cooperatively have made it easier to monitor the changes in land use land cover (LULC) from past to present. This technology has unraveled the changes at the regional and global level and has also contributed tremendous benefits to the scientific community. A variety of change detection algorithms have been used in the history of remote sensing to detect changes at earth's surface and newer techniques are still in process. The data from remote sensing satellites are the primary sources that provide an opportunity to acquire information about LULC change in recent decades, which extensively use different algorithms according to the research needs. The selection of appropriate change detection method is highly recommended in every remote sensing project. This review paper begins with the traditional pre and post-classification change detection techniques related to LULC information at the regional level. Therefore, this paper evaluated the mostly used change detection method among all others to find remarkable results. Thus the review concludes the post-classification change detection method using maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) supervised classification is applicable in all cases. The comparative analysis was also performed in a selected region having multiple land features during review in which MLC results best in comparison to others. MLC is the most commonly used technique from the past till present that has achieved high accuracy in all regions comparatively to other techniques.

## Introduction ##
In the course of the past three decades, remote sensing technology along with the use of GIS has provoked the importance of LULC change assessment due to more rapid and extensive changes made on earth's surface 
The main purpose of this paper is to review and focus the type of earth's surface regions in the context of LULC classes to define the suitable change detection method for extracting better LULC change information whether by implementing pre-classification change detection technique or post-classification comparison technique of individually classified multi-temporal multispectral medium resolution remotely sensed satellite data because it is freely and easily available such as Landsat mission in comparison of high-resolution satellite data such as SPOT, IKONOS, QUICK BIRD, etc., which is much more costly for academic and individual researchers. Due to the importance of monitoring change in earth's surface features, there is a gigantic need for scientific research for the evaluation of change detection techniques which is currently an active topic and new techniques are continuously developing.

## A review of change detection techniques ##
In order to the selection of appropriate change detection methods, this review research has focused the evaluation of LULC features of different landscape regions to describe which change detection method is better to execute. Therefore in this section a diversity of change detection methods has been reviewed according to earth's land surface and has been categorized into eight different regions which are: 1) Vegetation, 2) Urbanization, 3) Delta Region, 4) Mountainous Region, 5) River Flow, 6) Coastal Zone, 7) Desertification, and 8) Watershed.
Most of the studies were trying to answer the reasons of what drives the changes in LULC of the region 

## Vegetation ##
A variety of change detection methods has been reviewed in this category. This category includes forest areas, agricultural areas, and large-scale plantation schemes such as orchards. 

## Urbanization ##
This category is based on the researches made upon cities and urban sprawl.
(K Ridd and Liu, 1998) compared four change detection algorithms in an urban environment of Salt Lake City metropolitan of Utah, United States. Image differencing, image regression, TCT, and CHI-square transformation were used to identify the best change detection method. The study was categorized into 7 categories which are: (1) Construction site to new residential (2) new residential to vegetated residential (3) Farmland to construction site (4) Farmland to industrial/commercial (5) Dry farm to green farm (6) Green farm to dry farm (7) Soil/Gravel tonal change. Among these 7 categories, this study concluded that none of the above mention algorithms has defined change in all 7 categories 

## Delta region ##
The review of estuaries and delta regions has been discussed in this section.
(X. 

## Mountainous region ##
The research study conducted on high and low steep mountainous and hilly region is reviewed here. 
Supervised classification MLC was used before the post-classification change detection technique to identify the type of land and the changes that occurred during the study period. The results showed a positive change in vegetation due to afforestation in the region and increasing trend in built-up, while a decrease in barren land and agriculture 

## River flow ##
The researches made on rivers and flood affected areas has been reviewed in this category.
(Sharma et al., 2011) assessed pre and post-flooding LULC change of three districts of Gujrat state, India. Three different classification approaches iso-data, MLC, and fuzzy rule base were applied to extract LULC information. The post-classification change detection method was used to detect "from-to" quantitative change analysis during the study period. The Kappa statistics values of all three classifications were computed and compared. The comparison of kappa values showed that un-supervised classification ISO-DATA achieved 0.78, supervised classification MLC achieved 0.84, and the Fuzzy rule base classification achieved 0.87 because fuzzy rule classification gave better separation of LULC classes 

## Coastal zone ##
The LULC assessment of coastline and seashore areas and its surroundings falls under this category. 

## Desertification ##
The drought and dry land areas falls under this category are reviewed. 

## Watershed ##
The researches on watershed are reviewed in this category. 

## Analysis of literature review ##
In the previous section, eight different regions were reviewed along with a variety of change detection techniques applied. This section will evaluate the most commonly used change detection method applied to many of the research studies in the past two decades until the present. The post-classification change detection using MLC supervised classification has been implemented the most and proposed by (H. 
Few studies had also applied pre-classification change detection technique for a single land feature to detect the changes and extract useful information, for example, NDVI was implemented by 
The comparative analysis of change detection methods is adapted to justify the best method through thematic accuracy assessment results as  
Remotely sensed data always vary in spatial, radiometric, spectral, temporal resolutions and different types of sensors which may result errors in image classification, so the selection of appropriate change detection methods is very much necessary, as concluded in this literature that for a classified remotely sensed data whether supervised or unsupervised post-classification comparison technique is the best for change detection of a landscape with multiple LULC classes while a landscape with complex LULC features which cannot be easily evaluated using traditional pixel by pixel classification techniques require some advance classification techniques such as sub-pixel classification, decision rule-based classification and fuzzy classification for precise evaluation of LULC features. The extraction of single land feature to assess change and no change or rate of change using remotely sensed data depends upon the landscape features such as humidity, soil moisture, sun angle and spatial resolution which justify the selection of appropriate change detection method.

## Selection of appropriate change detection method ##
In the field of remote sensing, analysis of the raster image for the selection of appropriate change detection method is important to extract useful LULC change information. The satellite image raw data may vary due to geometric and radiometric flaws because of the curved shape of    getting the best results (Figs. 
From the classification results, it is seen in Table 

## Thematic accuracy assessment ##
Accuracy assessment methods are used to validate the LULC map classification processes which decide the quality of gathered information justifying that the image pixels are well classified or misclassified from remotely sensed data. These accuracy assessments can result qualitatively which is usually a comparison between classified LULC map and on ground situation or quantitatively to identify and quantify by comparing classified map data with reference data, which is very much important for developing results assessment and decision-making. A variety of accuracy assessment methods has been discussed in the previous remote sensing literature 
Error matrix not only calculates the user, producer and overall accuracy but also allows calculating the kappa statistics which is generated to evaluate the percentage of well classification has been performed. Kappa coefficient of agreement justifies the classification performed perfect agreement or just equal to random or no agreement. User, producer and overall accuracy assessment is basically a chance result in certain accuracy and to get rid of the influence of chance; kappa estimation can be done by calculating coefficient of agreement and mathematically represented as  

## Table 4 ##
Assessment of overall accuracy.

## K% = 63% ##
Accuracy assessment of LULC change detection of remotely sensed data plays an important role in remote sensing and for the further information interested candidate should look at these two books 

## Conclusion & recommendation ##
The multi-temporal satellite images of the same sensor are prerequisites for determining the change and selection of appropriate change detection algorithms to achieve good change results. The analysis for the selection of appropriate change detection is a dynamic research topic and newer techniques are still being developed. This paper has a detailed review of change detection methods applied on different study areas but none of the single change detection methods is applicable at all cases (A. 
Above all, it is very clear from the above pie diagram that there were numerous change detection methods used in the past two decades among those post-classification using MLC is widely used. In practice, several change detection techniques are often used to implement change detection, whose results are then compared to identify the best product through visual assessment or quantitative accurate assessment. The selection of a suitable change detection method requires careful consideration which has been discussed in section 4. The major finding of the present study is that all methods are not hundred percent accurate, but post-classification yields useful information and should be viewed as complementary in comparison to the others. Therefore it is suggested to research scholars, the scientific community, and resource managers to apply the mentioned approach for change method to get the remarkable results that will be helpful in high thematic accuracy and acceptable outcomes to prevent further losses.
