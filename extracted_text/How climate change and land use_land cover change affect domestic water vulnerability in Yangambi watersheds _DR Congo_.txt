## Introduction ##
Many scientists are increasingly noting the influence of land use patterns on the degradation or improvement of water quality 
Given that dense tropical rainforests cover three-quarters of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) 
Unfortunately, as in most sub-Saharan African countries, the rate of access to safe water and sanitation remains paradoxically low 
Mismanagement is often cited to explain water issues in sub-Saharan countries in general-and in DRC in particular 
In Yangambi, an urban-rural area of Tshopo province in DRC, the National Rural Hydraulic Service (NRHS) is struggling to fulfill its mission because of a lack of funds and insufficient capacity to monitor the water resource. The few boreholes for standpipes in certain settlements (Bangala, Lumumba and Ekutsu), drilled in collaboration with partners, are no longer operational. Hence, access to quality water from the water points remains problematic. The population obtains water for its various domestic needs from springs and rivers, which are mostly unprotected.
A survey of 29 water suppliers in the United States by the Trust for Public Lands and the Spring Protection Committee showed that treatment costs are inversely related to the proportion of the watershed protected by forests, wetlands and other open space 
This deterioration of primary forest cover into other LULC types is thus likely a danger to the sustainability of watersheds in terms of water quality regulation 
Many reports by development agencies have noted the degradation of water quality in the region. In response, a careful assessment of the state of domestic water resources at the YBR (Yangambi Biosphere Reserve) is needed. This was proposed in a report by the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) in 2018 
Hence, the objectives of this study are (i) to typologize the watersheds in the Yangambi area in connection with the water physicochemical quality of the rivers in Yangambi; (ii) to verify whether the water physicochemical quality of the rivers in Yangambi meets World Health Organization (WHO) standards; and (iii) to analyze and assess the link between water and climate change adaptation (including vulnerability to climate change).

## Study Site ##
The study site is in the watersheds (irrigated by the Lusambila, Isalowe, Bonde, Lubilaie and Loweo rivers) of Yangambi in Tshopo province of DRC. It extends over an area of about 430.2 km 2 . The geographical position is between 0 • 45 58.1 north latitude and 24 • 4 6.13 east longitude, approximately 100 km west of Kisangani. Five main rivers irrigate this study area, of which three (Lusambila, Isalowe and Bonde) are direct tributaries to the Congo River, while the two others (Lubilaie and Loweo) initially flow into the Lobilo stream before flowing into the Congo River (Figure

## Study Site ##
The study site is in the watersheds (irrigated by the Lusambila, Isalowe, Bonde, Lubilaie and Loweo rivers) of Yangambi in Tshopo province of DRC. It extends over an area of about 430.2 km 2 . The geographical position is between 0°45'58.1'' north latitude and 24°4'6.13'' east longitude, approximately 100 km west of Kisangani. Five main rivers irrigate this study area, of which three (Lusambila, Isalowe and Bonde) are direct tributaries to the Congo River, while the two others (Lubilaie and Loweo) initially flow into the Lobilo stream before flowing into the Congo River (Figure 

## Methods ##


## Data Collection (a) Watershed delineation and morphometric characteristics ##
To delineate the five main watersheds in the study area, we used a shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM) file to obtain a digital terrain model. From there, we generated flow directions, flow accumulation raster and talweg segments. With the coordinates of the outlet, these tools helped us produce the raster of the watershed limits. This was then polygonized, to transform it into vectors to bring out the watershed boundaries.
From this watershed vectors shapefile, we generated the morphometric characteristics. These included the area (km 2 ), perimeter (km), Gravellius index (KG), average slope (%), stream length (km), drainage density (km/m 2 ), altitude (m), equivalent rectangle [length (km) and width (km)] and the different altitudes for different areas (hypsometry) within watersheds.
(b) Land use at watershed level We also produced landscape characteristics related to LULC in the watersheds from QGIS version 2.18.18 software. To detect differences in land cover within the watersheds, we downloaded two Sentinel_2B images for the complete study area from http://www. usgs.gov/ (accessed on 7 June and 1 September 2018) (United States Geological Survey). The processing of these two images consisted primarily in their correction. We assigned any clouds perceptible on the images-which could bias the quality of the classificationto the non-data class, i.e., without any appropriate theme. We then created virtual files of these two images. On the latter image, we carried out the random forest supervised classification to generate the different LULC in the Yangambi watersheds. Six training zones were created for each thematic class. The main land uses in Yangambi guided the choice of different training zones. These training zones and the images to be classified were imported into Monteverdi/OTB-6.2.0-Win64 software to generate the classification model and the confusion matrix. Based on this classification model, the Sentinel_2B image was classified into six different land use classes related directly to the different types of LULC in Yangambi. The confusion matrix allowed verification only of the accuracy of the classification performed by the computer. It was used to ensure no overlap between thematic classes. The latter had provided a precision rate of 96%, which was considered acceptable. Before carrying out the analyses, we checked the accuracy of the classification. To that end, we used 50 samples points produced randomly over the entire set of each polygon vector of the different types of LULC in the virtual classified image. We then imported these points into Google Earth to verify whether the thematic classes generated by the supervised random forest classification truly corresponded to the information that characterizes the study environment.
Finally, the LecoS 2.0.7 extension in QGIS version 2.18.18 allowed us to automatically produce landscape composition and configuration indices from the classified image. The following landscape indices were produced: I.
Composition indices: dense forest (DF), perturbed forest (PF), crop land (CL), grass land (GL), and bare soil and residential (BSR). II. Configuration indices: edge density (ED), patch density (PD), great patch area (GPA), mean patch area (MPA) and number of patches for the different composition indices (Table 
We carried out on-site analyses of pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen and turbidity at the site of sample collection following the standard protocols and methods of the American Public Health Organization 
(d) Study of the water resource's vulnerability in relation to climate change We used two different approaches to analyze the climate change vulnerability of water resources in Yangambi: a qualitative approach (based on survey results) and a biophysical approach (based on the meteorological data analysis from the Yangambi station).
The qualitative approach consisted of a survey on the state of water resources (including access, availability, capacity, use and environment) in Yangambi. This was based on the Water Poverty Index (WPI) as proposed by Sullivan and colleagues in 2002 

## Data Processing and Statistical Analysis ##
The fieldwork data were encoded in an Excel spreadsheet. The processing and statistical analysis of the data were done using the same Excel spreadsheet, R software (version R x 64 3.5.1) and QGIS software (version 2.18.18, extension LecoS 2.0.7).
We generated descriptive statistics, including mean, mode, standard deviation and coefficient of variation from the survey data. We performed the Shapiro and Kolmogorov tests to verify the normality and distribution of the data. We then compared the averages of the physicochemical parameters of the water points in the different watersheds based on an analysis of variance (ANOVA). To understand the influence of LULC parameters on water physicochemical quality, we used the Pearson correlation test and simple linear regression (SLR) models. Data with non-normal distribution were log transformed.

## Water Quality in Yangambi for the Main Domestic Water Supplies in the Different Watersheds ##
Most of the analyzed physical and chemical parameters of water from springs, rivers and cisterns in Yangambi meet WHO standards for drinking water. The exceptions are the acidic pH and turbidity values in surface water and unimproved water sampled from all the watersheds (Table

## Relationship Between the Physicochemical Quality of Stream Water Based on Indices of Landscape Configuration and Composition in Watersheds ##
The linearity analysis showed no significant linear relationships between the different water physicochemical parameters, except for turbidity and temperature, which showed a strong positive correlation (r = 92%). However, there were positive, nonsignificant relationships between almost all the variables of physicochemical water parameters.    Significant p-values are followed by an asterisk * for < 0.05 and *** for < 0.001.

The linearity analysis showed no significant linear relationships between the different water physicochemical parameters, except for turbidity and temperature, which showed a strong positive correlation (r = 92%). However, there were positive, nonsignificant relationships between almost all the variables of physicochemical water parameters. The exceptions were for temperature and dissolved oxygen, and also for conductivity and pH, where the linearity correlation was negative (Table 
The linear correlation test results between the different landscape indices (configuration and composition) and the different river water quality parameters revealed a significant correlation (p-value < 0.05), especially for turbidity, pH and temperature. However, almost all landscape indices were not significantly dependent (p-value > 0.05) on conductivity and dissolved oxygen, except for MPA_PF and MPA_CL, respectively. Only turbidity was negatively correlated with the proportion of DF and MPA of perturbed forests (Table 
The best SLR model, which explained the effect of each landscape parameter on different water physicochemical parameters, is that of pH as a function of ED-DF. Using this model, ED-DF explained up to 97% of the observed variability in pH (AIC, Akaike information criterion = -3.2; p-value > 0.05) (Table 
A simple forecast of precipitation and temperature for 30 years in the future (2050) was performed using the available data (Figures 

## Availability, Accessibility, Use and Management Capacity of Water Resources in Yangambi ##
Yangambi water supply points are located mainly around the urban-rural areas and villages. Nevertheless, several springs are located inside the forest, far from the residential areas. They were not considered in this study, as the Yangambi population barely uses them for water supply. There are only three wells, dug by the NRHS in Bangala, Likango and Ekutsu, but they are not operational. Cisterns are present exclusively in Isalowe, Lusambila and Lumumba (Isalowe, Lusambila and Loweo watersheds). These cisterns and wells are less than 1 km from settlements (Figure

Water is mainly used for domestic purposes in Yangambi, mostly for (i) toilets, (ii) bathing, (iii) dishwashing, (iv) laundry, (v) cooking and (vi) drinking. Water from streams, cisterns and rainfall is used less for drinking and cooking, and more for toilets, bathing, dishwashing and laundry. On the other hand, water from springs and streams is used for everything, with a preference for spring water for drinking. In some settlements and villages at larger distances from springs, such as Obiloto and Yanguma (in the Bonde watershed), people sometimes use water from rivers or rainwater for drinking. Most households do not pretreat their water before using it for domestic purposes. Only a few households, especially in Isalowe and Lusambila, use clean cloths as filters, or purifying products such as chlorine, or boil drinking water before its use (Table 
The percentage of illiterate household heads was moderately low in all the watersheds, where the education level is, on average, limited to secondary school. The exceptions were in Loweo (where most household heads did not go beyond primary school), and in Lusambila and Isalowe (where several household heads attained university educations) (Table 
The five watersheds have a Water Poverty Index (WPI) score varying between 50% and 66% (Figure

## LULC Dynamics in the Yangambi Watersheds ##
Most of the five watersheds have DF as the highest proportion of LULC. The proportions of DF are much lower in the Isalowe and Lusambila watersheds, where they have a significant proportion of BSR, compared to Lobilo and Loweo watersheds. Analysis of the linear correlation between different landscape parameters in the five watersheds in Yangambi showed a negative relationship between the proportion of DF and most of the landscape parameters related to bare soil and residential, CL and GL. This means that as the PD of CL, ED of bare soil and residential and MPA of GL increase, the proportion of

## LULC Dynamics in the Yangambi Watersheds ##
Most of the five watersheds have DF as the highest proportion of LULC. The proportions of DF are much lower in the Isalowe and Lusambila watersheds, where they have a significant proportion of BSR, compared to Lobilo and Loweo watersheds. Analysis of the linear correlation between different landscape parameters in the five watersheds in Yangambi showed a negative relationship between the proportion of DF and most of the landscape parameters related to bare soil and residential, CL and GL. This means that as the PD of CL, ED of bare soil and residential and MPA of GL increase, the proportion of DF patches tends to decrease in the watersheds. The CL, BSR, GL and PF landscape parameters also change positively with those showing an increase in forest landscape fragmentation (ED and PD), but also a decrease in its proportion in Yangambi.
Brandt and colleagues confirmed these relationships in 2016 

## Water Quality in Yangambi According to WHO Standards ##
Apart from turbidity and pH, the physicochemical parameter analysis of the different Yangambi water points met WHO standards for drinking water 
Comparison of the averages of the physicochemical parameters of rivers did not show any significant difference between watersheds (p-value < 0.05), except for conductivity and turbidity (p-value <0.05). The significant differences observed between the averages for turbidity and conductivity between watersheds can be explained by LULC types in Yangambi. Mwayi and Naito in 2019 found that forest massifs in Malawi could reduce sedimentation caused by watershed runoff to supply major water points 

## Physicochemical Parameters of River Waters' Nexus Landscape Parameters in the Yangambi ##
The correlation analysis between different physicochemical parameters of rivers showed a positive relationship. The only exceptions were pH and conductivity-which were negatively correlated with each other-and temperature and dissolved oxygen (Table 
The positive correlation between turbidity and pH was not significant, but could still be linked to the ferralitic soil type predominating in Yangambi, which usually undergoes deep leaching 
Thus, as the proportion and MPA of DF increased, water at the watershed level became less turbid. A similar relationship with the proportion of DF was not significant, possibly due to other sources of variability not considered in this study. On the other hand, the increase in PD, MPA, ED, CL, bare soil and GL increased turbidity significantly.
The pH was positively influenced by almost all landscape parameters related to DF fragmentation, including ED_FD and PD_FD. These last two indices give an idea of the level of degradation of the DF cover. All landscape indices favoring other types of LULC (configuration and composition), other than those favoring DF, tend to make the pH of stream waters less acidic than those watersheds with high proportions of forests. This would explain why the Isalowe and Lusambila watersheds have less acidic pH and more turbid stream waters with high temperatures (Figure 
In a 2015 study 
In a 2015 study 
Three SLR models best explained the variability of the analyzed physicochemical parameters of river water according to landscape parameters by referring to the AIC. These models explain the variation in pH as a function of ED_PF (94%), ED_crop land (92%) and PD_DF (90%) (Table 

## Water Vulnerability and Climate Change in Yangambi ##
As previously discussed in the results section, it appears that different water supplies are used in Yangambi. In the old settlements constructed around the houses of INERA workers, especially in Lusambila and Isalowe, the presence of cisterns and improved water springs is noticeable. In the other watersheds (Bonde, Loweo and Lubilaie), people obtain water mostly from rivers and springs, even if these sources are not improved. Indeed, the history of Yangambi city shows that water collection infrastructures (mainly cisterns), inherited from the colonial period, are exclusively located in certain watersheds within the administrative districts of the INERA Yangambi city. These settlements are much closer to urban than rural areas. A similar situation is observed almost everywhere in sub-Saharan Africa, where lack of infrastructure is a major problem for water accessibility, especially in peri-urban and rural areas 
The spatial distribution of surveyed water points using GIS shows that water sources vary in the five watersheds. Although there are several water points in Yangambi, some are in the middle of the forest (in the YRB), far away from houses (Figure 
The surveys revealed that water resource management capacity in Yangambi is generally low, except for the Isalowe watershed, which exceeds the 50% score (Figure 
Similarly, in terms of the water resource use component (amount of water consumed per person per day), the Isalowe watershed has the highest score. This advantage is probably due to the water collection infrastructure-especially the cisterns, and the high density of springs and rivers close to homes (Figure

responsible for drought and flooding in the region. The availability and accessibility of water in this region is often compromised when irregularities and seasonality are not considered.

## Conclusions and Recommendations ##
This study aimed to analyze the vulnerability of domestic water resources in the Yangambi context. We based the assessment of the impact of LULC types on the physicochemical quality parameters of stream water and whether the population would be able to adapt to this vulnerability in the context of climate change. The physicochemical parameters of stream water within the watersheds showed that water for domestic use no longer meets WHO standards for drinking water. This situation is amplified by the conversion of DF cover to other types of land use (linked to anthropization). These practices, in turn, deteriorate physicochemical parameters such as turbidity, pH and temperature of stream water. Unfortunately, the population in Yangambi has a low capacity to manage this resource, which results in high vulnerability for climate change adaptation. This vulnerability is already apparent through climate parameters recorded at the INERA Yangambi meteorological station based in this area. Therefore, we recommend an analysis of the state of the water resource by watershed to determine the best options for water resource management in Yangambi. At the same time, an exhaustive hydrological data sampling is needed to understand the different types of LULC contributions to the variability of water resource quality in Yangambi. The installation of gauging stations at different rivers in Yangambi will be important for better monitoring of the water resource. Finally, the installation of infrastructures that can help supply water to the communities while preserving the DF within the YBR is a priority, as water quality and quantity highly depend on it. A qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the impact of LULC change on water resources' quality and availability would be interesting. It could consider detailed analyses of physicochemical (organic ions, major inorganic ions, trace elements, etc.) and biological parameters of water, as well as the variation of streamflow data within the YBR catchments.
