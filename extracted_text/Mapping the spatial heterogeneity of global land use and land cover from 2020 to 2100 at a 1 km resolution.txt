ABSTRACT:
A fine global future land use/land cover (LULC) is critical for demonstrating the geographic heterogeneity of earth system dynamics and human-earth interaction. In this study, we produced a 1 km global future LULC dataset that takes into account future climate and socio-economic changes as well as the impact of simulated results of the former year on temporally adjacent periods. By incorporating the variations in climatic and socio-economic factors, we differentiated LULC suitability probabilities for historical and future periods across representative SSP-RCP scenarios. then, by using an improved cellular automata model-PLUS to simulate the patch-level changes of various land classes, we iteratively downscaled water-basin-level LULC demands in various future scenarios to a spatial resolution of 1 km. Our dataset achieves a high degree of simulation accuracy (Kappa = 0.94, OA = 0.97, FoM = 0.10) and precisely captures the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of global LULC changes under the combined effects of climate change and socio-economic development. This robust and fine-scale LULC dataset provides valuable spatially-explicit information essential for earth system modeling and intricate dynamics between anthropogenic activities and the environment.

## Background & Summary ##
Land use and land cover (LULC) change reflects the intricate interaction between climate change and intensive human activities 
Early LULC projections mostly forecast global land use demands at subregional levels, which are generally obtained from integrated assessment models (IAMs) such as AIM (Asia-Pacific integrated model), modular applied general equilibrium tool (MAGNET), Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment (IMAGE), and Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM). For instance, AIM simulates future regional land use dynamics by categorizing the world into 17 geopolitical regions 
Cellular automata (CA) have proved to be efficient in allocating land use to more spatially-explicit details, which are capable of defining the rules of cell-to-cell transformation as well as their adaptive behaviors and thus simulating the complex geospatial patterns. By integrating with land use demands generated from IAMs, CA models are capable of simulating scenario-based gridded LULC datasets with a finer resolution (normally 1 km). For instance, Li et al. 
Moreover, existing practices of future land use allocation generally utilize historical baseline to simulate land use dynamics under representative SSP-RCP scenarios, overlooking the effects of the simulated results of the former year on subsequent ones 
This study aims to produce a gridded dataset of global LULC at 1 km × 1 km resolution under typical SSP-RCP scenarios from 2020 to 2100 by combining the Patch-generating Land Use Simulation (PLUS) model and GCAM. Firstly, we use GCAM to simulate global land use demand at the water-basin level and calibrate urban land use generated from GCAM by means of a multivariate regression method. Compared to other IAM models such as IMAGE and AIM, GCAM has its advantages in simulating the spatial heterogeneity of global LULC with a classification of 235 regions at the water-basin level, by taking into account the discrepant land cover patterns in different agro-ecological zones and diversified socio-economic levels of different geopolitical regions. Secondly, by using the PLUS model to simulate the patch-level changes of various land classes driven by future suitability probabilities, we allocate the regional land use demand in various future scenarios to a spatial resolution of 1 km × 1 km. Finally, we compare the gridded dataset for future LULC with existing land use products to validate the accuracy of the results. This new dataset guarantees consistency across different SSP-RCP scenarios at explicit spatial details. Moreover, compared to other LULC products for future periods, this gridded dataset fully incorporates the impact of simulated results on temporally adjacent simulations and enhances the fidelity by using future suitability probabilities for land use projection. The outcome of this study can greatly help improve the accuracy of simulating earth system dynamics and modeling human-earth interaction.

## Projection of LULC demand. ##
GCAM is an open-source, multi-sector coordinated IAM developed by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), which gains wide applications in modeling agriculture and land use 

## Downscaling of LULC demand on a water-basin scale. Spatially explicit LULC simulation models ##
provide a means to convey changes from macro to local scales 
The baseline LULC data, driving factor data, and restriction zone data used in the simulations are described as shown in Table 

## Data Records ##
The dataset generated in this study is on a global scale with a resolution of 1 km and encompasses a timespan from 2020 to 2100, which is publicly available on https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.23542860 
We also calculated Pearson correlation coefficients to further assess the spatial conformity between the simulated results and historical LULC data in 2020, considering both overall and subtype-specific LULC distributions (refer to Table 
Moreover, Figure 

## Suitability probability generated by driving factors for future periods. ##
In the simulation stage for future periods, we found that the LULC simulation derived from future suitability probability can effectively capture the influence of driving factors on LULC change. Using the forest in Southern Africa as a case, Figure 
Our analysis revealed that the future suitability probability has evolved from its historical counterpart due to the influence of future driving factors. Regions with lower suitability probabilities in the historical probability landscape (shown in blue in Figure 
We further examined the distribution of the driving factors that lead to the difference between historical and future suitability probability. Historically, the GDP level displayed noticeable national differences. Given Angola's higher historical economic level in comparison to Zambia (see Figure 

## Variations in global LULC changes across different SSP-rCP scenarios. The discrepancy in LULC ##
under various SSP-RCP scenarios is well reflected in the dataset produced in this study. By taking Southeast Asia as an example, Figure 
To illustrate the variations in grassland areas across different future scenarios, we concentrate our focus on the Tibetan Plateau, a representative steppe region (see Figure 
Along with this environmental shift, intensive animal husbandry is forecasted to persist in this region, which is characterized by a growing population with an unabated demand for animal products and feed. This interplay of socio-economic and environmental factors contributes to relative stability in grassland area extent, forestalling any drastic reductions.
Comparison with other LULC datasets. We compared the gridded dataset generated in this study to LUH2 
Selecting regions with comprehensive LULC types in China (FoM = 0.12), Africa (FoM = 0.08), and the United States (FoM = 0.11) as examples, we validated the simulation accuracy by comparing our simulation results (see Figure 
Figure 
into 32 regions for the downscaling process, we divided the world into 235 regions at the water-basin level. This approach provides a better representation of the spatial heterogeneity in LULC simulations, and facilitates more precise control over the allocation of LULC demand within each water basin. Secondly, we adopted an iterative simulation technique starting with the historical data from 2020 as the basis for modeling the LULC of the subsequent future period, which was then used as the foundation for the simulation of the next period. This iterative approach considers the spatial impact of previous LULC results on the simulation of subsequent periods. By limiting the spatial and temporal scope of the simulation, we were able to control the number of pixels undergoing changes within each water basin. These abovementioned strategies help prevent the uncontrollable expansion of changing pixels within larger regions over extended simulation periods, and thus avoid the aggregation of changing pixels in areas with high suitability probability (refer to Figure 

## Usage Notes ##
This study produced a global-scale LULC dataset that includes 6 LULC types with a 1 km resolution from 2020 to 2100 under different SSP-RCP scenarios. The dataset displays robust simulation accuracy across world regions at the water-basin level (FoM = 0.10, Kappa coefficient = 0.94, OA = 0.97), which can efficiently capture the differential impacts exerted by each SSP-RCP scenario on the future expansion of LULC. This LULC dataset is fully supportive for mapping the geospatial heterogeneity of future land use and can provide spatially-explicit data for simulating earth system dynamics and anthropogenic impacts on the environment.
Compared with existing global LULC datasets for future periods, our dataset gave full account to the variation in future suitability probability relative to its historical counterpart, and employed future driving factors to derive updated suitability probability for LULC expansion across different SSP-RCP scenarios. Moreover, we used the PLUS model, a CA model that is capable of modeling the expansion of multiple types of natural LULC Fig. 
Yet, this dataset still has some limitations. Compared with the natural LULC types, the correlation coefficient between the simulation results and the observed data for urban areas is relatively lower (see Table
