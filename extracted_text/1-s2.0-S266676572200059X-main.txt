ABSTRACT:
Groundwater is the main available freshwater resource and therefore its use, management and sustainability are closely related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, Land Use Land Cover (LULC) and climate change are among the factors impacting groundwater recharge. The use of land-use and climate data in conjunction with hydrological models are valuable tools for assessing these impacts on river basins. This systematic review aimed at assessing the integrated modeling approach for evaluating hydrological processes and groundwater recharge based on LULC and climate change. The analysis is based on 200 peer-reviewed articles indexed in Scopus, and the Web of Science. Continuous research and the development of context-specific groundwater recharge models are essential to increase the long-term viability of water resources in any basin. The long-term impacts of natural and anthropogenic drivers on river basin interactions require integrating knowledge and modeling capabilities across biophysical responses, environmental problems, policies, economics, social, and data.

## Introduction ##
Global freshwater extraction was estimated at 3.99 trillion m 3 in 2014 
Groundwater recharge and sustainability are critical challenges for the world's fastest-growing population areas, particularly the arid and semi-arid regions that depend on the resource for domestic, industrial, and agricultural needs. Therefore, the establishment of good groundwater management systems is crucial to achieving the SDGs. However, the effects of urbanization have been experiential in numerous ways such as runoff changes and drought, recharge of groundwater, scarcity of water due to increasing demand and others 
Climate change is one of the recent key hydrological research problems 
A detailed understanding of groundwater inputs and outputs is required to guide water management choices for future planning and policy. In addition to analytical regression equations 
Using a bibliometric review technique, Castillero et al. ( 
Groundwater recharge is controlled by a variety of elements including climate, vegetation, unsaturated area, flow mechanism and thickness of the aquifer 

## Materials and methods ##


## Design of the study ##
A systematic literature review was conducted to determine the usefulness of an integrated modeling strategy for predicting groundwater recharge under changing climate and land use land cover changes. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) was employed based on 

## Summary of literature selection ##
The systematic review process captured articles through some of the main repositories including, the Web of Science and Scopus. For the preliminary investigation, Boolean search in scientific research engines and platforms were utilized, with an emphasis on keywords such as integrated modeling, land use and land cover change, hydrological responses, climate change, groundwater recharge, and other specific known techniques (GIS, SWAT, MODFLOW, WETSPAS, and so on) at the local, regional, national, and global levels. In all, 3282 articles were obtained because of the searches executed through all sources. After excluding 1235 duplicate articles, a total of 2047 articles were left for screening, and a further 1347 articles were deleted after filtering titles and abstracts. The complete texts of 700 possibly suitable articles were reviewed to determine their relevance. After this stage of filtering, 500 papers were eliminated, allowing 200 for inclusion in the review. Articles that were more than 10 years of age were largely omitted from the list, with a focus on those connecting future land use and land cover changes and groundwater recharge to climate change, in keeping with the objectives of the review. The PRISMA flow chart (Fig. 
A random selection of review articles released in the last decade  were those considered for the analyses, it does not however include conference proceedings. The search was restricted to English-language peer-reviewed journal papers. The journals chosen had enough material regarding GW recharge modeling in connection to LULC, the majority of which indicated the possibility of modeling GW recharge or surface-groundwater interactions, as well as hydrological modeling. The collection included a total of 200 scholarly articles as shown in (Fig. 

## Summary and development of a catalogue ##
The number of scientific articles reviewed for this publication is from America, Africa, and Asia. Over 50 countries contributed 180 peerreviewed publications, with 61 from Africa, 49 from Asia, 43 from America, 24 from Europe, and 2 from Australia. Furthermore, there were 11 publications examined from Ghana, with 24, 21, 10, and 14 from the United States, China, Ethiopia, and India respectively. Fig. 
Between 2000 and 2021, the sum of published literature on the use of hydrological models to estimate land use land cover and climate change impact on the recharge of groundwater has seen an exponential rise (Fig. 

## Results and discussions ##


## Impact of Land Use Land Cover (LULC) and climate changes on hydrological processes ##
The two most important occurrences impacting water regimes globally are land-use and climatic changes 
Climate change may affect watershed hydrologic systems by altering temperature and precipitation regimes 
Climate change impacts on hydrologic processes such as surface runoff, streamflow, baseflow, and evapotranspiration have been documented in most parts of the world. 
Integrated modeling is needed to better understand how future climate and land-cover changes may affect watersheds in different regions. Most urban watersheds might benefit greatly from the use of finescale urban development predictions, downscaled climate projections, and process-based hydrologic models to produce insights for water resource managers. Simplified and integrated hydrological modeling, or distributed and theoretical modeling, are the integral parts of these approaches. 
The MIKE-SHE model was used by 
Existing information on LULC's long-term consequences on hydrology has been revealed by the use of hydrological models 

## Groundwater recharge under changing LULC and climate ##
Climate patterns and land-use changes have the potential to significantly alter hydrological processes, hence affecting groundwater supply and quality. While hydrological conditions will be modified by climate change, it will also affect groundwater resources indirectly via their interaction with surface water bodies 
Groundwater recharge can be estimated experimentally using isotope tracers 
Globally, remote sensing and GIS, and other approaches for groundwater assessment have been used for groundwater flow, and quantity 
Martínez-Retureta et al. ( 

## Change of LULC and their impact on hydrologic characteristics ##
Rainfall and groundwater base-flow influence streamflow, which is crucial for flood management 
Li and Fang (2021) used the Delta downscaling approach to examine climate change impacts on streamflow. Calibration of the model predicts projected minimum monthly temperature rises of 1.5 • C, 2 • C, and 3 • C for all RCPs (2.6, 4.5, and 8.5) respectively. Rainfall is expected to decline in the 2030s and then rise to 8.9%, 12.89%, and 13.9% in the three scenarios, while streamflow is anticipated to increase by 10.5%, 20.1%, and 23.2% from 2020 to 2093 under the three RCP scenarios. The authors reiterated dry season streamflow is also expected to decline by 1.1% and rise by 3.2% in the rainy season. 
Streamflow is anticipated to rise 0.5-4 times due to early snowmelt, and snow cover will be declining at lower altitudes and increasing at higher elevations by the end of the century. The water cycle is known to be affected by LULC processes and climate change. These findings   
Changes in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) may greatly affect a drainage basin's runoff characteristics, which in turn affects the area's surface and groundwater availability. It is noteworthy to estimate the influence of LULC change on runoff characteristics of the northern region in general and minor watershed levels (sub-basin levels) on groundwater hydrology. The SWAT model has also shown promise in analyzing the consequences of LULC change on hydrology. In East Africa, Ethiopian researchers 

## Conclusion ##
The systematic review examined a total of 200 papers on integrated modeling approaches and highlighted research trends, as well as the effects of LULC and climate change on groundwater recharge. This review has demonstrated that over the last few decades, advances in research have shown that groundwater recharge may be simulated using a variety of approaches and instruments. The systematic review revealed significant information on the effects of LULC, and climate change on groundwater recharge, which has implications for LULC planning. It demonstrates that the effect of climate change on aquifer recharging is reflected in declines in the water table because of temperature increases, rainfall variability, and increased evapotranspiration.
Several of the research examined used hydrological or hydrogeological models, as well as empirical statistical models and evapotranspiration models. Other researchers employed ecohydrological models to determine the relationship between climatic factors and groundwater levels. Numerous studies have been conducted that consider severe occurrences, such as the repercussions of harmful anthropogenic effects. Recent research has demonstrated the value of an integrated modeling strategy for evaluating the effect of land-use changes on water resources. The papers reviewed advocated for the use of a spatially explicit land-use simulation model in conjunction with a hydrological model as a useful tool for assessing the influence of landuse change and climate change on groundwater recharge. The reactions to LULC changes vary, indicating the need of conducting site-specific research to fully understand the consequences of LULC changes. Such research must measure the combined effects of several stressors, such as LULC, climate, landscape, and soil qualities. Finally, the findings of this research emphasize the need for integrated modeling for assessing changes in groundwater resources.
