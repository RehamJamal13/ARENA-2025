ABSTRACT:
While urbanization puts lots of pressure on green areas, the transition of green-to-grey surfaces under land use land cover change is directly related to increased land surface temperature-compromising livability and comfort in cities due to the heat island effect. In this context, we evaluate historical and future associations between land use land cover changes and land surface temperature in Dera Ghazi Khan-one of the top cities in Pakistan-using multi-temporal Landsat data over two decades . After assessing current land use changes and future predictions, their impact on land surface temperature and urban heat island effect is measured using machine learning via Multi-Layer Perceptron-Markov Chain, Artificial Neural Network and Cellular Automata. Significant changes in land use land cover were observed in the last two decades. The built-up area expanded greatly (874 ha) while agriculture land (-687 ha) and barren land (-253 ha) show decreasing trend. The water bodies were found the lowest changes (57 ha) and vegetation cover got the largest proportion in all the years. This green-grey conversion in the last two decades (8.7%) and prospect along the main corridors show the gravity of unplanned urban growth at the cost of vegetation and agricultural land (-6.8%). The land surface temperature and urban heat island effect shows a strong positive correlation between urbanization and vegetation removal. The simulation results presented in this study confirm that by 2032, the city will face a 5° C high mean temperature based on historical patterns, which could potentially lead to more challenges associated with urban heat island if no appropriate measures are taken. It is expected that due to land cover changes by 2032, ~60% of urban and peri-urban areas will experience very hot to hot temperatures (> 31.5°C). Our results provide baseline information to urban managers and planners to understand the increasing trends of land surface temperature in response to land cover changes. The study is important for urban resource management, sustainable development policies, and actions to mitigate the heat island effect. It will further asset the broader audience to understand the

## Introduction ##
Land use (LU)/land cover (LC) refers to the classification of landscape according to the natural elements and anthropogenic activities. Collectively, the terms are often used as LULC due to their interrelationship 
Cities are considered the locomotive of development. Development practices across the world have accelerated urbanization 
The high LST concentration is primarily influenced by both horizontal and vertical expansion 
To measure variations in LULC and LST in cities, geo-information technologies such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) are flourishing 
Although some previous studies have focused on the historical changes and future LULC scenarios in Pakistan and worldwide

(2) model LST and its association with spatial indices as NDVI and NDBI; (3) simulate future changes in LULC and LST for 2032; and (4) explore the impact of different LULC changes on LST and formation of UHI effect.

## Study area ##
The study area is situated in the southwestern district in Punjab province at the foothill of the Koh-e-Suleiman mountain range (Suleiman Range) 
The study area received a large population from the surrounding less developed areas in the past two decades mainly due to better quality of life, health care, education, and security reasons. Also, an influx of migrants from rural areas after the destructive flood event in 2010 brought significant changes in the existing LULC pattern 

## Methodology ##


## Data Collection and Pre-processing ##
For this research, the study period is considered as the years 2002, 2012, and 2022. In these two decades, three Multi-spectral Landsat Satellite data (for the years mentioned) are downloaded from the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) Earth Explorer archives to evaluate LULC changes and their association with LST. The Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) data are used for 2002 and 2012, and the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data are used for 2022. All the data are retrieved for March to prevent any influences of seasonal variations. Cloud coverage is set to a minimum scale of <10% for all Landsat images. However, it is notable that the cloud cover is nearly 0 % for all the used images of the study area. Additional details (metadata) regarding the images were retrieved from the USGS repository. Detailed information about the images is provided in Table 

## Classification of LULC and change detection ##
The Image Classification tool in ArcGIS 10.5 is used to classify the LULC map due to its straightforward processing approach and simpleto-use nature with higher accuracy in terms of LULC classification. Following other research in this field, we use the supervised classification based on the maximum likelihood technique-one of the most applied techniques for LULC classification. Under the supervised classification, the images are classified using spectral signatures that are provided through training samples. Landsat-5 TM imaging bands 1-5 and band-7 are utilized to classify different land use classes. It is noted that band 6 is rejected since it represents a thermal band. In the case of Landsat-8 OLI imagery, bands 1-7 are employed. To create the LULC maps, all bands are initially stacked in ArcGIS 10.5 software using the Image Analyst Tool. To attain the accurate LULC classification, Landsat surface reflectance-derived spectral indices, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) were utilized 

## Accuracy assessment of classified maps ##
The confusion matrix, also known as the error matrix, is used to measure the accuracy of the classified maps. The pixel's actual and expected identity information is explained in this matrix as suggested by 

## Retrieval of land surface temperature ##
The LST is calculated by employing the thermal bands of radiometrically and geometrically corrected earth observation data from Landsat satellite during 2002-2022 for the periods 2002, 2012, and 2022. Thermal data are retrieved from the Landsat sensors and stored as Digital Numbers (DN). Later, these DNs are transformed into LST using a four-step procedure described by 
Step 1 involves the conversion of DNs values to radiance utilizing the following Equation (1):
(1)
where. L λ represents spectral radiance for both Landsat 5 TM and 8 OLI images;
LMIN for Landsat 5 TM is 1.238 and 0.10033 for both thermal bands (Bands 10 and 11) of Landsat 8 OLI image.
LMAX represents the Landsat 5 TM as 15.30 and 22.00180 for both thermal bands (Bands 10 and 11) of the Landsat 8 OLI image.
Step 2 follows the conversion of the radiance above to satellite brightness temperature (BT) at sensors into degree Celsius as Equation 
Here, K1 and K2 reflect calibration constants given as 607.76 and 1260.56 accordingly for Landsat 5 TM. For Landsat 8, OLI images of K1 and K2 (both bands 10 and 11) are given as 
Step 3 involves the final step to calculate the LST by utilizing the following three Equations 3:
in which, LST reflects land surface temperature; TB represents satellite brightness temperature; λ represents the wavelength of emitted radiance with a peak discharge of 11.5 μm; ρ can be calculated by applying the following Equation (4), and ε offers the ground surface emissivity that can be calculated from proportion vegetation (PV) using Equation 
where.
h is Planck's constant (6.626 * 10-34 J s), σ is Boltzmann constant (1.380649 * 10-23 J/K), and c = velocity of light (2.998 * 108 m/s). Further,

## PV NDVI NDVImin NDVImax NDVImin ##
PV represents vegetation proportion calculated from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for all the respective years 
The LST drives from Landsat 8, bands 10, and 11 are then averaged to obtain the cumulative LST composite image using the Cell Statistics Spatial Analyst tool extension in ArcGIS 10.5 software.

## Land surface temperature classification in relation to LULC changes ##
To determine the relationship between LST and land cover changes over the past 20 years, if any, the LST is categorized into six different zones to better understand the temporal and spatial differences. The selection of LST threshold values to visualize clusters/zones, past literature, expert opinion, and study area characteristics were considered. We categorize the LST zones as very cold (<21.1°C), cold (21.1-<23.1°C), chilly (23.1-<25.1°C), cool (25.1-27.1°C), warmish (27.1-29.1°C), hot (29.1-<31.1°C), and very hot (> 31.1°C) 

## Land surface temperature in relation to spatial indices ##
Indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) have been linked to LST 
where NIR represents the Near-infrared band and R is the Red band of the satellite image. Landsat TM bands 4 and 3 are utilized to derive NDVI, while Landsat OLI bands 5 and 4 are used. The NDVI scale runs between -1 to +1, with a negative value of NDVI indicating water whereas positive NDVI indicates vegetation.
Except for NDVI, LST is significantly influenced by impervious surfaces. Hence, we also consider this parameter and represent it using the well-known NDBI. The following equation (Equation 

## ND I SWIR NIR SWIR NIR ##
where, SWIR represents the Short-wave Infrared band and NIR is the Near-infrared band of satellite images.
Utilizing the NDBI, we can determine the built-up areas using remotely sensed data. For Landsat TM and Landsat OLI, bands 5 and 6 are utilized for SWIR, respectively. Similarly, bands 4 and 5 are utilized from Landsat TM and Landsat OLI images for NIR, respectively. Similar to NDVI, the NDBI values lie between -1 to +1, with values closer to -1 reflecting lesser built-up and values closer to +1 showing a high density of built-up areas.
The association between LST and spatial indices is initially determined using single and multiple linear regression analysis 

## Simulating LULC projections for the year 2032 ##
Given the fact that LULC is spatially dynamic, their simulation necessitates the use of spatial techniques for guaranteeing long-term sustainability and addressing current and future development needs. By combining GIS and RS methodologies, precise spatial models such as the Multi-layer Perceptron-Markov Chain (MLP-MC) have been developed to properly simulate future LULC 
The projection is made using two sorts of data: dependent variables like the previous LULC changes estimated (transitional matrix) from Landsat images of 2012, and 2022 and independent variables including elevation, slope, distance from activity centers, distance from waterways, and proximity to road networks. The distances to activity centers, waterways, and roads are estimated using the Euclidian distance function in ArcMap software. Furthermore, the ALOS-PALSAR DEM (12.5 × 12.5 meters spatial resolution) is employed in ArcMap software to estimate the elevation and slope of the study area. The up-scaling procedure with mean aggregation rules (resampling function in ArcGIS) was used to homogenize the spatial resolution of DEM and Landsat images. The transition potential matrix is created using the aforementioned variables. A random sampling approach is used to collect the samples of LULC. The maximum iteration (1000) and neighborhood pixel (9 cells) are selected to automatically train the prediction model 

## Simulating LST projection for years 2032 ##
Under the global warming situation, increased LST in metropolitan areas is a matter of serious concern for urban planners and decision-makers as it would impact energy demands, compromise livability in cities, and has potential health-related challenges 
In this study, LST simulation is based on the LST data from 2002 to 2022. Using QGIS software, the study area is subdivided into 500 × 500 meters spatial grids (fishnet) to obtain the sample points. The said grid size is set with the minimum spacing range in mind where features of one point can significantly influence LST. The LST and LULC data from previous steps are utilized for the training of a Neural Network in Terrset in order to predict LST 
The regression analysis offers information on how well the target data set describes the variance in the output results. The closer the value of R is to 1, the perfect correlation between the output and target data is expected. The Graphic User Interface (GUI) is created to test the performance indication before implementing the network. After the network's performance metrics are reasonable, they are retained for prediction. During the evaluation, the values of R and MSE are reported as 0.8 and 0.5, respectively. Thus, LST for 2032 is simulated using the call-back function. The number of hidden layers is determined by numerous experiments depending on MSE and R values. These hidden layers are significant because they influence the outcomes by allowing the network to display non-linear behavior. Three hidden layers were chosen for the current study 

## Results ##


## Spatial-temporal heterogeneities in LULC ##
Two precise patterns are observed in terms of LULC classification (Figure 
Moving forward, Supplementary Figure 
One of the important aspects of LULC classification is its reliability and accuracy. Detailed accuracy assessment is performed by picking 210 ground truth points (GTP) for all years. Multiple sources were used to seek the accuracy assessment and their detail is given in section 2.2.1.   As the urban areas increased, so did the study area's temperature in the last two decades (Figure 

## LULC-wise LST discrepancies ##
As expected, the lowest temperature in comparison with other land use classes is recorded for water bodies over 2002-2022 and in the predicted scenario for 2032. Where 23°C is the mean temperature in 2002 for water bodies, the value remained almost the same in 2012. In 2022, however, the value jumped to 33°C (Figure 

## Exploring connections among LST, NDBI and NDVI ##
NDBI is used to identify the human settlements in land cover with few other essential features like roads, dams, canals, etc. 
As for the NDVI, a completely mirrored scenario can be seen. For instance, the variation of NDVI values can be analyzed based on the radiation absorbed by the red spectral area chlorophyll and reflectance near the infrared spectral area of NDVI the more vegetation there will be. However, Figure 
The relation between LST and NDVI for the study area during the last decade shows a disproportionate relation. In 2002, the highest concentration of NDVI values was between the 25 to 30°C range, with a low value of -0.2 to 0.2 (Supplementary Figure 
The relation between LST and NDBI shows the corresponding scenario of LST and NDBI. An evaluation of the linear relationship between NDBI and LST shows a positive association between both (Supplementary Figure

## Discussion ##
Sustainability in the long-term context requires informed planning and management in the face of environmental changes through space and time. In an anthropogenic activities-based climate change-induced warming world, rapid urbanization-led impervious surface in cities leads to land resource degradation and scorching heat, which creates challenging conditions in terms of health issues and energy use among many others
The historical city of D. G. Khan was the first of its kind gridded planned city in 1911 
In 1970, a flux of labor migration toward the middle east countries (e.g., the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia) 
A clear trend of decreasing NDVI and increasing NDBI (Figure 
Recently, the government developed several land-use policies and rehabilitation programs at the federal and provincial levels. Still, lack of political interest and insufficient urban governance are the main barriers to implementing these initiatives. In recent years, the government has launched a Billion Trees Tsunami program all over Pakistan to tackle green cover degradation in the country, which has important implications for urban climatic conditions 
Our results have shown that green spaces are insufficient to overcome the large urban footprint. Hence, the green cover should be introduced and preserved on large patches to overcome the impact of impervious surfaces. The city and divisional government should introduce strict policies to implement green space initiatives at a larger scale to overcome the LST effect. The predicted results of 2032 also indicated the tremendous increase of 4-5° C LST and UHI, which represents an alarming situation for urban dwellers and should be a matter of the highest concern for relevant authorities. 

## Conclusions and recommendations ##
This study leverages multi-temporal remote sensing data to track historical and predict future patterns of land use/cover changes, LST, and the association between them in a mid-country city that is a part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) under the One Road One Built project. The overarching goal of the study is to determine how changes in land use classes affected LST. The methods used in this study are quite effective in accomplishing the research objectives. The study area is divided into four LULC categories, such as water bodies, built-up land, bare land, and vegetation. Due to political and socio-economic considerations, the land cover classification revealed that built-up areas and water bodies increased by 8.7 and 0.6%, respectively, over the study period . In contrast, bare land and vegetation dropped by 2.5 and 6.8%, respectively.
Furthermore, the study determines a negative association of vegetation area (NDVI) and water bodies with LST. The LULC significantly influences the LST and is extremely sensitive to vegetation and soil moisture; vegetation is the most important element in this connection. Although there is a positive association between NDBI and LST, higher LST is reported in areas with less vegetated (barren land) and vice versa. We conclude that without proper measures, a tremendous increase in the impervious surface is expected at the cost of green areas, which could potentially compromise the livability and comfortability of cities in the wake of global warming. This situation would very well lead to the UHI effect influencing millions of people in terms of increased energy demands and health-related challenges.
In order to cope with this increasing LST situation, green urban design and infrastructure planning and development must be prioritized. Similarly, enhancing water features like lakes, canals, waterfalls, and public fountains along with significantly increasing green areas like artificial parks, green walls, gardens, and linear plantings, particularly woody plants could positively drive the UHI mitigation efforts. In addition, to achieve the intended ecological development in terms of environmental resource planning and management, LULC alteration activities should be minimized, and environmental education should be reawakened. The findings of this study have important implications for urban landscape planning, particularly when it comes to landscape connectivity between green and impervious surfaces and their impact on LST. All of these would result in science-based information having important implications for urban planning and land resource management along with providing opportunities to design appropriate action plans to mitigate the UHI effect.

## Limitations and future works ##
The present study provides important and useful information for the study area to design proper adaptation and mitigation policies and action plans. Such actions at local levels would progressively contribute to regional sustainability from a bottom-up perspective. From a short-to-medium-term impact perspective, predicting future changes in LULC and how it will influence the LST under environmental changes provides key references for planning and management of the land resource in a more sustainable way along with providing opportunities for adaptation and mitigating climate change through local actions. Future urban studies could concentrate on the topic of rapid urbanization's impact on public health and infrastructure along with the influence of predicted LST on health-related issues in urban societies-left for upcoming studies. Future research should address the following limitations. Higher-resolution images for LULC categorization may improve LULC composition-LST correlation explanation and urban planner usability. Urban morphology is needed to better understand the nonlinear association between LULC and LST in urban areas. For more conclusive LST prediction findings, other nonlinear regression approaches may need to be investigated. This study used temperature indices to analyze LST; multi-season analysis will provide more information. Although LULC is a primary influence in LST variation, other characteristics affecting LST, most likely topography and elevation, are equally essential. In commercial/ industrial locations, surface morphology also effects surface temperature retrieval. More precise spatial distribution information
