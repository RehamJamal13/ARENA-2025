ABSTRACT:
Land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes in the Gidabo basin, Rift Valley, Ethiopia, have greatly affected the hydrology of the basin. This study integrates hydrological modelling with statistical analysis to evaluate the hydrological response of LULC changes during the period 1988-2018. Using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) models, the influences of individual LULC changes on different components of the hydrological cycle are assessed. The results of the Mann-Kendall test showed no significant trends in annual rainfall over the basin at the 95% significance level. Change in LULC resulted in an increase in annual mean surface runoff by 23.6 mm during the period 1988-2018. Meanwhile, the annual mean baseflow, lateral flow, percolation and evapotranspiration (ET) were reduced by 9.1, 4.2, 10.2 and 12.2 mm, respectively. PLSR analysis indicated that cultivated land affected the lateral flow and ET negatively in contrast to agroforestry and grassland, which had a positive influence.

## Introduction ##
Water is one of the most important natural resources on which all living things thrive. It goes through a system of circulation among ocean, atmosphere and land, known as the hydrological cycle 
Hydrological models are generally used to evaluate the effects of LULC changes on hydrological processes. These models simulate the spatial as well as temporal responses of various LULC changes on the hydrological components in a river basin 
In addition to quantifying the impacts of gross LULC changes on hydrological components using a hydrological model, it is also important to scrutinize the effect and contribution of each LULC change on different hydrological components of a catchment 
In Ethiopia, anthropogenic activities have affected the availability of water resources in river basins 

## Study area ##
The Gidabo watershed (Fig. 

## Data availability ##
The dataset required for the SWAT model setup includes a digital elevation model (DEM), soil map, LULC map and the climate data. The Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) DEM from the US Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Explorer (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov), with 30 m Ã— 30 m resolution, was processed in ArcGIS and used in this study. Images from the Landsat satellite (Table 
The SWAT model requires daily meteorological data as input. Therfore, the daily precipitation data, and maximum and minimum daily temperature data, for eight stations from 1987 to 2018 were obtained from the National Meteorological Services Agency of Ethiopia. After analysing the data, six rainfall stations and five temperature stations were selected. The observed daily streamflows of two gauging sites were obtained from the Ministry of Water, Irrigation and Electricity of Ethiopia for model calibration and validation. Finally, all the input data for the study basin were processed for input to the SWAT model.

## Methodology adopted ##


## Trend and change-point analysis ##
Assessing the presence of trends in hydro-climatological variables is vital for distinguishing and understanding changes in hydrological elements 

## Image classification and LULC change detection ##
For LULC change detection, Landsat images were first preprocessed to enhance the quality and visibility of features 
Ground truth points of 191 locations were utilized for accuracy assessment of the images from 2018. However, for the images from 1988 and 2000, 149 and 155 reference data, obtained from Google Earth, were used. Overall accuracy and Kappa statistics, derived from the error matrix, were used to evaluate the accuracy. ERDAS 2018 and ArcGIS 10.5 were used for image classification and mapping. The LULC maps for the years 1988, 2000 and 2018 are shown in Fig. 
where ChangeRate is the rate of change (km 2 /year); A is the area of LULC (km 2 ) at time t -2; B is the area of LULC (km 2 ) at time t -1; and Z is the time interval between A and B (years).

## Description of the SWAT model ##
SWAT is a semi-distributed physically based simulation model that can predict the effect of climate and anthropogenic alterations on the hydrological systems in watersheds with varying soils, land-use and management conditions over long periods 
where SW t is the final soil water content (mm), SW 0 is the initial soil water content on day i (mm), t is the time (d), R d is the amount of precipitation on day i (mm), Q s is the amount of surface runoff on day i (mm), E a is the amount of evapotranspiration on day  

## Set-up and calibration of the SWAT model ##
The model SWAT Version 2012 
In line with the suggestion of 

## Model application ##
To evaluate the effects of LULC changes on hydrological components at basin and sub-basin scales, simulations with the calibrated SWAT model were carried out by separately considering the LULC maps for the years 1988, 2000 and 2018 as inputs to the model.

## PLSR model ##
The PLSR technique is an extension of multivariate analysis, which combines the features of principal component analysis and multiple regressions 
Assessing the hydrological responses using the hydrological model is not done to reveal the relationship of individual LULC classes with, or their influence on, components of the water budget 
where a is the regression coefficient for the intercept and b is the regression coefficient for variables 1, . . ., n, computed from the data. Here, the dependent variables represent the changes in the surface runoff, water yield, base flow, lateral flow, percolation and evapotranspiration, while the independent variables represent the changes in the cultivated land, evergreen forest, agroforestry, grassland, shrubland and urban area. Furthermore, the degree of influence of independent variables on dependent variables is explained by the variable importance in the projection (VIP) 
Initially, the multicollinearity of the LULC classes was measured by tolerance and variable inflation factor (VIF) 

## Results and discussion ##
The results obtained with respect to the various analyses performed in the study are presented in this section.

## Trend and change-point analysis ##
The results of the MK trend test for annual rainfall at six stations in around the Gidabo watershed are summarized in Table 
The basin-wide areal rainfall trend showed no significant change in annual rainfall in the Gidabo watershed (Fig. 

## Evaluation of LULC change and accuracy assessment ##
The Landsat satellite images, in combination with unsupervised and supervised classification techniques, were used to map the LULC in the study watershed in the years 1988, 2000 and 2018, and, subsequently, changes in the LULC characteristics were calculated. Around 150 or more reference ground truth locations were used to assess the accuracy of the classification. The error matrix (Table 
The areal extent and rate of change of LULC in the Gidabo watershed are shown in Fig. 

## Calibration and validation of the model ##
Table 

## Hydrological responses to LULC changes at the basin level ##
The yearly mean basin estimates of surface runoff, water yield, baseflow, lateral flow, percolation and ET and their relative changes at the basin outlet, which have been estimated from the 1988, 2000 and 2018 LULC maps, are shown in Table 
The results for baseflow, lateral flow and percolation (Table 

## Response of hydrological components to LULC changes at the sub-basin level ##
The spatial distributions of the changes of major LULC classes and the yearly mean hydrological components between 1988 and 2018 are shown in 
The baseflow in 45 sub-basins demonstrated a decreasing pattern during 1988 and 2018, with the most significant reduction occurring in the southern and central parts of the basin. Meanwhile, the yearly average ET in all sub-basins decreased by 15.13 mm, with the most extreme decrease in the southern part of the basin (Fig. 
The sub-basin-level (Fig. 

## Influence of individual LULC changes on changes in hydrological components ##
A Pearson matrix of six LULC classes and six hydrological components is shown in Table 
Grassland is seen to have an excellent association with surface runoff, water yield, lateral flow and ET, with correlation coefficients of -0.47, -0.57, +0.50 and +0.62, respectively. In contrast, grassland has a relatively low correlation with baseflow (-0.21) and percolation (-0.21). The regression coefficient (Table 
Evergreen forest shows a high correlation with surface runoff, baseflow and percolation, with correlation coefficients of -0.33, +0.49 and +0.38, respectively. In contrast, evergreen forest shows a relatively low correlation with other hydrological components (Table 
In general, the surface runoff and water yield are profoundly related to change in the cultivated and urban areas. In contrast, baseflow, lateral flow, percolation and ET are negatively related to change in cultivated and urban areas. Moreover, baseflow, lateral flow, percolation and ET are highly positively related to alteration of evergreen forest, agroforestry and grassland, while surface runoff inversely correlates to alteration in these areas. The shrubland LULC classes also show a positive or negative impact on all hydrological components (Table 

## Conclusions ##
In this study, an attempt is made to assess the hydrological responses to LULC changes using the SWAT model and statistical analysis. The following conclusions can be derived from the study:
1. The MK test showed no significant trend in basin-wide annual rainfall during the study period  at the 95% significance level. The Pettitt test too could not detect any break in the basin-wide annual rainfall. Hence, any change in hydrological components during the study period  might be attributable to the effects of LULC changes. 2. An assessment of
