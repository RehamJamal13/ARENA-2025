ABSTRACT:
The present study, for the first time, examined land-use land cover (LULC), changes using GIS, between 2000 and 2018 for the IIT Bombay campus, India. Objective was to evaluate hydro-ecological balance inside campus by determining spatio-temporal disparity between hydrological parameters (rainfall-runoff processes), ecological components (forest, vegetation, lake, barren land), and anthropogenic stressors (urbanization and encroachments). High-resolution satellite imageries were generated for the campus using Google Earth Pro, by manual supervised classification method. Rainfall patterns were studied using secondary data sources, and surface runoff was estimated using SCS-CN method. Additionally, reconnaissance surveys, ground-truthing, and qualitative investigations were conducted to validate LULC changes and hydro-ecological stability. LULC of 2018 showed forest, having an area cover of 52%, as the most dominating land use followed by built-up (43%). Results indicated that the area under built-up increased by 40% and playground by 7%. Despite rapid construction activities, forest cover and Powai lake remained unaffected. This anomaly was attributed to the drastically declining barren land area (up to ~ 98%) encompassing additional construction activities. Sustainability of the campus was demonstrated with appropriate measures undertaken to mitigate negative consequences of unwarranted floods owing to the rise of 6% in the forest cover and a decline of 21% in water hyacinth cover over Powai lake. Due to this, surface runoff (~ 61% of the rainfall) was observed approximately consistent and being managed appropriately despite major alterations in the LULC. Study concluded that systematic campus design with effective implementation of green initiatives can maintain a hydro-ecological balance without distressing the environmental services.

## Introduction ##
India represents the third-largest higher education system in the world next to China and the USA 
The information on LULC in the form of statistical data and maps is an essential requirement for better utilization of land, spatial planning, and management 
Open-source digital platforms, such as Google Earth Pro, is commonly used for analyzing Earth observation data on land transformations. Google Earth Pro, released in 2004 (initially named as Earth Viewer 3D) by Keyhole Inc., a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) funded company acquired by Google, is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) tool. Based on satellite imagery, it provides a three-dimensional model of the Earth and two-dimensional geographical information via maps. The key feature of Google Earth Pro is that it provides a free high-resolution imagery database from different satellite platforms, such as CNES Airbus, Landsat, and Copernicus 
Several previous studies have extensively used Google Earth Pro for investigating and analyzing natural resources, hydrological balance, ecological stability, LULC changes, navigation, agricultural watersheds, geosciences, and archeological findings from across the globe 
Generating LULC classes using a manual supervised classification technique is yet another approach adopted in land transformation studies 
The number of universities is increasing and expanding in terms of land area to accommodate the increasing number of students by constructing a greater number of hostels in an academic institution. Therefore, understanding and quantifying the spatio-temporal dynamics of the institution's LULC changes and its driving factors are crucial to put forward the right policies and monitoring mechanisms for planners and policymakers 

## Study objectives ##
Dunbar and Acreman 
The aforementioned objectives require good quality and quantity of observation data. For example, good quality and quantity of rainfall data were acquired from the Regional Meteorological Center (RMC), located in Mumbai for the present study site; however, obtaining such data for other parameters, such as vegetation, forest cover, was challenging. In such instances, when observation data are limited, the use of RS data and GIS has been widely used to address data gaps. This paper presents an integrated study using secondary data, RS, GIS, and field observations for the IITB campus.

## Methods ##


## Study site ##
The IITB campus is located in the financial and commercial capital of India-Mumbai, between the Powai lake and Vihar lake region, at a geographical location between 19°8′01.09″N and 72°54′55.29″E (Fig. 

## Data collection and data processing ##
The data acquisition of the present research was based both on quantitative (secondary data-based) and qualitative (survey-based) research methods aiming to investigate LULC changes in the campus of IITB between 2000 and 2018. An open-source GIS platform-QGIS and satellite data from Google Earth Pro-was employed for developing LULC maps. Besides this, rainfall data and curve number data were also collected from secondary sources for estimating surface runoff and further analysis of the rainfall-runoff process.

## Rainfall (P) ##
The rainfall data (P), from 2000 to 2018, for the Santacruz region of Mumbai were collected from the RMC, Mumbai region 

## Remote sensing (RS) using Google Earth Pro ##
Considering the advantages of the manual classification of the high-resolution satellite imagery for a fine-scale study area, Google Earth Pro is used. The RS data were collected by developing a boundary map of the IITB campus by digitizing it in Google Earth Pro (as shown in insets of Fig. 
Due to the undulating topography of the study area, ground reference data were collected from Google Earth Pro with Ground Control Points (GCPs). As the total study area was small (~ 4.6 km 2 ), each LULC type was groundtruthed using the reconnaissance survey for accuracy assessment. The GCPs for thematic accuracy were collected near the boundary between different LULC classes, whereas GCPs for position accuracy were taken on easily recognizable elements in the satellite images, such as playground corners, building (built-up) edges, bank of Powai lake, and nursey corners. The OSMTracker (online Global Positioning System App) was used to validate the geographical locations. The accuracies of classification were observed better than expected. A negligible error was recorded in the overall accuracy of the classification image for the year 2018, wherein an overall accuracy ranging between 90 and 96% was obtained. Finally, based on these land-use classifications, a Google Earth KML file was obtained for each LULC type.

## QGIS processing ##
The KML files, obtained from Google Earth Pro, were postprocessed in QGIS to estimate the area. The steps included, (1) exporting the KML file to QGIS; (2) converting the KML file into shapefile; (3) generating a LULC image of the IITB campus by defining its boundary (legends) and by assigning different colors for different land uses. Six major LULC classifications were found in the ground survey, which was used for the RS imagery. Following these, LULC maps were generated for the years 

## Soil conservation services-curve number (SCS-CN) ##
The SCS-CN method, as developed by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Soil Conservation Service (SCS), primarily aimed at estimating rainfall excesses from rainfall 

## Runoff (R) and weighted curve number (WCN) estimations ##
Using the rainfall (P), area of each land cover type (A), and runoff curve number (CN) estimations, as described in Sects. 2.2, the runoff volume (R) was calculated as the product of P, A, and, CN. The WCN was calculated to determine the overall impact of different land uses over rainfallrunoff behavior inside the campus. For this, the total runoff volume (R 1,t + R 2,t + R 3,t + R 4,t ) from the major four land-use classifications viz., (1) built-up, (2) forest, (3) playground, and (4) barren land were considered, as they were primarily resulting into surface runoff. The R was calculated for each year (t) and divided with the corresponding annual rainfall (P t ) received in that particular year (t). With this, the value of WCN for all the mentioned years in the given study period was obtained.

## Qualitative and field investigations ##
The primary data were used in this study for understanding the nuances of the secondary data, given the behavior of rainfall-runoff components and associated measures being taken to manage the campus development initiatives. The purpose of bringing qualitative investigations in this study was to acquire field insights and understanding people's perception of the changing rainfall-runoff behavior. Key qualitative findings were included in the present study based on personal communication with the residents of the IITB campus (Achary and Yughabala, personal communication, March 9, 2020). Field investigations were conducted inside the campus, which included transect walks at the periphery of the Powai lake and reconnaissance survey, thereby creating social and resource maps indicating diverse land uses. The investigation primarily ground-truthed two facets viz., (1) ascertaining the socio-economic patterns impacting and regulating provisions for groundwater percolation (from green cover) and surface runoff (from built-up cover) and (2) understanding the distinctions of green cover in terms of vegetation, forest cover, and barren land with infrastructural development.

## Results ##


## Rainfall-runoff analysis ##
The average annual rainfall in the study period was recorded to be 2,331 mm, with a maximum rainfall observed in the year 2011 (3,129 mm) and the least rainfall received in the year 2015 (1,800 mm) (Fig.

## Water hyacinth cover and its impact over the Powai lake ##
The analysis of Powai lake, having an area of about 2.34 km 2 , was based on the visible area under satellite imagery for water cover (lake) and the WH cover between 2000 and 2018 (Fig. 

## Comparative analysis between LULC for 2000 and 2018 ##


## Runoff versus built-up change ##
To understand the rainfall-runoff behavior of the entire campus, the value of WCN was calculated and compared with the built-up cover of the IITB campus. The depth of the runoff (in mm) was used in the estimation of the WCN based on the magnitude of the rainfall (in mm) received each year. The value of WCN was observed fluctuating in the range of 36 to 40 (averaging 39) with an overall decreasing trend across the study period (Fig. 

## Discussions ##


## Status and plans of infrastructure development post-2018 ##
The rapid expansion in student numbers resulted in an increase in infrastructure activities within the campus. The population of students increased from about 5500 in 2008 to nearly 11,000 in 2020 (Fig. 
To accommodate all the students and staff, additional buildings were needed. The institute planned to construct new hostels by targeting to bring more than 2,000 additional rooms for non-married students and 400 rooms for married students by the year 2022 

## Key observations from field investigation ##
Given the context of minimizing flash flood events together with enhancing green cover amidst rapid infrastructural development, field investigation and qualitative surveys were conducted inside the IITB campus. Findings from the investigation revealed that the construction of any building was preceded by surveying the total vegetation and tree losses that could occur after the construction. Such losses of greenery were more or less compensated by additional plantation of the trees either in the vicinity of the constructed building or in the nearby gardens (Fig. 

## Status and recommendations for sustainable campus development ##
The fact claimed by the website of IITB -"…the campus' green cover has been maintained and even increased over the years" 
Besides student-run bodies, institute-level committees were formed to address the prevailing issues focusing on the implications of the rainfall-runoff behavior, and impacts of the rapid built-up growth on campus ecology. This included the Green Campus Initiative (GCI) committee established in 2010 

## Learnings from past studies ##
There are yet studies that focused on spatio-temporal variation of landscape patterns, wherein they considered complex interactions of social, economic, demographic, technological, political, biophysical, and cultural factors, for example Behera et al. 

## Future scopes ##
The developing campuses are more vulnerable to rapid LULC changes, in case, not enough consideration is given in devising sustainable strategies for overall holistic campus development. Based on the results and discussions, this study proposes to focus on the following attributes in future investigations for the IITB campus:
• In order to develop a green model, holistic approaches are further needed to improving sectors like solid waste management (to eradicate landfills), wastewater management (to reduce water hyacinth cover in Powai lake; invading as a result of the discharge of the wastewater), smarter and greener buildings (to install rainwater harvesting coupled with roof-top plantation making maximum utilization of rainfall and minimizing runoff ), etc. Similar initiatives with characteristics like lower carbon footprint 
• Since the land-use classes are generated by the manual classification method, the accuracy associated with the satellite imagery cannot be assessed using the Kappa coefficient and user's and producer's accuracies of individual classes. Future research should consider applying supervised classification for image processing and interpretation that can better differentiate between vegetation cover, barren land, and the forest (cover) leaves. A maximum-likelihood algorithm could be employed to detect the land-use classifications. The primary three geoprocessing tools, viz., create accuracy assessment points, update accuracy assessment points, and compute confusion matrix, can be employed to generate an accuracy assessment report. 

## Summary and conclusions ##
The present study, for the first time, examined the changes in the land-use land cover (LULC) pattern of the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) campus from the period of 2000 to 2018 using remote sensing data and Geographical Information System. Parameters, such as greenery (vegetation and forest), water hyacinth (WH) cover in Powai lake, and other land uses and their impacts over the rainfall-runoff process, were studied and analyzed. The analysis was based on the simplified mass balance algorithms that can be used by land managers with less training efforts. Results indicated that the LULC change was major in the case of built-up, barren land, Powai lake, and the WH cover, while the LULC change observed was minor in the case of the forest cover and playground. The infrastructural development (built-up), including academic building, hostels, and roads, drastically increased in the study period, and the expansion of the built-up cover, in terms of the area, mostly happened through available barren land without interfering with the forest cover. The overall WH cover decreased significantly from 0.9 km 2 in 2000 to 0.4 km 2 in 2018 in the Powai lake, due to the aesthetics aspect of Hiranandani settlements, but the WH on the IITB's side was not much improved since 2000. Hiranandani was a tourist place, and thus, to maintain its tourism, the Powai lake at this zone was substantially maintained, which gradually reduced the WH cover to null in the year 2018, thereby bringing back the lake to its initial coverage. The number of trees on the campus of IITB recorded a fluctuating increase, thus improving the green cover on the campus. As a result, a fluctuating slighter decrease in runoff volume to Powai lake was observed despite the rapid rise in the built-up area. This happened because of the increase in the number of trees in the gardens of all buildings and along both sides of the major and minor roads including the surrounding area of the Powai lake. The various student-run social and technical bodies along with administrative and institute committees of IITB have taken appropriate measures to maintain the green cover within the campus, which resulted in keeping the check over high runoff discharge. This paper further summarized how the infrastructural development in IITB has changed the LULC pattern and documented the potential impacts of the same on the green cover, runoff patterns and hydrological balance inside the campus. Lessons learned from substantial LULC change assessments can lead to sustainable design for eco-friendly LULC which could be an alternative for any campus. Based on the major findings from the present study, the following conclusions were drawn:
• The IITB campus and its surrounding region witnessed more rainfall than the average annual rainfall of Mumbai. It was observed during field observation and remote sensing studies that the forest (green) cover was the most dominating land use inside campus, coupled with the presence of the national park in the campus vicinity. It can be concluded that the green cover caused higher rainfall in the region. Therefore, careful management strategies, through the lens of green campus initiatives, for controlling events of flash flood amidst new constructions become obligatory. • Removal of the water hyacinth from Powai lake, though appeared challenging, was achievable given the fact that the Hiranandani complex was able to clear it to a considerable extent. Therefore, the maintenance aspects of the lake not only needed higher prioritization but also needed the participatory-based involvement of diverse stakeholders.
• Despite rapid construction activities, the events of flash floods (due to higher runoff ) within the campus remained dormant. Apart from appropriate water routing and discharging surplus runoff into Powai lake, it was concluded that the forest cover, or more specifically the greater density of the trees, caused higher infiltration of the rain against surface runoff. • The evidence that the weighted curve number unevenly declined across the study period against the increasing built-up cover concluded that the systematic campus design, with effective implementation of the green initiatives, can maintain hydro-ecological balance without compromising with the environmental services.
• The study finally concluded that the limited land availability for future constructions must be coupled with exploring appropriate strategies for sustainable and eco-friendly constructions, given the threat to the green cover. Green technologies, such as roof-top plantation and green building conceptions, could be employed for creating additional green spaces inside the campus.
