"Land use and land cover change detection and prediction in Bhutan's high altitude city of Thimphu, using cellular automata and Markov chain","Rapid urbanization is changing landscapes often resulting in the degradation of ecosystem services and quality of urban life. Remote sensing and GIS tools can provide valuable information to deepen our understanding of the dynamics of these changes to better plan and build sustainable cities for the future. Using remote sensing data, socio-economic data, and field observations, we simulated spatiotemporal dynamics of land use and land cover changes in the city of Thimphu. Simulation results reveal that the landscape of Thimphu city has changed considerably during the study period and the change trend is predicted to continue into 2050. The study observed a significant increase (12.77%) in built-up area from 2002 (52.88%) to 2018 (65.5%), followed by a slight increase in the cover of bare ground. On the contrary, forest cover declined drastically (15.25%) followed by agriculture (1.01%). Rapid population growth triggered by rural urban migration coupled with hasty socio-economic development post democracy are the main drivers of these changes. These changes have fragmentated forest cover, increased soil/gully erosion, surface runoff, and storm induced floods of storm and sanitation drains, thereby impinging on the overall quality of life in the city. Under the business as usual scenario, prediction analysis for the year 2050 show that built up area will consume almost all of the city area (73.21%) with forest significantly reduced to patches making up only about 16% of the city. These findings beg for an urgent need to implement effective planning specially to protect the existing forest and water resources from further degradation."
Environmental & Socio-economic Studies,"Land-use change is a human process aimed at transforming the natural landscape and emphasizing the role and function of land for socio-economic activities. However, we do not know how the land transition in Vietnam has been proceeding recently. Thus, this article aims to examine the current urbanization process of land conversion in Vietnam. To explore the current situation and recent change of land use, the author analyzed standardized databases and maps from reports of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of Vietnam (MoNRE), the General Statistics Office of Vietnam (GSO), and the land cover map of Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). Research results show that the land transition in Vietnam has been similar to the world trend. The highest land conversion rate occurs in the North Central and Central Coast regions, but conversion of agricultural land for urbanization is mainly in the Red River Delta and Southeast. The study also noted some negative socio-economic impacts of land conversion on the lives of suburban residents."
Land-use change and biodiversity: Challenges for assembling evidence on the greatest threat to nature,"Land-use change is considered the greatest threat to nature, having caused worldwide declines in the abundance, diversity, and health of species and ecosystems. Despite increasing research on this global change driver, there are still challenges to forming an effective synthesis. The estimated impact of land-use change on biodiversity can depend on location, research methods, and taxonomic focus, with recent global metaanalyses reaching disparate conclusions. Here, we critically appraise this research body and our ability to reach a reliable consensus. We employ named entity recognition to analyze more than 4000 abstracts, alongside full reading of 100 randomly selected papers. We highlight the broad range of study designs and methodologies used; the most common being local space-for-time comparisons that classify land use in situ. Species metrics including abundance, distribution, and diversity were measured more frequently than complex responses such as demography, vital rates, and behavior. We identified taxonomic biases, with vertebrates well represented while detritivores were largely missing. Omitting this group may hinder our understanding of how land-use change affects ecosystem feedback. Research was heavily biased toward temperate forested biomes in North America and Europe, with warmer regions being acutely underrepresented despite offering potential insights into the future effects of land-use change under novel climates. Various land-use histories were covered, although more research in understudied regions including Africa and the Middle East is required to capture regional differences in the form of current and historical land-use practices. Failure to address these challenges will impede our global understanding of land-use change impacts on biodiversity, limit the reliability of future projections and have repercussions for the conservation of threatened species.
Beyond identifying literature biases, we highlight the research priorities and data gaps that need urgent attention and offer perspectives on how to move forward."
Land Use/Land Cover Changes and Their Driving Factors in the Northeastern Tibetan Plateau Based on Geographical Detectors and Google Earth Engine: A Case Study in Gannan Prefecture,"As an important production base for livestock and a unique ecological zone in China, the northeast Tibetan Plateau has experienced dramatic land use/land cover (LULC) changes with increasing human activities and continuous climate change. However, extensive cloud cover limits the ability of optical remote sensing satellites to monitor accurately LULC changes in this area. To overcome this problem in LULC mapping in the Ganan Prefecture, 2000-2018, we used the dense time stacking of multi-temporal Landsat images and random forest algorithm based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The dynamic trends of LULC changes were analyzed, and geographical detectors quantitatively evaluated the key driving factors of these changes. The results showed that (1) the overall classification accuracy varied between 89.14% and 91.41%, and the kappa values were greater than 86.55%, indicating that the classification results were reliably accurate. (2) The major LULC types in the study area were grassland and forest, and their area accounted for 50% and 25%, respectively. During the study period, the grassland area decreased, while the area of forest land and construction land increased to varying degrees. The land-use intensity presents multi-level intensity, and it was higher in the northeast than that in the southwest. (3) Elevation and population density were the major driving factors of LULC changes, and economic development has also significantly affected LULC. These findings revealed the main factors driving LULC changes in Gannan Prefecture and provided a reference for assisting in the development of sustainable land management and ecological protection policy decisions."
"Application of Remote Sensing Tools to Assess the Land Use and Land Cover Change in Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, Mexico","Land use and land cover (LULC) change has become an important research topic for global environmental change and sustainable development. As an important part of worldwide land conservation, sustainable development and management of water resources, developing countries must ensure the use of innovative technology and tools that support their various decision making systems. This study provides the most recent LULC change analysis for the last six years (2015-2021) of Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, Mexico, one of the most important petrochemical cities in the world and host of the ongoing Interoceanic Corridor project. The analysis was carried out using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite images, ancillary data and ground-based surveys and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to identify and to ameliorate the discrimination between four main macro-classes and fourteen classes. The LULC classification was performed using the maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) to produce maps for each year, as it was found to be the best approach when compared to minimum distance (MDM) and spectral angle mapping (SAM) methods. The macro-classes were water, built-up, vegetation and bare soil, whereas the classes were an improved classification within those. Our study achieved both user accuracy (UA) and producer accuracy (PA) above 90% for the proposed macro-classes and classes. The average Kappa coefficient for macro-classes was 0.93, while for classes it was 0.96, both comparable to previous studies. The results from the LULC analysis show that residential, industry and commercial areas slowed down their growth throughout the study period. These changes were associated with socioeconomical drivers such as insecurity and lack of economic investments. Groves and trees presented steady behaviors, with small increments during the five-year period. Swamps, on the other hand, significantly degraded, being about 2% of the study area in 2015 and 0.93% in 2021. Dunes and medium and high vegetation densities (∼ 80%) transitioned mostly to low vegetation densities. This behavior is associated with rainfall below the annual reference and increments of surface runoff due to the loss of vegetation cover. Lastly, the present study seeks to highlight the importance of remote sensing for a better understanding of the dynamics between human-nature interactions and to provide information to assist planners and decision-makers for more sustainable land development."
Detecting land use and land cover change on Barbuda before and after the Hurricane Irma with respect to potential land grabbing: A combined volunteered geographic information and multi sensor approach,"Two months after the hurricanes Irma and Maria hit Barbuda, the construction of a new international airport led to accusations of degrading the Codrington Lagoon National Park and contravening the conventions of the Ramsar Program. Scientists have analyzed the aftermath with respect to historical legacies, disaster capitalism, manifestation of climate injustices and green gentrification. The main objective of this study was to quantify and allocate land use and land cover change (LULCC) in Barbuda before and after the 2017 Hurricane disasters. Remote sensing data and volunteered geographic information were analyzed to detect the potential changes in natural LULC so that human activities and the emergence of artificial surfaces could be detected. Human-induced LULCC occurred at different sites on the island, with decreased activities in Codrington, but increased and continued activities at Coco and Palmetto Points. With an accuracy of 97.1 %, we estimated a total increase of vegetated areas by 6.56 km 2 , and a simultaneous slight increase in roads and buildings with a total length of 249.67 km and a total area of 1.43 km 2 . The vegetation condition itself depict a steady decrease since 2017. New hotspots of human activity emerged on the island in the Codrington Lagoon National Park."
Land Use and Land Cover Change Modeling and Future Potential Landscape Risk Assessment Using Markov-CA Model and Analytical Hierarchy Process,"Land use and land cover change (LULCC) has directly played an important role in the observed climate change. In this paper, we considered Dujiangyan City and its environs (DCEN) to study the future scenario in the years 2025, 2030, and 2040 based on the 2018 simulation results from 2007 and 2018 LULC maps. This study evaluates the spatial and temporal variations of future LULCC, including the future potential landscape risk (FPLR) area of the 2008 great (8.0 M w ) earthquake of south-west China. The Cellular automata-Markov chain (CA-Markov) model and multicriteria based analytical hierarchy process (MC-AHP) approach have been considered using the integration of remote sensing and GIS techniques. The analysis shows future LULC scenario in the years 2025, 2030, and 2040 along with the FPLR pattern. Based on the results of the future LULCC and FPLR scenarios, we have provided suggestions for the development in the close proximity of the fault lines for the future strong magnitude earthquakes. Our results suggest a better and safe planning approach in the Belt and Road Corridor (BRC) of China to control future Silk-Road Disaster, which will also be useful to urban planners for urban development in a safe and sustainable manner."
"Assessing the Effect of Land-Use and Land-Cover Changes on Discharge and Sediment Yield in a Rural Coal-Mine Dominated Watershed in Kentucky, USA","The Appalachian Mountain region of eastern Kentucky is unique and contains high proportions of forestland along with coal and natural gas depositaries. Landscape changes due to extreme mining activities can eventually threaten the downstream ecosystems, including soil and water quality, resulting in excessive runoff and sedimentation. The purpose of this study is to assess the impacts of land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes in streamflow and sediment yield in Yellow Creek Watershed, Kentucky, USA, between 1992 and 2016. LULC, digital elevation model, soil, and weather data were inputted into the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate discharge and sediment yield. The model output was evaluated on several statistical parameters, such as the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR), percent bias (PBIAS), and the coefficient of determination (R 2 ). In addition, two indices, P-factor and R-factor, were used to measure the prediction uncertainty. The calibrated model showed an increase in surface runoff and sediment yield due to changes in LULC in the Yellow Creek Watershed. The results provided important insights for studying water management strategies to make more informed land management decisions and adaptive practices."
Impacts of land use and land cover change in response to different driving forces in Uganda: evidence from a review,"This reviewe of Land Use Land Cover Change (LULCC) studies in Uganda indicate agriculture, forest, grassland, and woodland as the major land use and land cover types. Central Uganda is the most studied region (15%), followed by western ("
"Vegetation Trends, Drought Severity and Land Use-Land Cover Change during the Growing Season in Semi-Arid Contexts","Drought severity and impact assessments are necessary to effectively monitor droughts in semi-arid contexts. However, little is known about the influence land use-land cover (LULC) has-in terms of the differences in annual sizes and configurations-on drought effects. Coupling remote sensing and Geographic Information System techniques, drought evolution was assessed and mapped. During the growing season, drought severity and the effects on LULC were examined and whether these differed between areas of land change and persistence. This study used areas of economic importance to Botswana as case studies. Vegetation Condition Index, derived from Normalised Difference Vegetation Index time series for the growing seasons (2000-2018 in  comparison to 2020-2021), was used to assess droughts for 17 constituencies (Botswana's fourth administrative level) in the Central District of Botswana. Further analyses by LULC types and land change highlighted the vulnerability of both human and natural systems to drought. Identified drought periods in the time series correspond to declared drought years by the Botswana government. Drought severity (extreme, severe, moderate and mild) and the percentage of land areas affected varied in both space and time. The growing seasons of 2002-2003, 2003-2004 and 2015-2016  were the most drought-stricken in the entire time series, coinciding with the El Niño southern oscillation (ENSO). The lower-than-normal vegetation productivity during these growing seasons was evident from the analysis. With the above-normal vegetation productivity in the ongoing season (2020-2021), the results suggest the reversal of the negative vegetation trends observed in the preceding growing seasons. However, the extent of this reversal cannot be confidently ascertained with the season still ongoing. Relating drought severity and intensities to LULC and change in selected drought years revealed that most lands affected by extreme and severe drought (in descending order) were in tree-covered areas (forests and woodlands), grassland/rangelands and croplands. These LULC types were the most affected as extreme drought intersected vegetation productivity decline. The most impacted constituencies according to drought severity and the number of drought events were Mahalapye west (eight), Mahalapye east (seven) and Boteti west (seven). Other constituencies experienced between six and two drought events of varying durations throughout the time series. Since not all constituencies were affected similarly during declared droughts, studies such as this contribute to devising appropriate context-specific responses aimed at minimising drought impacts on social-ecological systems. The methodology utilised can apply to other drylands where climatic and socioeconomic contexts are similar to those of Botswana."
Assessing Land Use-Land Cover Change and Its Impact on Land Surface Temperature Using LANDSAT Data: A Comparison of Two Urban Areas in India,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the spatial and temporal changes in land use and patterns of vegetation and its impacts on land surface temperature (LST) in two Indian cities. Specifically the motivation behind this study is to examine whether a correlation exists between these parameters for the two cities. Indian cities are facing tremendous pressures of rapid urbanization altering the country's land use patterns. This in turn has significantly altered the country's land surface temperature over the years. This study investigates the changes in the land use, land cover and surface temperature in two Indian cities of Surat and Bharuch over a period of 2 decades using Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS datasets. The study also examines changes in vegetation pattern during this period using a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and investigates the correlation between LST and NDVI. Additionally, the study examines the spatial patterns of LST by mapping the directional profiles of LST. Results of the study reveal that over time both the cities have witnessed a dramatic growth in built-up area, systematic reduction in green space and increase in LST. There is 85% increase in builtup area in Surat in the past 2 decades and 31% increase in built-up area in Bharuch during the same period. At the same time, mean surface temperature in Surat has shown an increase of 2.42 °C per decade while in Bharuch the mean surface temperature has increased by 2.13 °C per decade. Moreover, examination of correlation between LST and NDVI showed a negative relation between the two parameters. Directional profiles showed a continued increase in temperature from 2008 to 2016 from North to South direction Surat indicating an increased urbanization in that direction. Also, new peaks were observed in the profile of Surat for 2008 and 2016 in the north-south direction indicating urban expansion particularly in the southern part of the city. Moreover, substantial growth has taken place in the central part of the city and along the banks of the rivers Tapi and Narmada. This study will be helpful in investigations that address the challenges of urbanization in Surat and Bharuch by assisting local government officials, land management professionals and planners to determine areas where growth must be curbed to avoid further environmental degradation thereby assisting in systematic urban planning practices."
Land Use Policy,"Information on Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes and the driving forces behind such modifications underpin a proper understanding of the dynamics of LULC changes. This study aimed to analyse the dynamics of LULC change trends and its driving factors in Jimma Geneti District (JGD) for the year 1973-2019. Five satellite images downloaded from USGS were used to analyze and assess the geospatial and temporal changes in LULC. In addition, in-depth household interviews, key informant interview, focus group discussions (FGD) and field observations were used to address the drivers of LULC changes. The result showed a decline in forest land from 8632.5 ha (20.9 %) in 1973-5647.23 ha (13.7 %) in 2019. The study further revealed that the total of forest land cleared between 1973 and 2019 was estimated to be 2985.27 ha (7.22 %). In other words, 34.6 % of the forest cover that existed in 1973 was lost. Similarly, wetlands declined from 9919.5 ha (24.0 %) in 1973-2000.24 ha (4.8 %) in 2019. Similarly, wetlands declined from 9919.5 ha (24.0 %) in 1973-2000.24 ha (4.8 %) in 2019. On the other hand, cultivated land has increased from 18617.0 ha (45.1 %) to 27708.1 ha (67.1 %). Similarly, the increment in settlement areas has elevated from 908.7 ha (2.2 %) to 4436.46 ha (10.7 %) during the same period. Agricultural expansion, cutting trees for various purposes (such as firewood, charcoal and construction material), overgrazing and the expansion of settlements, were identified as the major proximate causes of these changes. Moreover, the major underlying drivers of LULC changes include population growth, changes in policy and institutions, poverty and lack of awareness on the importance of natural resource conservation for sustainable livelihoods. From this study, it can be concluded that JGD has experienced a significant change in LULC over the past 46 years and were affected both positively and negatively. Hence, a wide range of policy packages are required for sustainable land management practices which take in to account synergies and trade-offs between the various land uses in the study area. The national and local governments should enforce sustainable land management approaches through integrating land use planning and management into all development programmes and projects."
"Integrated modeling of hydrological processes and groundwater recharge based on land use land cover, and climate changes: A systematic review","Groundwater is the main available freshwater resource and therefore its use, management and sustainability are closely related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, Land Use Land Cover (LULC) and climate change are among the factors impacting groundwater recharge. The use of land-use and climate data in conjunction with hydrological models are valuable tools for assessing these impacts on river basins. This systematic review aimed at assessing the integrated modeling approach for evaluating hydrological processes and groundwater recharge based on LULC and climate change. The analysis is based on 200 peer-reviewed articles indexed in Scopus, and the Web of Science. Continuous research and the development of context-specific groundwater recharge models are essential to increase the long-term viability of water resources in any basin. The long-term impacts of natural and anthropogenic drivers on river basin interactions require integrating knowledge and modeling capabilities across biophysical responses, environmental problems, policies, economics, social, and data."
"Monitoring land use and land cover change near a nuclear power plant construction site: Akkuyu case, Turkey",". The agricultural areas in the study area were changed into other LULC classes: 9.1% to artificial surfaces, 27.6% to barren lands, and 21.7% to forest. The rise in the area of artificial surfaces was especially noticeable within the 1 km buffer zone: construction activities converted 36.1% of agricultural fields, 54.1% of forests, and 23.2% of barren lands into artificial surfaces. The filling activities on the seashore resulted in a loss of water bodies of up to 26.5%. The study provides an overview of how the LULC classes have evolved on the construction site and in the region. In the end, the study discusses how the current land use preferences in the region contradict the issues and concerns mentioned in the existing body of literature."

"Detection of land use/land cover changes in a watershed: A case study of the Murredu watershed in Telangana state, India","Land-use change refers to a change in how a particular area of land is utilised or managed by humans. Land-cover change refers to a change in some continuous features of the land, such as vegetation type, soil conditions, and so on. For the purpose of identifying change-vulnerable areas and creating sustainable ecosystem services, mapping and quantifying the state of land use/land cover (LULC) changes and change-causing factors are crucial. The present research utilizes a geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) techniques to categorise and identify changes in a Murredu watershed in Telangana state, India, between 1996 and 2019. Five major LULC categories (agricultural land, forest, barren land, built-up area, and waterbodies) from satellite images of 1996 to 2019 were mapped. The maximum likelihood approach was used to supervise the classification process, and high-resolution Google Earth Pro was used to evaluate the accuracy of the classified map. The accuracy of the mapping was evaluated using the error matrix and Kappa statistics. Overall classification accuracy for the classified image of 2019 was found to be 90 % with overall kappa statistics of 85.98%. From these findings, change detection analysis shows that the area used for agricultural land, barren land, forest, built-up areas, and waterbodies has increased by 5.17%, 3.39%, 0.84%, and 0.26%, respectively, between 1996 and 2019. The forest area has decreased by 9.67% at the same time. Therefore, this research anticipates that the findings might provide information to planners, land managers, and decision-makers for the sustainable management and development of the natural resource."
"This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal. Content is final as presented, with the exception of pagination","High spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images can reflect more subtle changes and more specific types of land use and land cover (LULC) due to the abundant spatial geometric information. In this article, a class-prior object-oriented conditional random field (COCRF) framework consisting of a binary change detection (CD) task and a multiclass CD task is proposed to fill the application gap. In the proposed framework, the class-prior knowledge is used to improve the construction of the unary potential in both the binary and multiclass CD tasks, to reduce the influence of spectral variability. The binary CD result provides a constraint to the multiclass CD result. As a result, both parts have effective interaction.
The class posterior probability images of two dates can be obtained automatically with the class-prior knowledge by sample migration. Furthermore, an object constraint described by the class dispersion within the objects is added to improve the smoothness in local objects, while the pairwise potential improves the smoothness of the whole area by using the eight-neighborhood spectral information of the center pixel. By integrating the above approaches, the problems of error accumulation and the manual intervention required in the traditional multiclass CD methods can be relieved. An adaptive parameter estimation strategy is also adopted in the proposed framework, to save the time required for manual parameter setting. The proposed COCRF framework was validated on two HSR remote sensing image data sets, where it achieved a better performance than the other state-of-the-art CD methods."
"An Analysis of Urban Land Use/Land Cover Changes in Blantyre City, Southern Malawi (1994-2018)","Rapid and unplanned urban growth has adverse environmental and social consequences. This is prominent in sub-Saharan Africa where the urbanisation rate is high and characterised by the proliferation of informal settlements. It is, therefore, crucial that urban land use/land cover (LULC) changes be investigated in order to enhance effective planning and sustainable growth. In this paper, the spatial and temporal LULC changes in Blantyre city were studied using the integration of remotely sensed Landsat imageries of 1994, 2007 and 2018, and a geographic information system (GIS). The supervised classification method using the support vector machine algorithm was applied to generate the LULC maps. The study also analysed the transition matrices derived from the classified map to identify prominent processes of changes for planning prioritisation. The results showed that the built-up class, which included urban structures such as residential, industrial, commercial and public installations, increased in the 24-year study period. On the contrary, bare land, which included vacant lands, open spaces with little or no vegetation, hilly clear-cut areas and other fallow land, declined over the study period. This was also the case with the vegetation class (i.e., forests, parks, permanent tree-covered areas and shrubs). The post-classification results revealed that the LULC changes during the second period (2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015)(2016)(2017)(2018) were faster compared to the first period (1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007). Furthermore, the results revealed that the increase in built-up areas systematically targeted the bare land and avoided the vegetated areas, and that the vegetated areas were systematically cleared to bare land during the study period . The findings of this study have revealed the pressure of human activities on the land and natural environment in Blantyre and provided the basis for sustainable urban planning and development in Blantyre city."
Reconstructing Three Decades of Land Use and Land Cover Changes in Brazilian Biomes with Landsat Archive and Earth Engine,"Brazil has a monitoring system to track annual forest conversion in the Amazon and most recently to monitor the Cerrado biome. However, there is still a gap of annual land use and land cover (LULC) information in all Brazilian biomes in the country. Existing countrywide efforts to map land use and land cover lack regularly updates and high spatial resolution time-series data to better understand historical land use and land cover dynamics, and the subsequent impacts in the country biomes. In this study, we described a novel approach and the results achieved by a multi-disciplinary network called MapBiomas to reconstruct annual land use and land cover information between 1985 and 2017 for Brazil, based on random forest applied to Landsat archive using Google Earth Engine. We mapped five major classes: forest, non-forest natural formation, farming, non-vegetated areas, and water. These classes were broken into two sub-classification levels leading to the most comprehensive and detailed mapping for the country at a 30 m pixel resolution. The average overall accuracy of the land use and land cover time-series, based on a stratified random sample of 75,000 pixel locations, was 89% ranging from 73 to 95% in the biomes. The 33 years of LULC change data series revealed that Brazil lost 71 Mha of natural vegetation, mostly to cattle ranching and agriculture activities. Pasture expanded by 46% from 1985 to 2017, and agriculture by 172%, mostly replacing old pasture fields. We also identified that 86 Mha of the converted native vegetation was undergoing some level of regrowth. Several applications of the MapBiomas dataset are underway, suggesting that reconstructing historical land use and land cover change maps is useful for advancing the science and to guide social, economic and environmental policy decision-making processes in Brazil."
Predicting changes in land use/land cover and seasonal land surface temperature using multi-temporal landsat images in the northwest region of Bangladesh,Configurations of LULC and seasonal LST change in the Northwest region of Bangladesh were analyzed. Built-up area expansion contributed to increased summer and winter LST by 0.55 C and 2.54 C per decade from 1999-2019. Temperature increases have resulted in a significant decline in agricultural productivity over the last 30 years. Summer and winter LST simulations indicate that more than 50 % and 13 % will likely be in >35 C by 2039. Prediction of LULC change and seasonal LST variation needs to be considered during urban development plans.
Environmental and Sustainability Indicators,"Changes in land use/land cover (LULC) are a global environmental concern that has a significant impact on sustainable land and water resource management and development as well as hydrological processes. The primary driving forces of LULC changes in developing countries are population pressure, demand for firewood collection and construction material, shortage of cultivated land, land tenure insecurity, and deforestation. Focusing on the Ethiopian Birr river watershed, the study investigates changes in LULC trends, extents, and magnitudes over the last 32 years using geospatial technologies such as Landsat images of 1986, 2001, and 2018. The supervised land use land cover classification technique was applied to classify the LULC classes using the maximum likelihood algorithm technique. Between 1986 and 2018, agricultural land increased significantly from 56.39% to 70.19%, while settlements increased from 0.73%) to 1.42%. On the other hand, bushlands, forest areas, and grasslands LULC classes in the study area decreased from 26.18% to 19.30%, 4.94%-1.92%, and 11.77%-7.16%, respectively. The findings suggest that integrated watershed management and land use planning should be concerned and implemented in the Birr River watershed."
"Analysis of Land Use/land Cover Changes and Prediction of Future Changes With Land Change Modeler: Case of Belek, Turkey","In the areas declared to be a tourism center, a rapid tourism-related development occurs depending on the investments in tourism, which causes a dramatic land use and land cover changes. Determining, monitoring, and modeling of land use and land cover changes are required in order to ensure the conservation-use balance and sustainability within such vulnerable areas that are under the development pressure. This study consists of four steps. In the rst step, the Landsat images dated 1985, 2000, and 2021 were classi ed using the maximum likelihood method and the land use and land cover of Belek Tourism Center located in Turkey were determined. The second step included the identi cation of areal and spatial changes between the land use and land cover classes for the periods between 1985 and 2000, 2000 and 2021, and 1985 and 2021.  In the third step, the land use and land cover changes in Belek Tourism Center for 2040 were modeled using the Land Change Modeler. Last step evaluated the relationship between the modeled spatial development pattern and the current planning decisions. According to the results obtained through a 36-year research, the rates of settlement, forest, and water body areas have increased by 11.91%, 13.67%, and 0.82%, respectively whereas the rates of barren land and agricultural areas have reduced by 22.25% and 4.15%, respectively. The land use map modeled for 2040 predicts the settlement areas to expand by 5.46% and the agricultural areas to shrink by 4.21% by comparison with 2021."
"Investigating land use land cover changes and their effects on land surface temperature and urban heat islands in Sharqiyah Governorate, Egypt","The Urban Heat Island (UHI) issue is a result of the undesirable effects of urban growth on the environment, such as temperature rises and landscape changes that cause environmental dangers. Thus, the purpose of this research is to investigate the effect of Land Use Land Cover (LULC) change on Land Surface Temperature (LST) and then study UHI in Sharqiyah from 2001 to 2022 using remote sensing data. This data was collected from the Landsat satellite and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 11A Thermal sensors. A Mono-Window Algorithm was used on Landsat 8 and 9 data to estimate the LST. To determine the LST and UHI, the thermal band was utilized. LULC maps were created using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification technique. To evaluate various LULC indices in the Sharqiyah and find their correlation with LST, the spectral indices Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Bare Land Index (NDBaI), and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) were obtained from the processing of multispectral Landsat data. To check data sources, air temperature measurements for Sharqiyah were also acquired. The results show that urban expansion has increased in a noticeable trend. The built-up area increased by 18.9% during the research phase, and the region's mean LST increased within 3.98℃. The UHI threshold temperature increased by 4.27℃. This research is critical for Planning Engineers and environmental scientists to realize LULC variations effects on LST and to suggest suitable political steps to regulate urbanization in Sharqiyah Governorate."
Turkish Journal of Agriculture -Food Science and Technology,"This is study is based with the support of RS-GIS technology on the land use of Samsun Center, as well as the coastal districts of Ilkadım,Atakum,Bafra Plain, through the processing and interpretation of satellite images in the summer months of 2000,2010,2020. Spatial and temporal variability properties of LU/LC were determined using MLC algorithm, controlled classification approach. The predictive values of the LU/LC change that will occur in 2030, calculated with the MLP-ANN model based on Machine Learning algorithms and mapped with the QGIS 3.16 program. To determine the accuracy coefficient of the model, 2020 LU/LC simulation performed using the transition potential matrix of 2000 and 2010 LU/LC data. The results of simulation were compared the data of land use land cover with the 2020 to evaluate the accuracy of the simulation model. The model of MLP-ANN provided an accuracy of 72% based on the kappa fit index. According to MLP-ANN model 2030 results were an increase of 73.33 km² in built up areas, an increase of 56.89 km² in bare areas, and a decrease of 129.66 km² in green areas. It provided a reference basis for future Samsun urban to rural coastline LU planning and management and LU structure optimization."
"Global 10 m Land Use Land Cover Datasets: A Comparison of Dynamic World, World Cover and Esri Land Cover","The European Space Agency's Sentinel satellites have laid the foundation for global land use land cover (LULC) mapping with unprecedented detail at 10 m resolution. We present a cross-comparison and accuracy assessment of Google's Dynamic World (DW), ESA's World Cover (WC) and Esri's Land Cover (Esri) products for the first time in order to inform the adoption and application of these maps going forward. For the year 2020, the three global LULC maps show strong spatial correspondence (i.e., near-equal area estimates) for water, built area, trees and crop LULC classes. However, relative to one another, WC is biased towards over-estimating grass cover, Esri towards shrub and scrub cover and DW towards snow and ice. Using global ground truth data with a minimum mapping unit of 250 m 2 , we found that Esri had the highest overall accuracy (75%) compared to DW (72%) and WC (65%). Across all global maps, water was the most accurately mapped class (92%), followed by built area (83%), tree cover (81%) and crops (78%), particularly in biomes characterized by temperate and boreal forests. The classes with the lowest accuracies, particularly in the tundra biome, included shrub and scrub (47%), grass (34%), bare ground (57%) and flooded vegetation (53%). When using European ground truth data from LUCAS (Land Use/Cover Area Frame Survey) with a minimum mapping unit of <100 m 2 , we found that WC had the highest accuracy (71%) compared to DW (66%) and Esri (63%), highlighting the ability of WC to resolve landscape elements with more detail compared to DW and Esri. Although not analyzed in our study, we discuss the relative advantages of DW due to its frequent and near real-time data delivery of both categorical predictions and class probability scores. We recommend that the use of global LULC products should involve critical evaluation of their suitability with respect to the application purpose, such as aggregate changes in ecosystem accounting versus site-specific change detection in monitoring, considering trade-offs between thematic resolution, global versus. local accuracy, class-specific biases and whether change analysis is necessary. We also emphasize the importance of not estimating areas from pixel-counting alone but adopting best practices in design-based inference and area estimation that quantify uncertainty for a given study area."
Land use land cover change and the resilience of social-ecological systems in a sub-region in South west Cameroon,"LULCC and magnitude of impact of the drivers and predictors of LULCC in the sub-region by engag-| ing 25 stakeholders in a focus group survey. Other cultivated areas of cropland, built-up, oil palm, and banana plantation covers increased by 21,360 ha (10.5%), 3152 ha (1.6%), 5721 ha (2.8%), and 1823 ha (0.9%), while dense forest, rubber and tea plantation covers decreased by -44,945 ha (-22.1%), -15,557 ha (-7.7%), and -110 ha (-0.1%), respectively, from 1986 to 2018. Most of the deforestation and LULCC was caused by expansion of other cultivated areas of cropland by smallholders, contrary to the widely publicised narrative of agro-industrial and built-up areas expansion. The spatial pattern of LULCC showed that expansion of other cultivated areas of cropland and agro-industrial plantations were highest in the north and east zones, respectively, while expansion of builtup areas and decrease in agro-industrial plantation covers were highest in the central, south and western coastal zones of Fako division. The variations in the spatial patterns of LULCC between the sub-divisions are attributed to differences in rates of population growth and urbanisation, topography, size of farming population, proportion of cultivable land, socioeconomic opportunities, and strength and resilience of Abstract The old paradigm of horizontal expansion of agricultural land and built-up areas over highland and lowland ecosystems remains highly prevalent in Cameroon, causing significant changes in LULC and undermining the resilience and sustainability of social-ecological systems. We analysed satellite imagery of 1986 and 2018 to examine the extent and spatial patterns of LULCC in Fako sub-region of Cameroon. In addition, we explored the likelihood of Highlights • Most of the deforestation and LULCC was caused by expansion of other cultivated areas of cropland by smallholders, contrary to the widely publicised narrative of agro-industrial plantation and built-up area expansion from 1986 to 2018. • Dense forest and rubber plantation covers decreased, while oil palm and banana plantation covers increased, owing to local economics and increase in local and international palm oil demand. • Spatial patterns of change in LULC classes were highly variable within the sub-region, but common temporal trends in LULCC were observed on the most part. • Differences in biophysical and socio-economic factors explained the variability in the spatial patterns of LULCC among sub-divisions. • Changes in LULC decreased with elevation, but increased with nearness to the sea and national road networks."
Development of a map for land use and land cover classification of the Northern Border Region using remote sensing and GIS,"The land use and land cover study (LULC) play an essential role in regional socio-economic development and natural resource management to develop sustainable development in vegetation changes, water quantity and quality, land resources, and coastal management. This study uses remote sensing data to investigate LULC in the Northern Border Region (NBR) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The purpose of this study is to obtain a better understanding of the patterns and drivers of changes in LULC in the NBR over the past three decades. Remote sensing data from Landsat imagery between 1990 and 2022 were used to classify LULC types, and a time series analysis was performed using Landsat imagery to detect changes over time. The classification finds four main classes: bare land, built-up area, rocks, and vegetation. The results indicate a significant increase in urban development. The outcomes revealed that most urbanization occurred in the outskirts of the cities, where previously there were bare soil lands. The main drivers of urbanization were population growth and economic development. These findings have important implications for city planning, the management of green spaces, and the sustainable development of cities. Maximum Likelihood classifier was used to perform the classification. The accuracy assessment demonstrated satisfactory results, with an overall accuracy of 92.6%. The study paves the way for further monitoring LULC changes in the NBR geographic location. The technique used was adequate to address the objectives of this study."
"Land Use/Land Cover Change Impact on Hydrological Process in the Upper Baro Basin, Ethiopia","Understanding the hydrological process associated with Land Use/Land Cover (LU/LC) change is vital for decision-makers in improving human wellbeing. LU/LC change significantly affects the hydrology of the landscape, caused by anthropogenic activities. e scope of this study is to investigate the impact of LU/LC change on the hydrological process of Upper Baro Basin for the years 1987, 2002, and 2017. e Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)  model was used for the simulation of the streamflow. e required data for the SWAT model are soils obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization; Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and LU/LC were obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). e meteorological data such as Rainfall, Temperature, Sunshine, Humidity, and Wind Speeds were obtained from the Ethiopian National Meteorological Agency. Data on discharge were obtained from Ministry of Water, Irrigation and Electricity. Ecosystems are deemed vital. Landsat images were used to classify the LU/LC pattern using ERDAS Imagine 2014 software and the LU/LC were classified using the Maximum Likelihood Algorithm of Supervised Classification. e Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2) global sensitivity method within SWAT Calibration and Uncertainty Procedures (SWAT-CUP) was used to identify the most sensitive streamflow parameters. e calibration was carried out using observed streamflow data from 01 January 1990 to 31 December 2002 and a validation period from 01 January 2003 to 31 December 2009. LU/LC analysis shows that there was a drastic decrease of grassland by 15.64% and shrubland by 9.56% while an increase of agricultural land and settlement by 18.01% and 13.01%, respectively, for 30 years. e evaluation of the SWAT model presented that the annual surface runoff increased by 43.53 mm, groundwater flow declined by 27.58 mm, and lateral flow declined by 5.63 mm. e model results showed that the streamflow characteristics changed due to the LU/LC change during the study periods 1987-2017 such as change of flood frequency, increased peak flows, base flow, soil erosion, and annual mean discharge. Curve number, an available water capacity of the soil layer, and soil evaporation composition factor were the most sensitive parameters identified for the streamflow. Both the calibration and validation results disclosed a good agreement between measured and simulated streamflow. e performance of the model statistical test shows the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) and Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) efficiency values 0.87 and 0.81 for calibration periods of 1990-2002 and 0.84 and 0.76 for the validation period of 2003 to 2009, respectively. Overall, LU/LC significantly affected the hydrological condition of the watershed. erefore, different conservation strategies to maintain the stability and resilience of the ecosystem are vital."
Remote Sensing of Environment,"Spatiotemporal fusion is a feasible solution to resolve the tradeoff between the temporal and spatial resolutions of remote sensing images. However, the development of spatiotemporal fusion algorithms has not yet reached maturity, and existing methods still face many challenges, e.g., accurately retrieving land cover changes and improving the robustness of fusion algorithms. The Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) method proposed by Zhu et al. in 2016 solved the abovementioned problems to some extent. However, FSDAF has two shortcomings that can be further improved: (1) FSDAF is prone to losing spatial details and predicting a ""blurrier"" image due to the input of coarse pixels containing type change information and a large amount of boundary information for unmixing calculation, and (2) FSDAF does not optimize the areas of land cover change. In this paper, an improved FSDAF method incorporating change detection technology and an optimized model for changed-type areas (FSDAF 2.0) was proposed to improve the aforementioned problems. Based on the existing FSDAF algorithm, FSDAF 2.0 excludes changed pixels and boundary pixels for unmixing calculation, and establishes a model to optimize the changed pixels. Its performance was compared with that of the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), the original FSDAF, and the enhanced FSDAF that incorporates sub-pixel class fraction change information (SFSDAF). Two sites consisting of landscapes with heterogeneous and large-scale abrupt land cover changes were employed for testing. The results of the experiments demonstrate that FSDAF 2.0 effectively improves the shortcomings of FSDAF, blends synthetic fine-resolution images with higher accuracy than that of the other three methods at two different sites, and strengthens the robustness of the fusion algorithm. More importantly, FSDAF 2.0 has a powerful ability to retrieve land cover changes and provides a feasible way to improve the performance of retrieving land cover changes. Consequently, FSDAF 2.0 has great potential for monitoring complex dynamic changes in the Earth's surface."
