ABSTRACT:
Accurate land use land cover (LULC) classification is vital for the sustainable management of natural resources and to learn how the landscape is changing due to climate. For accurate and efficient LULC classification, high-quality datasets and robust classification methods are required. With the increasing availability of satellite data, geospatial analysis tools, and classification methods, it is essential to systematically assess the performance of different combinations of satellite data and classification methods to help select the best approach for LULC classification. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the LULC classification performance of two commonly used platforms (i.e., ArcGIS Pro and Google Earth Engine) with different satellite datasets (i.e., Landsat, Sentinel, and Planet) through a case study for the city of Charlottetown in Canada. Specifically, three classifiers in ArcGIS Pro, including support vector machine (SVM), maximum likelihood (ML), and random forest/random tree (RF/RT), are utilized to develop LULC maps over the period of 2017-2021. Whereas four classifiers in Google Earth Engine, including SVM, RF/RT, minimum distance (MD), and classification and regression tree (CART), are used to develop LULC maps for the same period. To identify the most efficient and accurate classifier, the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient for each classifier is calculated throughout the study period for all combinations of satellite data, classification platforms, and methods. Change detection is then conducted using the best classifier to quantify the LULC changes over the study period. Results show that the SVM classifier in both ArcGIS Pro and Google Earth Engine presents the best performance compared to other classifiers. In particular, the SVM in ArcGIS Pro shows an overall accuracy of 89% with Landsat, 91% with Sentinel, and 94% with Planet. Similarly, in Google Earth Engine, the SVM shows an accuracy of 87% with Landsat 8 and 92% with Sentinel 2. Furthermore, change detection results show that 13.80% and 14.10% of forest areas have been turned into bare land and urban class, respectively, and 3.90% of the land has been converted into the urban area from 2017 to 2021, suggesting the intensive urbanization. The results of this study will provide the scientific basis for selecting the remote sensing classifier and satellite imagery to develop accurate LULC maps.

## Introduction ##
Accurate information on land use land cover (LULC) can facilitate various research activities related to floods, droughts, migration, and climate change at several scales. The constant and precise investigation of LULC is a vital aspect of any region's sustainability and development. LULC changes (i.e., deforestation and urbanization, etc.) are one the prominent drivers of climate change around the globe 
The severity of extreme events is mainly modulated by the LULC changes. The extreme events of heat waves in 2003 and 2010 in Western Europe and Russia inspired researchers to investigate extreme events by looking at the LULC of the area 
Analysis of different LULC categories, using machine learning approaches, can be performed in a geographic information system platform (i.e., ArcGIS Pro) or Google Earth Engine using remote sensing datasets. The geographic information system can be used for a better understanding of spatial and temporal analysis related to LULC classification 
Recently, state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms (i.e., random forest/random tree (RF/RT), classification and regression tree (CART), support vector machine (SVM), maximum likelihood (ML), and minimum distance (MD)) have captured the researchers' attention 

## Data and Methods ##


## Study Area ##
This study focuses on Charlottetown, the capital of Prince Edward Island (PEI), commonly known as the Island, a province of Canada located in the Maritimes (Figure 

## Satellite Data ##
This project will employ three types of datasets to perform LULC categorization. These datasets include low (Landsat 8), median (Sentinel 2), and high (Planet) resolution satellite images. In this research, all visible and infrared bands (the thermal infrared band was excluded) were used for the LULC analysis 

## Methodological Framework for LULC Classification ##
Currently, geospatial Big Data are garnering an abundance of attention and are emphasized globally. ArcGIS Pro and Google Earth Engine are the most popular platforms for large data processing and LULC classification. Several approaches have been established and employed to measure changes in different LULC changes. However, there is currently no research that uses both platforms and includes different input datasets to examine the accurate LULC changes through time in Charlottetown, PEI. In this study, a framework was developed to compare and analyze the performance and viability of different classification methods in ArcGIS Pro and Google Earth Engine, using different datasets. Table 

## Classification Methods ##
To perform a pixel-based supervised classification, a set of training samples specific to each year was obtained. Every training sample pixel was assigned to a LULC class on the basis of supplementary data, such as Google Street View and orthophoto images from each year of the study 

## • ##
Classification and regression tree (CART) is a decision classification tree that facilitates straightforward decision-making and regression analyses 

## • ##
Random forest/random tree (RF/RT) RF/RT constructs an ensemble classifier and is one of the commonly used classifiers 

## • ##
Support vector machine (SVM). One of the supervised learning techniques is SVM which is used to resolve different problems related to regression and classifications.
In the training phase, SVM classifiers generate an ideal hyperplane that splits several classes with the less misclassified pixels from input datasets. The kernel functions, cost parameters, and gamma 

## • ##
Minimum distance classifier (MD). The MD classifier classifies imagery datasets into classes that reduce the distance between the class in multi-feature space and image data. This distance between the image data is expressed as a similarity index, such that the minimal distance and highest similarity are equivalent. The main idea behind this process is to calculate the spectral distance between the measurement vector for the candidate pixel and the mean vector for each signature 
• Maximum likelihood classifier (ML). Maximum likelihood classifier is a supervised classification method that describes every band by a normal distribution. This supervised classification method is based on the Byes theorem 

## Data Processing ##
In Google Earth Engine, LULC classification maps were generated using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 imagery. We use SVM, RF, MD, and CART classifiers in Google Earth Engine. Contaminated pixels caused by cloud cover were eliminated from all images using the cloud mask method provided on the Google Earth Engine 
Using SVM, RT, and ML classifiers, LULC maps were created in ArcGIS Pro. As the major input for classification, images with the least or zero cloud cover were employed. Atmospherically and geometrically corrected images from the three sources (Landsat 8, Sentinel 2, and Planet) with zero cloud cover were utilized as the primary input. The source of data was USGS and Planet Scope sites. Images from the Planet Scope site were mosaiced to cover the whole study area in ArcGIS Pro. Then, all images from all three data sources were clipped to the city of Charlottetown boundary using ArcGIS Pro for LULC classification. Image treatment is entirely independent in ArcGIS Pro than in Google Earth Engine.
A total of 354 training samples were used for LULC classification, from which 284 were used as training samples, and 145 were used as testing samples. Google Earth Pro was used to visually evaluate high-resolution orthophoto images from 2017 to 2021. Training and validation samples were generated with Google Earth Pro. They were then loaded into ArcGIS Pro and the Google Earth Engine platform as shape files to train classifiers. As a rule 
For the CART classifier: the optimal cross-validation factor was estimated to be ten based on the research of Kohavi 

## Accuracy Assessment ##
Methods, procedures, time, and space affected the classification's precision 
Overall Accuracy = T C.P T S.P × 100
Whereas T C.P is the total number of correctly classified pixels and T S.P is the total number of sample pixels.
Whereas O.A is the overall accuracy and C.A is chance agreement. Equations ( 

## Change Detection ##
Numerous techniques exist to identify the LULC change from different imagery datasets

## Conclusions ##
The climate around the globe has been modified by human activities through the LULC changes. The LULC changes (i.e., deforestation, urbanization, etc.) played an important role in climate change since the pre-industrial era 
Change detection analysis shows deforestation and rapid urbanization as 18.80% of forest area was converted to bare land, and 38.81% of bare land was converted to urban area throughout the study period. In addition, some classes may be categorized using expert knowledge and supplementary data
