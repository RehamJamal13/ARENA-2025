ABSTRACT:
Changes in land use/land cover (LULC) are a global environmental concern that has a significant impact on sustainable land and water resource management and development as well as hydrological processes. The primary driving forces of LULC changes in developing countries are population pressure, demand for firewood collection and construction material, shortage of cultivated land, land tenure insecurity, and deforestation. Focusing on the Ethiopian Birr river watershed, the study investigates changes in LULC trends, extents, and magnitudes over the last 32 years using geospatial technologies such as Landsat images of 1986, 2001, and 2018. The supervised land use land cover classification technique was applied to classify the LULC classes using the maximum likelihood algorithm technique. Between 1986 and 2018, agricultural land increased significantly from 56.39% to 70.19%, while settlements increased from 0.73%) to 1.42%. On the other hand, bushlands, forest areas, and grasslands LULC classes in the study area decreased from 26.18% to 19.30%, 4.94%-1.92%, and 11.77%-7.16%, respectively. The findings suggest that integrated watershed management and land use planning should be concerned and implemented in the Birr River watershed.

## Introduction ##
Changes in land use/land cover (LULC) are the conversion of different land-use classes to the earth's terrestrial surface, which are typically the outcome of complicated interactions between the natural environment and anthropogenic processes 
Agricultural expansion is responsible for almost 90% of global ☆ All authors have approved the manuscript and agree with its submission to the journal. All authors approved the final version of the manuscript and agree to be accountable for all aspects of this work.
deforestation, which has a much greater impact than previously believed 
LULC changes have a variety of negative socio-economic and environmental consequences, including decreased agricultural yield, increased vulnerability to natural hazards (flood, drought, fires), altered ecosystem services, and surface runoff trends 
Deforestation and agricultural land encouragement are the primary causes of land degradation, particularly in Ethiopian highlands and marginal land 
The dynamics of LULC change extent, magnitude, and trends are changing and are strongly linked to natural resource overexploitation; this process is governed by climate, soil characteristics, vegetation density, topography, and natural hazards 

## Materials and methods ##


## Study area ##
The Birr River watershed is situated in the northwestern highlands of Ethiopia. Geographically, the Birr watershed is located between the longitude of 37 • 10ʹ and 38 • 50ʹ E and the latitude of 10 • 30ʹ and 11 • 10ʹ N. The watershed's elevation ranges between 1691 and 4084 m above the mean sea level (Fig. 
There are six major soil types found in the Birr River watershed, which include Haplic Alisols, Eutric Fluvisols, Haplic Luvisols, Eutrc Leptosols, Haplic Nitisols, and Eutric Vertisols (Fig. 

## Data acquisition and processing ##
Satellite imagery from 1986, 2001, and 2018 was used to identify the changing pattern of LULC in the Birr River watershed (Fig. 
Each Landsat image is processed using the earth resource data analysis system (ERDAS) imagine 2015 software. The ERDAS imagine 2015 software is important by increasing the productivity of simplifying for classifications, orthorectification, mosaicking, reprojection, map production, and change detection 

## The LULC classes ##
Because of the prevalent land covers, the spectral responses of features on Landsat images, extensive field observation, and a literature review, the Birr River watershed was divided into five major LULC classes or types that were generated namely; agricultural, bushland, forest, grassland, and settlement (Table 

## Accuracy assessment of LULC classification ##
The accuracy assessment of a classified image is important for analyzing LULC changes and determining the classification process's acceptability. A total of 250 reference data points were used to ensure that all five LULC classes were adequately represented based on their proportional area. The reference ground truth data was chosen in such a way that it appears in both the Landsat images for the respective period of 1986, 20021, and 2018 and the google earth map. Additionally, the validation of land use types with local datasets, and visual inspections were used and adapted to retrieve the reference data. The producer's accuracy (PA), user's accuracy (UA), overall accuracy (OA), and kappa coefficient (K) was used to evaluate the LULC classification accuracy, which is comprised of a 'confusion matrix' or 'error matrix'

A post-classification was performed using each classified Landsat image. Then, each classified LULC map from

The significance of LULC change trend analysis is that determines which land use class or type is transitioning to other land uses

## Results ##


## Analysis of LULC classification ##
In the Birr River watershed, five major LULC types (agricultural land, bushland, forest, grassland, and settlements) were used during the   
Similarly, in 2001 the majority of LULC classes were agriculture and Bushland, which covered an area of 849.90 km 2 (61.99%) and 326.35 km 2 (23.80%), respectively. Forest, grassland, and settlements occupied an area of 24.23 km 2 (1.77%), 154.26 km 2 (11.25%), and 16.25 km 2 (1.19%), respectively, during the same period. Furthermore, 2018 LULC classification types also indicate that agriculture and bushland comprise the greatest share of all other LULC classes, which occupied 962.34 km 2 (70.19%) and 154.26 km 2 (19.30%), respectively, while forest, grassland, and settlements LULC classes occupied an area of 26.39 km 2 (1.92%), 98.22 km 2 (7.16%), and 19.40 km 2 (1.42%), respectively (Table 
Agriculture and bushland covered the largest area in the watershed than the other LULC types in all three years 
The LULC map from 1986, 2001, and 2018 were used to assess the classified accuracy. Based on the accuracy of 1986, 2001, and 2018 LULC maps, the overall accuracies were 90.69, 91.01, and 92.22% respectively, while kappa coefficients were 0.87, 0.88, and 0.89 respectively. Therefore, these results indicate that the classified map and ground truth LULC classes were agreed upon. The classified map also established the minimum accuracy required for the subsequent postclassification operations 

## Extent and rate of LULC change ##
For three time periods, the extent and rates of changes for each LULC were summarized below: 1986, 2001, and 2018 (Tables 
In addition, the extent and rate of change in LULC between 201 and 2018 were presented in (Table 
The extent and rate of LULC change patterns from 1986 to 2018 are also presented in (Table 

## Trend of LULC changes ##
The agricultural land and settlements revealed an increasing trend increasing from 79.86 km 2 to 189.30 km 2 and 6.29 km 2 -9.44 km 2 for    the period 1986 to 2018, respectively. On the other hand, forest, bushland, and grasslands showed a decreasing trend from 1986 to 2018 (Fig. 

## LULC change matrix ##
The LULC change matrix depicts the distribution of main transitions in the five LULC classes used in the study area over the study period (1986-2018) (Table 

## Discussion ##
This study showed five major LULC classes (i.e., agricultural land, bushland, forest land, grassland, and settlements) in the Birr River watershed (Fig. 
The findings of the study revealed that LULC has changed over the last 32 years  in the BirrRiver watershed. Agricultural and settlements have grown significant expansion in the study watershed, increasing by 24.49% and 54.78%, respectively during this period . In contrast, for this period, bushland, forest, and grassland have decreased by 26.27%, 61.01%, and 39.14%, respectively (Table 
Changes in LULC and their dynamics are directly related to biodiversity and land productivity and have huge environmental and societal effects 
Thus, from the grassroots to government levels, sustainable integrated watershed planning, management, and development should be applied and implemented, with close supervision of area afforestation, reforestation, and conservation of the existing watersheds forest, bushland, and grasslands. Furthermore, soil and water conservation on the degraded land, controlling the further expansion of cultivated land, and fuelwood and charcoal production demands.

## Conclusion ##
This study investigated how LULC changed and its dynamics in the Birr River watershed in the last 3 decades (1986-2018) using geospatial technologies. The changing pattern of LULC was used to identify using satellite imagery
