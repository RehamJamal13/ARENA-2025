"Land use and land cover change detection and prediction in Bhutan's high altitude city of Thimphu, using cellular automata and Markov chain",Sonam Wang; Lamchin Munkhnasan; Woo-Kyun Lee,"Rapid urbanization is changing landscapes often resulting in the degradation of ecosystem services and quality of urban life. Remote sensing and GIS tools can provide valuable information to deepen our understanding of the dynamics of these changes to better plan and build sustainable cities for the future. Using remote sensing data, socio-economic data, and field observations, we simulated spatiotemporal dynamics of land use and land cover changes in the city of Thimphu. Simulation results reveal that the landscape of Thimphu city has changed considerably during the study period and the change trend is predicted to continue into 2050. The study observed a significant increase (12.77%) in built-up area from 2002 (52.88%) to 2018 (65.5%), followed by a slight increase in the cover of bare ground. On the contrary, forest cover declined drastically (15.25%) followed by agriculture (1.01%). Rapid population growth triggered by rural urban migration coupled with hasty socio-economic development post democracy are the main drivers of these changes. These changes have fragmentated forest cover, increased soil/gully erosion, surface runoff, and storm induced floods of storm and sanitation drains, thereby impinging on the overall quality of life in the city. Under the business as usual scenario, prediction analysis for the year 2050 show that built up area will consume almost all of the city area (73.21%) with forest significantly reduced to patches making up only about 16% of the city. These findings beg for an urgent need to implement effective planning specially to protect the existing forest and water resources from further degradation.","Introduction: Global cities, which are the engines of economic development 
These studies have generated highly credible information on the state of land use changes and their drivers, which can inform better decision making for sustainable planning of cities 
The Kingdom of Bhutan is located in the rugged landscape of the eastern Himalayas between 88 Àö54' and 92 Àö10 
The impact of LULC changes are more serious in the cities than other areas mainly due to pressures from population, developmental programs, and rate of urbanization  | Methodology:  | Study area: Thimphu city, the capital of Bhutan is the crucible of socio-economic, political, and environmental development in the country. Administratively, the city is composed of central core, southern extension, and northern extension. Geographically, the city is located at 27 Àö29'N latitude and 89 Àö36'E longitude between an elevation of about 2347-2438 m amsl 
With over 15.75% (114,551) of Bhutan's entire population (727,145) living in Thimphu, it is the most populated of all the cities of Bhutan  | Land policy and regime changes: Historically, Thimphu city started in 1961 with some 25 shops or so which currently falls within the central core of the city. Prior to this, the area was occupied by terraced agricultural fields and some 13 villages. Planned development for Thimphu started in 1985 with the establishment of National Urban Development Commission. Since then, two major policy interventions have expediated the growth of the city thereby changing its LULC: Source: (Source: http://glovis.usgs.gov ) (i) Approval of city extension : Government approval of the comprehensive structural plan for Thimphu city in 2002, approved the expansion of the core area towards the south and north  | Data acquisitions and preparation: Methodological framework of the simulation has been illustrated in Fig. 
These data sets were imported into TerrSet satellite image processing software to create a false color composite. Other geospatial data collected from Thimphu city office include, digital elevation model (DEM 30 m resolution), administrative boundaries, and infrastructure data such as road networks, drainage networks, water bodies, buildings, and other important establishments in the city. Additionally, field consultations with select communities, experts, and planners from the city office The years 2002 and 2018 were selected to correspond to major sociopolitical and policy changes in Bhutan that has significant bearings on LULC in the city. Expansion of Thimphu city in 2002 added local areas of Lanjophaka, Heo-Samteling, Jungshi-Pamtsho, Taba and Dechencholing in the north and Changjiji, Lungtenphu, Simtokha, and Babesa in the south ( Fig.  | Pre-processing and classification: Pre-processing is an important step to establish direct affiliation between the acquired data and biophysical phenomenon. Remotely sensed data are susceptible to radiance, geometric, and atmospheric distortions due to acquisition systems and platform movements. One major function of pre-processing is to remove such distortions especially when optical sensor data is used. Atmospheric correction involves removal of haze primarily originating from water vapor, fog, dust, smoke, or other particles in the atmosphere 
Visual interpretation was also used to resolve any issues related to mixed pixels and enhance classification accuracy.
The outputs were then subjected to supervised classification using the Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC). MLC classifier was used as it is a robust and popular algorithm increasingly used for classification of LULC  | Assessment of classification accuracy: Assessment of classification accuracy is a prerequisite for classification data to credibly detect changes 
Where, i is the class number, n is the total number of classified pixels that are being compared to actual data, n ii is the number of pixels belonging to the actual data class i , that were classified with a class i, C i is the total number of classified pixels belonging to class i and G i is the total number of actual data pixels belonging to class i .
In order to deepen the understanding of major land uses and drivers of their changes and socio-environmental implications, the principal investigator carried out field visits in 2019. During the field visits, field observations and consultations were held with the stakeholders including communities, experts and local officials to collect biophysical and climatic data. Discussions were also held to acquire information about urban expansion, evolution of land use, possible reasons for the observed changes and resident perception on socio-environmental resilience. In addition, records of major incidents such as disasters (fire, floods), plantation efforts, policy changes, etc. were also noted. These information and firsthand experience from the field were used to further validate the classified images. | Land use and land cover change analysis: CA-Markov is a robust model that has outperformed other methods for simulating and predicting LULC types  | Markov chain analysis: The Markov model simulated changes in LULC from one time to another in order to predict future change. Markov chain analysis built in module at TerrSet was used to generate transition probability matrix (where the probabilities of transition represent the probability that a pixel of a given class will move to some other cell class in the next time period) and transition area matrix (which represents the total area (in cells) expected to change from one LULC class to another over the prescribed number of time units). The transition probability matrix is expressed in a text file that records the likelihood of moving each land use and land cover category to some other category, while the transition area matrix, also represented in a text file records the number of pixels required to transition from one land use and land cover class to another over the specified number of time unit ( Fig. 
The Markovian chain analysis is represented as, S(t,t + 1) = Pij √ó S(t) , where, S(t) is the system status at time of t, S(t + 1) is the system status at time t + 1; Pij is the transition probability matrix in a state, which is calculated using the following formula 
where, ùúå is the Markov probability matrix, and ùúå ùëñùëó stands for the probability of converting from current state i to another state j in next time period. Low transition will have a probability near (0) and high transition probability near (1). The 2002 LULC image of the Thimphu city was used as the base ( t 1 ) image while 2018 LULC map as the later ( t 2 ) image in this model to obtain the transition matrix between 2002 and 2018. In this study, ArcGIS cross-tabulation functionality was used to generate transitional area matrices by multiplying each column in the transition probability matrix by the number of pixels of corresponding class in the later image. | Transitional suitability maps: Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) was used to build transition suitability maps which show the probability of a pixel to change to another class or remain unchanged. MCE integrates various driving factors to derive a single index of evaluation  | The CA-Markov model: The transition probability matrix and transition area matrix from 2002 to 2018 calculated in Markov chain analysis. The area of each land class to be converted to another LULC classes was estimated based on the transition probabilities. These areas were divided by the total number of iterations (16 years) for the cellular automation to generate the areas to be converted per iteration. We applied a contiguity filter of 5 √ó 5 pixels to define the effect of neighboring cells on the central cell. The future assignment to a specific LULC class for each pixel was based on how much the pixel is suitable for that LULC class and how close the pixel is to other pixels of the same class. The new policy and political developments after 2001 and 2008 were assumed as in simulating future scenarios. The period, 2002-2018 represents a rapid expansion of the city accompanied by expediated socio-economic development that led to significant changes in the city's landscape. Assuming that these probabilities  | Results and discussion:  | Classification accuracy: Model validation is an important precondition for studies that attempt to predict LULC changes  | Analysis of land use and land cover types: LULC analysis allows us to understand biophysical changes such as: loss of productive ecosystems/biodiversity, deterioration of environmental quality, loss of forest and agricultural lands what are important information for planning sustainable cities 
Our study applied latest remote sensing and GIS techniques to quantify LULC in Thimphu city. Using the outputs from remote sensing imagery, field surveys, and topped expert knowledge of the study area, five LULC types were classified; water body, bare ground, built-up area, forest, and agriculture ( Fig. 
These expediated changes can be attributed to: i) governments approval for expansion of the city in 2002, followed by the hastened construction of city infrastructure post Bhutan's transition to democracy in 2008. The resultant improvement in basic facilities combined with creation of additional jobs further attracted more immigration from rural areas and lesser developed cities, causing a boom in real estate and informal settlements and triggering significant changes in land uses.
Studies by  | LULC transition between years: To deepen our understanding of the evolving nature of the LULC types in the city, we created confusion matrices for changes in 2002 and 2018 ( Table 
The potential for these trends to continue remain high with transition probabilities of 0.83 for bare ground and 0.58 for forest to transition to built-up area. Although small, agriculture land shows a significant probability to transition to built-up area which has been the trend in many cities 
The findings indicate that rapid development of urban built will lead to sharp declines in forest and agriculture and increase in urban population. These developments could jeopardize ecosystem health, human well-being, and food security  | Prediction of land use land cover change: Results of LULC prediction using CA-Markov analysis are shown in Table  | Conclusion: This study represents a first ever attempt to simulate the process of land use dynamics and the effects of physical, demographic, and socioeconomic driving forces on LULC in Bhutan's capital city of Thimphu using remote sensing and GIS technology. Results clearly confirm significant changes in LULC from the start of expansion to current area in 2002 to 2018. Significant increase in built-up areas were associated with parallel loss of important land cover types such as forest and agriculture. Significant changes in Thimphu's landscapes are correlated with the government's decision to expand the city northwards and southwards. This expansion received a boost after the institution of constitutional democracy in 2008 which brought in expediated development in the city. These two policy events topped with rapid population growth mainly from rural urban migration for better opportunities and development activities expediated the LULC changes in the city. Combined these factors have reduced and fragmented forest cover which will degrade ecosystem services that are vital for maintaining the quality of human wellbeing in the city. Reports from the city residents also confirm that the impacts of these changes especially in the face of climate change are disproportionately felt by the most vulnerable groups such as low income, women, and children. The results of prediction for 2050 also did not bear well for Thimphu city, with forest cover diminishing to a mere 4.28km 2 (16.32%) which are also highly fragmented. Loss of forest cover will degrade important ecological services and increase vulnerability of the city to landslides, gulley erosion, drying of water sources, worsened air pollution, and loss of important biodiversity. More studies are recommended to especially monitor the impact of these changes and identify adaptive and mitigative interventions for a more sustainable city.
Study also show that remote sensing and GIS are effective tools for simulating urban changes, which are useful for guiding urban planning and management. The findings of this study are useful to policy makers, urban planners, and citizens to adopt better environmental management practices including adaptation and mitigation strategies for the city and its surrounding areas. The study recommend an ecosystem based adaptation policies and other legal frameworks should be developed and practically implemented to protect the current forest cover as well as rehabilitate and improve the existing green spaces in and around the urban centers. Such efforts must focus on planting fruit trees in urban spaces such as parking lots, between buildings, back yards, and along roads. These will significantly, increase water retention, protect soil from ero-sion, host biodiversity, as well as regulate temperature and pollution. Current capacities of storm drains and water reservoirs must also be enhanced. Informal settlements must either be formalized by providing all basic facilities or moved to formal settlements. We also caution the city to restrain from land filling flood plains and use the claimed land for building infrastructure as these areas are not only prone to flooding especially global lake outburst floods but also important for biodiversity. We encourage the city planners and experts to use the findings and recommendations from our study to avert irreversible changes to its LULC.
The accuracy of the classification results was not perfect due to the hilly nature of the study area, where ground changes in altitude can impact the image pixel value. However, it is significant and as such study findings and recommendations can be applied to other cities in Bhutan and other mountainous countries which share similar ecological and socioeconomic characteristics. | Declaration of Competing Interests: Authors have no competing interests.","Urban and Peri-urban agriculture in developing countries studied using remote sensing and in situ methods (, 2010) || Predicting land cover using GIS, Bayesian and evolutionary algorithm methods (, , 2009) || Application of geo-information techniques in land use and land cover change analysis in a peri-urban district of Ghana (, , , , 2015) || Analysis and modelling of urban land cover change in Setubal and sesimbra (, , 2010) || Biodiversity hotspot of Bhutan and its sustainability (, , 2016) || Can engaging local people' interest reduce forest degradation in Central Vietnam?

Environmental & Socio-economic Studies,Tran Nguyen; Tuan,"Land-use change is a human process aimed at transforming the natural landscape and emphasizing the role and function of land for socio-economic activities. However, we do not know how the land transition in Vietnam has been proceeding recently. Thus, this article aims to examine the current urbanization process of land conversion in Vietnam. To explore the current situation and recent change of land use, the author analyzed standardized databases and maps from reports of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of Vietnam (MoNRE), the General Statistics Office of Vietnam (GSO), and the land cover map of Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). Research results show that the land transition in Vietnam has been similar to the world trend. The highest land conversion rate occurs in the North Central and Central Coast regions, but conversion of agricultural land for urbanization is mainly in the Red River Delta and Southeast. The study also noted some negative socio-economic impacts of land conversion on the lives of suburban residents.","Introduction: According to the literature, land use is a landbased feature of what can be built and what the land can be used for. It identifies what types of communities, environments, or settlements can be used for a particular kind of ground (ABARES, 2020). Land use is also a manifestation of various human activities to exploit the landscape. Therefore, landuse change is seen as a human activity to change the natural landscape and emphasize the role and function of land for socio-economic activities 
Urbanization is a socio-economic process manifested by a rapid increase in the number and size of urban population characteristics. It is also defined as urban expansion, as the process of concentrating the population into cities, or as the rapid formation of urban population points based on production and life development 
Scientists also examine and observe urbanization from many different angles  | Land use change in the World: a literature review: Land area of the world is estimated at 13 billion hectares, of which agricultural land accounts for 37.6%, equivalent to 4.9 billion hectares 
Built-up land occupied a relatively small area of about 1-3% in 2005, but it is expected to increase to about 260 to 420 million hectares (about 4-5%) by 2050 (ELECTRIS ET AL., 2009). As for urban land, this area could expand from 40 to 143 million hectares in about 45 years, from 2007 to 2050 (SETO ET AL., 2010). The annual increase in built-up land in developing countries is about 3.6%, while 2.9% is the average increase in industrial countries. The Pacific and Southeast Asia regions have witnessed considerable land conversion rates from 1990 to 2000, at 7.2% and 6.4%, respectively (ANGEL 
Along with labour and capital, the land is a crucial factor for production in classical economics, and land use is considered the agricultural economy's backbone 
Although land-use conversion is essential to promote social progress and economic development, it also has many undesirable effects. These impacts are divided into three main categories: displacement and loss of housing, loss of livelihoods, and environmental pollution thus degradation with  | Methodology:  | Research area: Vietnam is the centre of Southeast Asia and is located on the eastern edge of the Indo-Chinese peninsula. Vietnam's land border is 4,639 km long, bordering the South China Sea (in Vietnam known as the East Sea) and the Gulf of Thailand. In the north, Vietnam borders China; and in the west Laos and Cambodia. The length of the country from north to south is 1,650 km, while the narrowest position, east to west, is nearly 50 km. It is a tropical country, with most of the area being hilly (accounting for half of the territory), and where the terrain is mainly low mountains. With a coastline of 3,260 km, Vietnam is among those countries with a high coastline index compared with its territorial area. Accordingly, on average, there is 1 km of coastline for every 10 km 2 of land, six times higher than the world average. With an area stretching from north to south, Vietnam's zoning also goes through different historical periods.   | Data source: As this study's primary purpose was to evaluate land-use change, the author had to combine many different methods and data sources for comparison. First, raw land cover data were collected from the JAXA. These maps were computed in 2007 for all three regions, 2015 for the North (including Red River Delta and Northen Midland and Mountains), and 2017 for the Central and South regions (the remaining regions). While the North's area of spatial resolution is 15 m, this figure is 10 m for the other two regions. Overall accuracy is above 90% (kappa factor 0.9). This map data has a higher spatial accuracy and resolution than other overlay maps in Vietnam, ensuring user reliability (DUONG  | Results -land use change in Vietnam: Due to Vietnam's complicated location and topography, its land resources are very diverse and differentiated from plains to high mountains, from north to south, and from east to west. Land in this country can be classified into 13 main land groups and 31 categories. Almost all of the population lives in rural areas and works in the agricultural sector, so one-third of the land is used for agriculture (FAO 2019). According to land use purposes, the land is divided into three main land groups: non-agricultural, agricultural, and unused land. Agricultural land is divided into ground for production agriculture, forestry land, aquaculture land, salt-making, and other agriculture. Land for production agriculture includes annual cropland (paddy land and other short-term cropland) and perennial cropland. The forest land is divided into protection, production, and special-use forest land. Fig. 
Land conversion has different effects the types of land use. Paddy land in Vietnam is concentrated in two main areas, the Mekong Delta and Red River Delta Delta (Fig. 
There is a mismatch when comparing data published by the GSO with calculations based on land cover maps. While non-agricultural land is reported to have increased, the area of this GIS layer showed a 21.5% decrease when verified by the land cover map. Published figures are those used in the planning scheme for projects. However, slow progress, inefficiency, misuse, and waste still occur in many projects. In 2019, the progress of 1,878 projects were delayed. Land acquisition and land clearance were the main reasons for this delay (1,267 projects). 73,992.96 ha of land was found to be violated and delayed in project construction. In particular, construction in industrial zones is rampant, but the occupancy rate remains low, leading to a decrease in land-use efficiency. By 2019, Vietnam had established 373 industrial zones with a total area of 114.4 thousand hectares, accounting for 56.9% of the total planned land area. Of these, 280 Industrial Zones were in operation, and 93 are still in the construction and infrastructure stage. The occupancy rate in industrial zones is low, at about 57.4%. Some localities also have lower occupancy rates than the national average (Data collected from the reports of MoNRE). These figures indicate a waste of land resources.
According to the statistics, the evolution of land use purpose is occurring in all localities (Fig.  | Discussion: This study's main aim was to explore land use pattern changes, emphasizing the conversion of agricultural land to built-up land (urban land) in Vietnam. Moreover, rapid urbanization has been a significant highlight in the development process of Vietnam in recent decades. In 1990, the number of urban areas in Vietnam was about 500 and the urbanization rate was about 17%. By 2019, the number of urban areas in Vietnam had increased to 846 (MONRE, 2019). In 1986, Vietnam's urban population was under 13 million, but by 2019, that number was 37 million (WORLD BANK, 2020a).
Urban economic growth is twice the national average, contributing over half of the gross domestic product ( 
According to the objective rule, urbanization must originate from non-agricultural economic development such as industry, commerce, and services (SATTERTHWAITE ET AL., 2010) to replace the agricultural economy gradually. However, unlike other countries in the region and the world, urbanization in Vietnam is characterized by rural urbanization. That is, it transforms agricultural villages and communities into urban districts and wards. Urban developments and growth in Vietnam are late and slower than in some regional countries 
The trend of changing land use purposes in urban areas is to reduce agricultural land, unused land and increase non-agricultural land. Growth in the non-agricultural land area is mainly due to expanding urban land, land for industrial zones, and construction activities. The size of urban land increased due to the conversion from agricultural land, of which rice land was the primary type. In 2011-2015, following the data from MoNRE, Vietnam converted 89.4 thousand hectares of rice land to urban land. In a broader view for the 2007-2017 period, the converted area is estimated at 125.9 thousand ha (data calculated by the author through the land cover maps). This transition is mainly concentrated in three regions: the Southeast, the Red River Delta, and the Mekong River Delta.
Conversion of agricultural land for investment in urban, industrial, and economic zone projects occurs in major urban areas like Binh 
The current status of such land conversion has a significant impact on people's lives, especially those living in peri-urban areas. This problem occurs in Vietnam and occurs in developing countries with high urbanization rates (KUSILUKA ET AL., 2011; AUTAM & ANDERSEN, 2016; NIKUZE ET AL., 2019). Socially, the lifestyle change from rural to urban residents has changed cultural standards and leads to a transformation in the social lives and behavior of each suburban resident. Urbanization also transforms kinship relationships, village communities have multidimensional social relationships, which are complicated by combining many classes of the population and the transformation of orgaizational models. This is one of the characteristics of urban communities (MINISTRY OF CONSTRUCTION, 2020). Land use change has also created social conflicts and intensified violence due to land contention and because the land is the primary source of livelihood for many peri-urban farming households. Land in the peri-urban area is becoming increasingly scarce, leading to higher land prices in this area, inadvertently creating psychological pressure on people. Consequently, the poor may be pushed further out of town/city or are forced into areas of land of little value or which lack public services.
In economic terms, urbanization creates a change in land use in the peri-urban area. The transfer of a large part of the agricultural land into the construction or industrial zones and urban residential areas has resulted in loss of the livelihoods of many farmers. This problem forces them to switch from agricultural production to non-agricultural activities  | Conclusions: Urban expansion and rural restructuring due to land-use conflicts are increasing worldwide 
The study data also showed that land conversion is mainly concentrated in the North Central and Central Coast areas. The percentage of agricultural and non-agricultural land in these regions' provinces has mostly increased by over 7%, while unused land decreased by over 100%. These regions contain many of Vietnam's cities. However, the conversion of land from agriculture to urban areas is concentrated in two regions: the Southeast and the Red River Delta. Furthermore, the transition trend has also shifted to the East of Vietnam to take advantage of the long coastline. This transformation aims to help the development of coastal tourism and facilitate domestic and international trade.
The study has shown the socio-economic impacts on the lives of peri-urban residents after converting agricultural land. Economically, urbanization and industrialization have left 11 million hectares of land abandoned and in danger of degradation and reduces the quality and productivity of agricultural products, thereby significantly affecting the income of farmers. In addition, the transformation of agricultural land to non-agricultural also forces farmers to switch to non-agricultural activities. It is a challenge for farmers because it requires time and investment in both money and intelligence to adapt to the new conditions. Socially, people's lifestyles also require a transition from rural to urban. The change in land use has also created social conflicts and intensified violence due to land disputes.","Research and Application Project of EORC, JAXA, Hompage of High-Resolution Land Use and Land Cover Map Products (, 2020) || The dynamics of global urban expansion (, , , 2005) || Th√¥ng c√°o b√°o ch√≠ K·∫øt qu·∫£ T·ªïng ƒëi·ªÅu tra D√¢n s·ªë v√† Nh√† ·ªü nƒÉm (, 2020. 2019) || ASEAN Sustainable Urbanisation Strategy (, 2018) || Agricultural Land Conversion Drivers: A Comparison Between Less Developed, Developing and Developed Countries (, , , 2011) || Assessing Global Land Use: Balancing Consumption (, , , , , , , , , , 2014) || Urbanization in Developing Countries: Current Trends, Future Projections, and Key Challenges for Sustainability (, 2006) || JAXA High-Resolution Land Use/Land Cover Map for Central Vietnam in (, , , , 2018. 2007. 2017) || The Century Ahead: Four Global Scenarios (, , , , 2009) || Country gender assessment of agriculture and the rural sector in Vietnam (, 2019) || Rural livelihood diversification and household well-being: Insights from Humla, Nepal (, , 2016) || Tropical forests were the primary sources of new agricultural land in the 1980s and 1990s (, , , , , , , 2010) || Assessing Neighbor and Population Growth Influences on Agricultural Land Conversion (, , 2017) || Determinants of Urbanization (, , 2013) || Global Land Use Area Change Matrix: Input to GEO-4 (, 2006) || The negative impact of land acquisition on indigenous communities' livelihood and environment in Tanzania (, , , , , 2011) || Dynamics of Land-use and land-cover change in tropical regions (, , , 2003) || Urbanization and the Southern United States (, 2012) || Midcourse Manoeuvres: An overview of community strategies and remedies for natural resource conflicts in India, Indonesia & Myanmar (, 2018) || T·ªïng quan v·ªÅ khu v·ª±c ven ƒë√¥ c√°c th√†nh ph·ªë l·ªõn trong qu√° tr√¨nh ƒë√¥ th·ªã ho√° nhanh (Overview of urban peri-urban areas in major cities in the rapid urbanization process) (, 2020) || B√°o c√°o M√¥i tr∆∞·ªùng Qu·ªëc gia nƒÉm 2010: T·ªïng quan m√¥i tr∆∞·ªùng Vi·ªát Nam (, 2010. 2010) || B√°o c√°o hi·ªán tr·∫°ng M√¥i tr∆∞·ªùng Qu·ªëc gia giai ƒëo·∫°n 2011-2015 (National Environment Status Report (, 2015. 2011-2015) || B√°o c√°o hi·ªán tr·∫°ng m√¥i tr∆∞·ªùng qu·ªëc gia nƒÉm 2019: Qu·∫£n l√Ω ch·∫•t th·∫£i r·∫Øn sinh ho·∫°t (National environmental status report 2019: Domestic solid waste management) (, 2020) || Livelihood impacts of displacement and resettlement on informal households -A case study from Kigali (, , , , 2019) || The Impact of Land Conversion on Income and Food Security Status For Farmer Households in 5 Villages in Temon Sub-District (, , , 2017. 2017) || Conversion of land use and household livelihoods in Vietnam: A study in Nghe An (, 2021) || Effect of Land Acquisition and Compensation on the Livelihoods of People in Quang Ninh District (, , , 2019) ||  (, ) || Measuring material flows and resource productivity (, 2008. 2008) || Rural and urban areas: comparing lives using rural/urban classifications (, 2011) || Land Use Change and Coastal Management (, , 2017) || Customary Land Conversion and the Formation of the African City (, , 2020) || Land Use.

Land-use change and biodiversity: Challenges for assembling evidence on the greatest threat to nature,Charles Davison; | Carsten Rahbek; Naia Morueta-Holme; Carsten Rahbek,"Land-use change is considered the greatest threat to nature, having caused worldwide declines in the abundance, diversity, and health of species and ecosystems. Despite increasing research on this global change driver, there are still challenges to forming an effective synthesis. The estimated impact of land-use change on biodiversity can depend on location, research methods, and taxonomic focus, with recent global metaanalyses reaching disparate conclusions. Here, we critically appraise this research body and our ability to reach a reliable consensus. We employ named entity recognition to analyze more than 4000 abstracts, alongside full reading of 100 randomly selected papers. We highlight the broad range of study designs and methodologies used; the most common being local space-for-time comparisons that classify land use in situ. Species metrics including abundance, distribution, and diversity were measured more frequently than complex responses such as demography, vital rates, and behavior. We identified taxonomic biases, with vertebrates well represented while detritivores were largely missing. Omitting this group may hinder our understanding of how land-use change affects ecosystem feedback. Research was heavily biased toward temperate forested biomes in North America and Europe, with warmer regions being acutely underrepresented despite offering potential insights into the future effects of land-use change under novel climates. Various land-use histories were covered, although more research in understudied regions including Africa and the Middle East is required to capture regional differences in the form of current and historical land-use practices. Failure to address these challenges will impede our global understanding of land-use change impacts on biodiversity, limit the reliability of future projections and have repercussions for the conservation of threatened species.
Beyond identifying literature biases, we highlight the research priorities and data gaps that need urgent attention and offer perspectives on how to move forward.","| INTRODUC TI ON: The IPBES 2019 global report ranked land-use change as the greatest driver of declines in nature and biodiversity. Combined with the direct exploitation of nature through hunting, fishing, logging, and harvesting, these threats are thought to account for more than 50% of the human impacts on terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems 
It is estimated that the biodiversity of terrestrial communities has declined on average by more than one-fifth 
Land-use change can have direct impacts on species through the destruction of habitat and modification of the environment 
Land-use change also interacts with other global change drivers. For example, it is known that road building facilitates the spread of invasive species 
Several meta-analyses and syntheses have investigated the global impacts of land-use change on biodiversity. These studies generally report that land-use change substantially reduces local species richness 
Species functional groups also show diverse responses to land-use change 
A frequent observation of these syntheses is that the response of biodiversity depends on numerous factors including biome, taxonomic group, type of disturbance, and the biodiversity metric used (e.g., 
Here, we review the land-use change and biodiversity literature to describe the range of study designs, land-use measurements, and species responses that are often used. We investigate the taxonomic, geographic, climatic, and historical distribution of the research by using named entity recognition applied to a large body of papers. Our aim is to critically evaluate the evidence base that is being used to assess the global impact of land-use change on species and to suggest ways for moving this key research forward. | | ME THODS: We identified relevant studies by searching Scopus for articles that investigated the impacts of land use or land cover change on any aspect of species biology. We limited our search to terrestrial studies published prior to 2020, excluding reviews, meta-analyses, and studies from the distant past (search terms in Figure  | | Extracting taxonomic and location data: We applied automated text mining methods to the abstracts of all papers identified by the Scopus search to determine the taxonomic focus and geographic distribution of research investigating land-use change impacts on species. Our analysis used and built on the methods of 
Where extracted names were not directly matched with entries in the Catalogue of Life, we attempted a series of adjusted matches following 
The process of matching extracted names with Catalogue of Life entries sometimes resulted in an extracted name being resolved to several accepted species, for example when the species was an ambiguous synonym or occasionally misapplied name. In these cases (9.9%), we kept only the directly matched accepted name from the same abstract (8.5%) or all candidate names if there were no direct matches (1.5%). Furthermore, all main analyses were conducted at genus level and above. We calculated the number of papers mentioning different taxonomic groups and used genus-level mentions to assess taxonomic representation. Additionally, species counts were aggregated into taxonomic groups and compared with the number of registered species per group in the Catalogue of Life 2019 (Figure 
We extracted and geolocated all place name mentions (toponyms) from abstracts mentioning a species binomial using the Edinburgh Geoparser  | | Deriving additional data and validating: Based on the geolocated mentions identified in the previous step, we derived several attributes to assess the representativeness of the literature in a global context. Firstly, using a map of global biomes 
The background rate of papers published in the subject areas ""Environmental"" or ""Agricultural and Biological science"" on Scopus searched 16/07/2020 (more than 93% of papers in our search have one of these subject areas). (b) Publications on the impact of land-use change on species are increasing faster than the background rate, that is, as a percentage of (a), and mentions of ""climate"" and ""intensity"" are slowly increasing. (c) The frequency of papers mentioning different aspects of species biology from the search criteria. (d) Full Scopus search terms human land-use model to determine the representation of historical land-use patterns 
We manually assessed our search results and accuracy of automated text methods (full information and results in the Supplementary Material). We manually identified and resolved species in a random 1% of papers, and manually geoparsed 100 random abstracts mentioning a species to assess the accuracy of the automated geoparser and the relevance of papers. | | In-depth review of selected papers: To evaluate the methodological approaches used for studying landuse change impacts on species, we read and annotated a random selection of 100 papers. These were selected from papers that mention the term ""land use"" in their title, as these constituted a particularly relevant subset. These 100 papers were downloaded and processed using Zotero reference manager (Roy Rosenzweig Center for History & New Media, 2020). We extracted detailed information on the studies by manually adding keyword tags to each entry,  | | Common study designs: A range of study designs are used in this field, with papers sometimes combining approaches; however, space-for-time substitutions (controlimpact) are by far the most common, accounting for 61 out of the 100 papers in our detailed analysis (Figure 
Detailed before-after-control-impact (BACI) assessments can capture temporal patterns and compare changes to a dynamic baseline. For example, 
All study approaches entail some trade-offs, either logistical or theoretical, and make key assumptions that can influence conclusions and impede efforts to synthesize results (reviewed in De 
The overall finding of manually read studies was for a negative impact of land-use change on species biology; however, a low sample size for all except control-impact studies precluded us from identifying differences in the distribution of findings across study designs. The impact of land-use change on species depends on context, for example, intensifying the use of an abandoned meadow leads to increased species diversity, but intensification of a heavily grazed meadow causes declines  | | Measuring land-use change: Land-use change is challenging to quantify and often involves sorting complex habitats into coarse anthropocentric cover categories such as forest, agriculture, and urban-a simplification that can overlook ecologically significant within class variation. A protected, floristically diverse grassland, for example, may support more and different species than a newly created grass field used for recreation. From an organism's perspective land-use classifications may be arbitrary, as they respond to myriad changes in difficult to measure environmental conditions such as light availability, resources, microclimate, and competition 
There are many methods used to measure land-use change 
Data on land-use intensity, such as fertilizer application or livestock per hectare, attempt to reconcile observed changes in biodiversity to within land-use variation, and capture more detailed facets of land-use change  | | Measuring biodiversity: The choice of species response metric also influences our interpretation of land-use change impacts, with the perceived effects completely reversing in some scenarios. To illustrate this, consider an agricultural area beside a national park, with both habitats containing equal density of a particular species. Considering occupancy or abundance, one might conclude that agriculture is suitable habitat.
However, if vital demographic rates such as births, deaths, and migration are examined, one may find that the agricultural area constitutes a sink habitat, with an elevated death rate that is concealed by immigration (e.g. 
Of the search terms used to identify the species level effects of land-use change, ""diversity"" was the most common, with terms related to species composition, distribution, and abundance also occurring frequently across the 12,192 papers (Figure 
Information on demographics and vital rates help explain how some species persist or thrive in disturbed environments (e.g., 
Still, investigating these detailed variables is difficult, resource demanding, and subject to unique local variation. Basic presence data is easier to collect and is available globally for many taxa (e.g.,  | | Biases in the literature:  | | Taxonomic biases: For understanding the global effects of land-use change on biodiversity, it is essential to sample a diverse range of species. Broad taxonomic coverage helps us capture complex indirect impacts and trophic feedback

Species mentioned belonged to 2721 different genera, with most genera (60%) being mentioned only once (mean = 2.90, SD = 6.63, Figure 
Plants were mentioned in 45% of all papers with a species in their abstract. Several genera of large trees including Pinus, Quercus, and Eucalyptus dominated (Figure 
Vertebrates were mentioned in 43% of papers, almost equaling plants, and were, therefore, overrepresented considering species richness of the group (Figure 
A few mosquito genera were the focus of many arthropod studies, likely due to their role as vectors of human disease and the relationship between land-use change and their prevalence 
Taxonomic biases are a caveat to the conclusions of many landuse change meta-analyses. Some syntheses resort to investigating a handful of well-studied groups, trading generality for data availability (e.g.,  | | Geographic biases: A well-distributed literature body across space helps us infer global patterns of land-use change, identify regional mechanisms, and highlight threatened areas. Of the 4108 abstracts mentioning species, 3213 also mentioned a geographic location. Of the 147 countries mentioned, the United States appeared most often, with roughly the same number of mentions (480) as the next five countries combined (Figure 
In Russia, the Middle East, and Africa we found very few studies despite some hotspots in South Africa and Tanzania. The blank spots on the map-where there are few or no identified studies-reveal gaps in our knowledge of region-specific land-use change drivers and how they may be impacting ecological communities. In the conservation literature at least, research in Africa and Southeast Asia appears to be stagnant or even decreasing over time, exacerbating their underrepresentation (Di

Based on the coordinates of subcountry locations, we detected a surplus of studies in all temperate biomes, accounting for over half of all locations. This abundance, and disparity with global area, was most apparent for temperate forest biomes. The most underrepresented biomes regarding land area are deserts and xeric shrublands, tundra, and boreal forests. Insufficient sampling of arid regions could hamper conservation efforts as 
Community responses to land-use change can vary geographically due to the specific nature of threats and differences in species sensitivity  | | Further dimensions of land-use change:  | | The role of climate: Land use and climate change interact with the implications for the distribution and persistence of species 
In our analysis, we found that the climatic distribution of landuse study locations did not match with the pattern of global terrestrial climate (Figure 
The narrow climatic range of this research body may have several consequences as the richness of taxonomic groups peak in different climate zones  | | Land-use history: Extensive and persistent influences of humans date back thousands of years in some regions 
Global maps of land-use history can help us identify prime regions for investigating the role of legacy effects and recovery times (Figure 
Synthesizing land-use change research requires covering the full diversity of land-use histories and understanding time-lagged biotic responses. We found that studies in areas with sustained human use (>20% of area used) until the present all had a higher share of studies than their global coverage suggests (Figure 
The disparity in magnitude is particularly evident for areas with greater than 2000 years of sustained use, and areas with 100-250 years of sustained use. Coverage of these two extremes F I G U R E 7 Representation of land-use histories as the percent of location mentions within each category versus global cover. Land-use histories identified from 
In some regions, human impacts have declined from previous levels and what appear to be pristine ecosystems may actually be recovering. Forests regrowing after agricultural abandonment, for example, can display the legacy effects lasting millennia 
The geographic bias of studies limits the applicability of findings and the reliability of future projections. Investigating the full diversity of regional land-use mechanisms will be key to determining a global outlook. A bias toward forest ecosystems may be at the expense of other diverse habitats including tropical and subtropical savannas and grasslands. A key challenge moving forward will be ex-  | | PER S PEC TIVE S: To improve our understanding of how land-use change affects biodiversity, we need to investigate both sides of the paradigm in greater detail through improvements in land use and biodiversity data as well as study designs (Figure 
Land use and biodiversity surveys across large extents (e.g., nationally) are important but need to be aligned spatially and temporally.
Moving forward, we must also put more attention on the legacies of historical human disturbance when monitoring biodiversity and pursue further research into the interaction of land-use change with other global drivers 
Geographic and taxonomic biases underpin many of the challenges facing this field. However, neither can be solved with the data that we currently have. Filling these gaps will require concerted fieldwork on neglected taxonomic groups in understudied regions, with an emphasis on collaborative research efforts. The advancement of space-borne remote sensing will also be pivotal. Global submeter resolution maps of vegetation and land use will be invaluable for tackling geographic biases when coupled with fieldwork in understudied systems. Proximal sensing methods such as camera traps, drones, sound recorders, and climate loggers will also help increase the effectiveness of data collection. We cannot make effective conservation and policy decisions on what we do not fully understand.

Land Use/Land Cover Changes and Their Driving Factors in the Northeastern Tibetan Plateau Based on Geographical Detectors and Google Earth Engine: A Case Study in Gannan Prefecture,Chenli Liu; Wenlong Li; Gaofeng Zhu; Huakun Zhou; Hepiao Yan; Pengfei Xue,"As an important production base for livestock and a unique ecological zone in China, the northeast Tibetan Plateau has experienced dramatic land use/land cover (LULC) changes with increasing human activities and continuous climate change. However, extensive cloud cover limits the ability of optical remote sensing satellites to monitor accurately LULC changes in this area. To overcome this problem in LULC mapping in the Ganan Prefecture, 2000-2018, we used the dense time stacking of multi-temporal Landsat images and random forest algorithm based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The dynamic trends of LULC changes were analyzed, and geographical detectors quantitatively evaluated the key driving factors of these changes. The results showed that (1) the overall classification accuracy varied between 89.14% and 91.41%, and the kappa values were greater than 86.55%, indicating that the classification results were reliably accurate. (2) The major LULC types in the study area were grassland and forest, and their area accounted for 50% and 25%, respectively. During the study period, the grassland area decreased, while the area of forest land and construction land increased to varying degrees. The land-use intensity presents multi-level intensity, and it was higher in the northeast than that in the southwest. (3) Elevation and population density were the major driving factors of LULC changes, and economic development has also significantly affected LULC. These findings revealed the main factors driving LULC changes in Gannan Prefecture and provided a reference for assisting in the development of sustainable land management and ecological protection policy decisions.","Introduction: Land use/land cover (LULC) changes are the most basic and prominent landscape characteristic describing the impact of anthropogenic disturbance on the surface of the Earth and play an important role in the studies of regional and global environmental changes 
There are currently great uncertainties and differences among existing global LULC products due to different data sources, methods, and classification systems. Furthermore, most previous studies were concerned about long-term vegetation change on the TP 
However, the processing of multi-source satellite data is a huge challenge for computing capacity. Currently, a free cloud platform provides new methods for geospatial analysis. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) can avoid the process of image downloading and preprocessing and hence greatly improve the efficiency of LULC change research 
The driving force analysis can determine the process of LULC changes and reveal the regional ecological environment change mechanism 
Gannan Prefecture is an important water supply area for the Yellow River, located in the northeast TP. This area plays an important role in conserving water sources, maintaining biodiversity, and regulating climate 
This study applied dense time stacking of Landsat images to monitor LULC changes in Gannan Prefecture and explored its driving factors based on geographical detectors. We aimed to (1) obtain the LULC information of Gannan Prefecture 2000-2018 based on the GEE platform, (2) analyze the spatiotemporal change pattern of land-use intensity in Gannan Prefecture, and (3) identify the main socioeconomic and natural factors affecting LULC changes using geographical detectors. The results are expected to provide theoretical support for adjusting and optimizing land use in Gannan Prefecture. | Materials and Methods:  | Study Area: The Gannan Prefecture is within the alpine pastoral region in the southwest of Gansu Province, located in the transition zone between the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP) and the Loess Plateau (Figure

Supervised classification methods require high-quality training and validation samples. Training samples used to create the classification model were collected through visual interpretation and field observations  | Anthropogenic and Natural Data: Because anthropogenic and natural factors profoundly influence LULC changes, 11 potential factors were selected in this study to detect their influence on LULC changes in Gannan Prefecture in 2000, 2009, and 2018 (Figure

we collected more than 1323 reference points in 2000, 2009, and 2018, covering seven LULC types (Supplementary Materials Figure  | Anthropogenic and Natural Data: Because anthropogenic and natural factors profoundly influence LULC changes, 11 potential factors were selected in this study to detect their influence on LULC changes in Gannan Prefecture in 2000, 2009, and 2018 (Figure  | Methods: We used Landsat images based on the dense time stack of multi-temporal Landsat images to generate a cloudless and minimal snow cover image on the GEE platform.

The specific research methods and structural framework are shown in Figure  | LULC Classification and Accuracy Assessment: We selected a random forest (RF) algorithm as the classifier because it generally has greater processing power for data noise and overfitting 
An accuracy assessment is necessary for LULC classification to explain the correspondence between ground truth and classification results  | LULC Classification and Accuracy Assessment: We selected a random forest (RF) algorithm as the classifier because it generally has greater processing power for data noise and overfitting 
An accuracy assessment is necessary for LULC classification to explain the correspondence between ground truth and classification results  | Land Use Degree Index: Land-use intensity is the most intuitive representation of human activity and can directly reflect the state of LULC 
where La is the land use degree index value; A i is the hierarchical index of land use degree i; C i is the percentage of the graded area of land use degree of category i. According to the previous studies of Zhuang et al.  | Geographical Detector: The geographical detector model is a spatial heterogeneity detection method usually used to quantify the driving force of each factor on the dependent variable 
where q is the explanatory power index of the influencing factors of land use degree. The greater the q value, the greater the effect of the independent variable x on the heterogeneity of land use. N h is the number of samples of the sub-regions h; N is the total sample size; œÉ and œÉ 2 denote the total variance and variance of samples in sub-region h, respectively. | Results:  | Variable Importance Analysis and Accuracy Assessment of LULC Classification: The RF model can analyze the importance of characteristic variables, which improves classification accuracy while reducing data redundancy and processing workload. We used the explain method on the classifier to view the importance of characteristic parameters on the GEE platform. The higher the importance score indicated, the greater the impact and contribution of the variable to the classification results. Our results showed that elevation had the highest importance score among all the characteristic variables; its average value was greater than 1100 (Figure 
Remote Sens. 2020, 12, x 8 of 18 MNDWI, and NDVI followed, and they are more important for the identification of water body and vegetation. The importance score of other characteristic variables for LULC classification remained stable (Figure  | Spatiotemporal Characteristics of LULC Changes: The LULC maps of Gannan Prefecture in 2000, 2009, and 2018 are shown in Figure  | Spatiotemporal Characteristics of LULC Changes: The LULC maps of Gannan Prefecture in 2000, 2009, and 2018 are shown in Figure  | Spatiotemporal Characteristics of LULC Changes: The LULC maps of Gannan Prefecture in 2000, 2009, and 2018 are shown in Figure  | LULC Transformation: To observe the changes in various LULC types, we used the spatial analysis method to create the 2000-2018 LULC changes transition matrix and mapped them. From 2000 to 2009, in general, grassland and wetlands decreased, and farmland, forest land, and construction land expanded (Figures 
grassland and wetlands decreased, and farmland, forest land, and construction land expanded (Figures 
Similarly, from 2009 to 2018, the areas of farmland and grassland continued to decrease, while forest land, wetland, and unused land expanded (Figures 
Similarly, from 2009 to 2018, the areas of farmland and grassland continued to decrease, while forest land, wetland, and unused land expanded (Figures 
Comparing the spatial-temporal changes in LULC between 2000-2009 and 2009-2018, we found that the farmland area increased first and then decreased, but the wetland area followed the opposite trend. In general, between 2000-2018, the grassland was continuously degraded, and the area under forest land and construction land gradually increased. The water body area did not change much, and the area of unused land also increased, which was mainly caused by grassland and water body shrinkage. | Degree of Land Use Change: We calculated the dynamic degree of land use based on the LULC dataset of Gannan Prefecture. The spatial changes in land-use intensity represent diversified types and multi-level intensity, and the overall land-use intensity in the northeast was higher than that in the southwest (Figure

The calculated q values of anthropogenic and natural factors (Table  | Discussion:  | Analysis of LULC Classification Variable Importance and Result Verification: This study constructed various characteristic variables on the GEE platform and used the RF machine algorithm to classify LULC in Gannan Prefecture. The RF algorithm provides flexibility to include different data types in the modeling process and accurately classifies the LULC heterogeneity 
The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were reasonable, as, according to the USGS survey, the recommended threshold is 85%, and Gashaw et al.  | Temporal-Spatial Variation of LULC Changes: LULC changes are influenced by the interaction between humans and the environment at different spatial and temporal scales. Monitoring LULC changes can help us understand the causes of their dynamic changes, and it supports land management and decision-making 
The change in land-use intensity reflects the disturbance degree of human activities on natural resources  | Major Drivers of LULC Changes: LULC is a complex process affected by natural, social, and economic factors. Here, we explain the driving mechanism of LULC changes by analyzing the relative importance of natural and human disturbances. Generally, LULC changes are greatly affected by human activities. Our results showed that from 2000 to 2018, population density explained much of the LULC changes. This finding agrees with previous reports that the LULC changes driven by human activities are increasing 
LULC changes are also closely related to natural factors  | Advantages and Limitations of the Current Study: The GEE cloud computing platform has unique computing capabilities, free satellite images, integrated APIs, and researchers can process massive geographic data 
Factor detection found that the influence of natural factors on LULC changes in Gannan Prefecture is greater than the influence of the anthropogenic factors, which might be caused by the fragile ecological environment and lack of investment and transportation  | Conclusions: The study used the dense time stacking of multi-temporal Landsat images and the RF machine learning algorithm to map the LULC in Gannan Prefecture, and then analyze potential driving forces based on geographic detectors. Our results demonstrated that from 2000 to 2018, Gannan Prefecture was dominated by grassland, followed by forest land and farmland. Grasslands and wetlands gradually degraded from 2000 to 2018, while forest land, construction land, and unused land expanded. Grassland was mainly converted to forest land. The high land-use intensity was distributed in Lintan, northern Xiahe, and Hezuo. The overall land-use intensity of Gannan Prefecture was higher in the northeast than in the southwest, and these areas are relatively flat, mainly consisting of cultivated land and construction land. In addition, the importance analysis of all variables using the RF model found that elevation was the most important characteristic variable for LULC classification in Gannan Prefecture.
The driving factor analysis also found that elevation was the most important factor affecting the LULC in Gannan Prefecture. However, with economic development, the driving effects of anthropogenic factors on the LULC have gradually expanded. In 2018, population density, GDP, livestock quantity, and chemical fertilizer consumption had an explanatory power exceeding 0.3117 for LULC changes, which indicates that economic development has promoted LULC changes. In conclusion, our study results indicate that elevation restricts the dominant factors of LULC changes in alpine regions.

"Application of Remote Sensing Tools to Assess the Land Use and Land Cover Change in Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, Mexico",Dimitrios Paraforos; Anselme Muzirafuti; Josept David Revuelta-Acost; Edna Suhail Guerrero-Lu; Jose Terrazas-Rodriguez; Cristian Gomez-Rodriguez; Gerardo Perea,"Land use and land cover (LULC) change has become an important research topic for global environmental change and sustainable development. As an important part of worldwide land conservation, sustainable development and management of water resources, developing countries must ensure the use of innovative technology and tools that support their various decision making systems. This study provides the most recent LULC change analysis for the last six years (2015-2021) of Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, Mexico, one of the most important petrochemical cities in the world and host of the ongoing Interoceanic Corridor project. The analysis was carried out using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite images, ancillary data and ground-based surveys and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to identify and to ameliorate the discrimination between four main macro-classes and fourteen classes. The LULC classification was performed using the maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) to produce maps for each year, as it was found to be the best approach when compared to minimum distance (MDM) and spectral angle mapping (SAM) methods. The macro-classes were water, built-up, vegetation and bare soil, whereas the classes were an improved classification within those. Our study achieved both user accuracy (UA) and producer accuracy (PA) above 90% for the proposed macro-classes and classes. The average Kappa coefficient for macro-classes was 0.93, while for classes it was 0.96, both comparable to previous studies. The results from the LULC analysis show that residential, industry and commercial areas slowed down their growth throughout the study period. These changes were associated with socioeconomical drivers such as insecurity and lack of economic investments. Groves and trees presented steady behaviors, with small increments during the five-year period. Swamps, on the other hand, significantly degraded, being about 2% of the study area in 2015 and 0.93% in 2021. Dunes and medium and high vegetation densities (‚àº 80%) transitioned mostly to low vegetation densities. This behavior is associated with rainfall below the annual reference and increments of surface runoff due to the loss of vegetation cover. Lastly, the present study seeks to highlight the importance of remote sensing for a better understanding of the dynamics between human-nature interactions and to provide information to assist planners and decision-makers for more sustainable land development.","Introduction: Land use and land cover (LULC) changes are among the research topics more recurrent in remote sensing 
Some of the more remarkable research found in literature is the work conducted by Yuan et al. 
In Mexico, little research related to the quantification of LULC changes has been found within the literary review. One of the few works found was carried out by Colditz et al. 
Due to the limitations observed in the use of remote sensing in Mexico, such as limited research using remote sensing and map course resolution, this study has integrated remote sensing, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis, field sampling and image revision to assess the potential of the use of Landsat 8 satellite data to assess and monitor land use changes and coverage changes in the southeastern region of the state of Veracruz, Mexico, located in the southern coastal area of the Gulf of Mexico. Three widely used classification methods are explored to select the more appropriate algorithm for LULC classification under the same level of information previously extracted from field data, digital maps and ancillary data. This comparison allows for conclusions on the advantages and drawbacks of current classification algorithms. The analysis encompasses the definitions of macro-classes of land use and their derived classes. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, also known as NDVI, was used to identify and improve discrimination between macro-classes and classes within the study area. A supervised classification method, the Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), was applied in this study due to its availability within the GIS applications in addition to it not requiring an extensive training process 
Additionally, this study proposes a methodology to obtain updated temporal information of the change in land use and land cover for the Coatzacoalcos area using Landsat 8 satellite imagery, which has a higher resolution with the available MODIS maps. The mapping of land use and its changes are critical and important factors for sustainable development as well as the monitoring of environmental impacts. The final product of this research will help government agencies to make decisions on urban development and preservation of available natural resources, since one of the emblematic projects in Mexico known as the Interoceanic Corridor is being executed in the present year. Lastly, this piece of research is going to serve as the baseline for additional contributions on LULC change prediction with more complex analyses of the drivers forcing these landscape modifications. | Materials and Methods:  | Study Area: The study area is the southeastern region of the state of Veracruz, Mexico, in which one of the most important pretrochemical ports of the country is located at the city of Coatzacoalcos. This city is surrounded by the Coatzacoalcos and Tonal√° rivers and extends between latitudes 18.06 ‚Ä¢ and 18.21 ‚Ä¢ and longitudes -94.22 ‚Ä¢ and -94.64 ‚Ä¢ (Figure 
Physiographically, the study area has an average elevation of 10 meters above sea level. The soils found in the region are clayey lateritic Acrisol and Luvisol in high elevations and Gleysol, Cambisol, Vertisol and Nitosol in plains  | Data Acquisition and Processing: The images used in this study were obtained from the Landsat 8 satellite, which captures multispectral images of 30 m resolution sampled with the OLI (Operational Land Imager) sensor. The Landsat 8 satellite also provides a 15 m panchromatic band, allowing for a greater spatial resolution. All images were geometrically corrected and acquired in level 1 (L1). The images can be directly downloaded from the EarthExplorer gateway of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) 
where œÅ s is the surface reflectance, d is the distance to the sun, ESUN Œª is the mean solar exo-atmospheric irradiance, L Œª is the solar spectral radiance to the satellite, Œ∏ s is the zenith angle and Œª p is the path radiance given by 
where L min is the radiance corresponding to a digital count value for which the sum of all the pixels with digital counts lower than or equal to this value is equal to 0.01% of all the pixels from the image considered  | NDVI Classification: Based on the interpretation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the analysis of Google-Earth-extracted images, RGB (red, green, blue) images, panchromatic bands and ground-based georeferenced information, NDVI thresholds were proposed to classify the area of study into four macro-classes during the analysis period (2015-2021), as shown in Table 
where œÜ nir is the near-infrared reflectance and œÜ red is the red-band reflectance. Band 4 (0.64-0.67 ¬µm) and band 5 (0.85-0.88 ¬µm) represent œÜ nir and œÜ red , respectively, in the Landsat products. The NDVI values vary from -1 to 1. Values close to 1 represent vegetation in optimal environmental conditions, whereas low values of NDVI indicate low vegetation density or a different land use. After the macro-class definition, a second classification was performed to refine the LULC characteristics through a more extensive discrimination of pixels. These new classes were defined according to the CORINE land cover inventory proposed by the European Environmental Agency  | Classifier Comparison: In addition to its social and environmental objectives, this study seeks to evaluate the potential and the drawbacks of the minimum distance classifier 
where x is the spectral signature vector of an image, y is the spectral signature vector of the training area and n is the number of bands of the image. Once the spectral distance is computed for every pixel, the class with the closest spectral signature to the training set is assigned according to the following discrimination function 
where C k is the land cover macro-class or class, y k is the spectral signature of class k and y j is the spectral signature of class j. This equation is valid when k = j. | Spectral Angle Mapping Classifier: The spectral angle mapping (SAM) algorithm computes the spectral angle between the spectral signatures of the image pixels and the training spectral signatures. The spectral angle Œ∏ is given by
Thus, a pixel resides in the macro-class or class that has the lowest spectral angle, as provided by
where k = j. | Maximum Likelihood Classifier: The maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) is based on the probability that a pixel belongs to or is within macro-classes or a particular class 
The MLC algorithm calculates the weighted distance or probability D that an unknown value in the vector M p belongs to one of the macro-classes or classes M c . This likelihood is based on the Bayesian equation 
where D is the weighted distance or probability, c is a particular macro-class or class, M p is the measurement vector of the candidate pixel, M c is the mean vector of the sample of macro-class or class c, a c is the percentage probability of any pixel belonging to the macro-class or class c, Cov c is the covariance matrix of the pixels in the sampled macro-class or class c, |Cov c | is the determinant of the matrix Cov c , Cov c-1 is the inverse of Cov c and T is the transposition function. | Precision Assessment: The analysis of the accuracy is an important step for the evaluation of the resulting classification because the users of the information, once the classification is performed, need to know how accurate the result is in order to use the data in their decision making. A minimum level of overall precision for a selected macro-class or class of at least 85%, according to the recommendations found in similar works 
where N is the sample size, W i is the mapped area proportion of the class i, S i is the standard deviation of the stratum i and So is the expected standard deviation of overall accuracy, often valued at 0.01  | Validation Point Estimation: The number of samples calculated with Equation (  | Results: This section is divided into four main subsections: First, the analysis of the land use and its spatial distribution at macro-class level is presented. Second, an analysis at class level is performed, similar to the one conducted in the first section. Third, an assessment of the land use change from 2015 to 2021 is carried out as a study case, and, lastly, a discussion of the possible drivers forcing land use change is established. | LULC Classifier Assessment and Selection: The three classification methods were run for the seven-year period proposed in this analysis. Results show a similar behavior for extracting LULC information using the same level of ancillary data. This condition allowed a fair comparison between the classification algorithms. Figure 
Numerically, all the classification methods presented good behavior for both overall precision and Kappa values, all being above 85% and 0.85, respectively (Table  | Macro-Class-Based LULC Classification: The classification based on macro-classes represented a course scheme to generate four of the main land uses found in Coatzacoalcos. These macro-classes are water, built-up, vegetation and bare soil. The spatial distribution of them can be observed in Figure 
Additionally, Figure  | Class-Based LULC Classification: A class-based LULC classification was conducted to identify a more discrete evolution of the land use within the study period. This identification will help prioritize the location of areas that require ecological attention, the inclusion of best management practices (BMP) for water and soil conservation as well as a more appropriate location of the upcoming urbanization due to the Interoceanic Corridor project execution. At this level, we identified that pixels representing the sea did not change significantly. This behavior can be observed in Figure 
Man-made construction was divided into industry, residential, commercial and roads classes. Industry shows a constant percentage from 2016 to 2021. The only change occurred in 2015. The industrial area called Etileno XXI, the largest petrochemical complex in Latin America, concluded 99.2% of its construction in 2015 
Vegetation plays an important role in our natural ecosystem and also holds up the biosphere in various ways. Vegetation helps to regulate the flow of numerous biogeochemical cycles, most importantly those of nitrogen, carbon and water. It also contributes to the local and global energy balances. In this study, the classes within vegetation included mixed forest, shrubland, wetland and dune. Figure 
Dunes, in Figure 
Table 
For the sake of simplicity, only the most significant changes are discussed here. Residential land use grew only 0.88 km 2 during the last six years, which reflects a very small growth in comparison with that of industrial cities in Mexico, which has been characterized as about 5% per year  | Discussion: LULC changes measure the transitions of different land uses in complex interactions between humans and the physical environment  | Conclusions: This paper determined land use and land cover (LULC) over the period 2015-2021 for the city of Coatzacoalcos and its metropolitan area, located in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. Based on images from Landsat 8, MLC, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), NVDI spectral index and field data, the annual land use variability was produced up-todate as reliable information for decision making and ecosystem preservation during the execution of the ongoing project called the Interoceanic Corridor. This project represents Mexico's narrowest stretch between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans and the expansion and modernization of Coatzacoalcos and Salina Cruz ports.
The objective of this study was to provide the most recent information on land use spatial distribution that Coatzacoalcos experienced in the last six years and to improve the current available course resolution maps. The satisfactory results can be summarized in four main aspects: (1) built-up areas, including industry, residential and commercial areas, have slowed down their growth due to socio-economical drivers such as security and null monetary investments; (2) vegetation such as mixed forest and low density vegetation (bare surfaces, sparse vegetation and grassland) has been sustained and increased over time due to reforestation or migration from other classes; (3) swamps experienced considerable degradation over the past five years and (4) high and medium vegetation densities have transformed mostly to low vegetation densities due to climate drives such as low precipitation and possible high soil evaporation, which might also increase the overland flow for those areas.
Lastly, this study demonstrated the use of free available Landsat data and their processing by open source tools. It provided an accurate approach to mapping and assessing LULC changes over time. This methodology can be applied similarly for longer periods of time and other satellite products and contributes to improving the number of applications of remote sensing and research in Mexico and other developing countries.  | Appendix A: ","Remote Sensing of Land Use and Land Cover (, , 2012) || Finer resolution observation and monitoring of global land cover: First mapping results with Landsat TM and ETM+ data (, , , , , , , , , , 2013) || Utilization of Landsat data to quantify land-use and land-cover changes related to oil and gas activities in West-Central Alberta from 2005 to (, , , , 2013. 2017) || Analysis on Land-Use Change and Its Driving Mechanism in Xilingol, China, during 2000-2020 Using the Google Earth Engine (, , , , , ) || Land use/land cover changes in the coastal zone of Ban Don Bay, Thailand using Landsat 5 TM data (, , 2005) || Land cover change in Europe between 1950 and 2000 determined employing aerial photography (, , , , , , , , , , 2010) || Landsat remote sensing of forest windfall disturbance (, , , , , , 2012) || Land-cover change dynamics and insights into ecosystem services in European stream riparian zones (, , , 2014) || Assessing the impacts of climate and land use and land cover change on the freshwater availability in the Brahmaputra River basin (, , 2015) || Impacts of forest cover change on ecosystem services in high Andean mountains (, , , , 2015) || Assessment of land cover change hotspots in Gulf of Kachchh, India using multi-temporal remote sensing data and GIS (, , , , , 2016) || Remote sensing in mangrove research-relationship between vegetation indices and dendrometric parameters: A case for Coringa, east coast of India (, , , , , November 2001) || Evaluation of the consistency of MODIS Land Cover Product (MCD12Q1) based on Chinese 30 m GlobeLand30 datasets: A case study in Anhui Province (, , , , , , 2015) || WebGIS Implementation for Dynamic Mapping and Visualization of Coastal Geospatial Data: A Case Study of BESS Project (, , , , , , , , , , ) || Mapping of Sicilian Pocket Beaches Land Use/Land Cover with Sentinel-2 Imagery: A Case Study of Messina Province (, , , , , , 2021) || Designing a European-Wide Crop Type Mapping Approach Based on Machine Learning Algorithms Using LUCAS Field Survey and Sentinel-2 Data (, , , , , , ) ||  (, 10 December 2021) || Preliminary analysis of LANDSAT-4 Thematic Mapper (, , , , , 1983) || American landscape characterization dataset development and data fusion issues (, , , , , 1998) || Landsat's role in ecological applications of remote sensing (, , 2004) || Forestry information content of Thematic Mapper data (, , , 2007) || Introduction to Remote Sensing, 4 (, 2007) || Modeling and Prediction of Land Use Land Cover Change Dynamics Based on Land Change Modeler (LCM) in Nashe Watershed (, , , 2021) || Comparing two approaches to land use/cover change modeling and their implications for the assessment of biodiversity loss in a deciduous tropical forest (, , , 2012) || Landscape transformation processes in two large and two small cities in Egypt and Jordan over the last five decades using remote sensing data (, , , , 2020. 103766) || Changes in agricultural land use in the context of ongoing transformational processes in Slovakia (, , , , 2013) || Land cover classification and change analysis of the Twin Cities (Minnesota) Metropolitan Area by multitemporal Landsat remote sensing (, , , , 2005) || Land use/Land cover changes and their causes in Libokemkem District of South Gonder (, , , , 2017) || Generation and analysis of the 2005 land cover map for Mexico using 250 m MODIS data (, , , , , , , , , 2012) || A land cover map of Latin America and the Caribbean in the framework of the SERENA project (, , , , , , , , , , 2013) || Mapping ancient chinampa landscapes in the Basin of Mexico: a remote sensing and GIS approach (, 2012) || Evolution of the 2014-2015 sea surface temperature warming in the central west coast of Baja California, Mexico, recorded by remote sensing (, 2016) || Assessment for a Run-of-River (RoR) Scheme Using a Rectangular Mesh Sweeping Approach (MSA) Based on GIS.

Detecting land use and land cover change on Barbuda before and after the Hurricane Irma with respect to potential land grabbing: A combined volunteered geographic information and multi sensor approach,Andreas Rienow; Jan Schweigh√∂fer; Torben Dedring; Marcus Goebel; Valerie Graw,"Two months after the hurricanes Irma and Maria hit Barbuda, the construction of a new international airport led to accusations of degrading the Codrington Lagoon National Park and contravening the conventions of the Ramsar Program. Scientists have analyzed the aftermath with respect to historical legacies, disaster capitalism, manifestation of climate injustices and green gentrification. The main objective of this study was to quantify and allocate land use and land cover change (LULCC) in Barbuda before and after the 2017 Hurricane disasters. Remote sensing data and volunteered geographic information were analyzed to detect the potential changes in natural LULC so that human activities and the emergence of artificial surfaces could be detected. Human-induced LULCC occurred at different sites on the island, with decreased activities in Codrington, but increased and continued activities at Coco and Palmetto Points. With an accuracy of 97.1 %, we estimated a total increase of vegetated areas by 6.56 km 2 , and a simultaneous slight increase in roads and buildings with a total length of 249.67 km and a total area of 1.43 km 2 . The vegetation condition itself depict a steady decrease since 2017. New hotspots of human activity emerged on the island in the Codrington Lagoon National Park.","Introduction: ""Buy land, God doesn't create any more."" This aphorism by Mark Twain can be considered as the guiding principle for humankind, evident from the steadily increasing global land consumption. Accordingly, the term ""land grab"" was coined and is related to the increased number of large-scale and commercial land deals by international actors 
A. Rienow et al. 
Scientists have analyzed the effect of severe storms with respect to historical legacies and reconstruction politics 
This study addresses the following research questions:
1) Where is human-induced LULCC taking place on Barbuda and how accurate can it be allocated? 2) To what extent is LULCC occuring on Barbuda and how can it be quantified? 3) How does LULCC on Barbuda has changed before and after Hurricane Irma in terms of location and quantity?
This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the historical role of land in defining the identity of the Barbudans. Section 3 presents the data and methods used in the study that are multispectral remote sensing-based LULCC classification, very high-resolution satellite imagery, nighttime lights, and volunteered geographic information gathered through Ohsome API and Twitters' Twarc 2 API. Section 4 presents the results of human-induced LULC regarding allocation, quantity, and dynamics before and after the severe Hurricanes 2017. A short conclusion and future research directions are presented in section 5. | Study site -Barbuda and the role of land to a distinctive identity: Barbuda is a Caribbean Island in the Lesser Antilles with an area of 161 km 2 and a population of 1,886 (projection based on Census 2011, https://statistics.gov.ag/) (Fig. 
The relationship of Barbuda with its larger sister island in the colonial nation state of Antigua and Barbuda, is characterized by a historically developed subordination of Barbuda to Antigua  | Data and methods: For the assessment of artificial LULCC and human activity on the ground, we mainly utilized two data sources: 1) remotely sensed satellite data and 2) in situ mapped volunteered geographic information. We processed Sentinel-1 (S-1), Sentinel-2 (S-2), NOAA VIIRS data, MODIS Terra, and RapidEye data, and obtained data from the OSM archive via the Ohsome API and Twitter via twarc2 API (2). Thus, procured highresolution (5-10 m scale) quantitative and regional information on LULCC before and after the Hurricane disasters in September 2017, and on-ground information on the artificial LULC. The nighttime light (NTL) imagery enabled the assessment of dynamic human activity (Fig. 
The LULCC analysis of Barbuda Island was performed using satellite imagery acquired from (S-2) and (S-1) data. Atmospherically corrected Level 2 data that had a cloud cover < 10 % were used. Subsequently, annual samples were created based on simple median filter methods for 2016-2017 (before September 5, 2017) and 2019-2020 (Fig. 
In order to derive more information on the vegetation condition, we have also acquired data of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra and Aqua Satellites 
According to 
Considering a baseline between 2000 and 2020, MODIS Terra NDVI (MOD13Q1) 16-day composites at 250 m resolution were used to calculate the mean annual VCI for each year between 2015 and 2020. | Table 1: Acquired and processed NTL data from the VIIRS. In order to remotely assess human activities, night light emissions are a simple and effective option 
The utilized satellite data have spatial resolutions of 10 m and 5 m, which is still too coarse to detect smaller residential buildings in Codrington. We enhanced the satellite-based samples with Open Street Map (OSM) feature data to accurately differentiate between vegetated and non-vegetated and artificial and non-artificial areas. OSM is the most commonly used volunteered geographic information system in the world 
Note that the mapping activities enhanced in the aftermath of the 2017 Hurricanes (Fig. 
The study wants to contribute to the discourse of land grabbing, neocolonialism, and disaster capitalism by enriching spatially explicit geoinformation with impressions of Barbudan LULCC from the Twitter community. Although the most used social medium in Barbuda is Facebook, we have chosen Twitter since it reflects both: international news and official statements as well as local opinions on those. We set up a scientific developer account and accessed the full Twitter archive via the twarc2 API (Twarc-Project, 2021). We conducted an ""all of these words"" search for collecting tweets containing the words ""barbuda land change"" and ""barbuda plh"". We used the Natural Language Toolkit, comprising the Jupiter ""vader"" and ""stopwords"" lexicons, to build a Python program to analyze the collected tweets  | Results and discussion: Progress in the development of the Barbudan Ocean Club has already been observed via Twitter.

The quantitative results of the classification based on S-1 and S-2 are presented in Table 
Fig. 
The limitations of the remote sensing approach with MODIS or even Sentinel data is the resolution, which is too coarse for the detection of small Barbudan houses and the sampling methods. To overcome the problem of clouded imagery, we created annual median samples, which did not cover the seasonal effects. However, the quantification and allocation of vegetated and non-vegetated areas and their changes before and after the Hurricane can be carried out with an accuracy of 0.97. The kind of land use, i.e., housing, agricultural area, cannot be detected with the proposed approach.
Accordingly, we assessed the development of settlement structures using the Ohsome API (Fig. 
Note that the unpaved under construction area of the international airport in the center of the islandthe main reason for the letter of UN to the Government of Barbuda 
To add further value to the potential human-induced LULCC analyses based on remote sensing and OSM data, we analyzed the archive of the NOAA VIIRS DNB (Fig.  | Conclusion: The study was conducted to quantify the LULCC in Barbuda in the context of the ongoing debate on neocolonialism and land grabbing. Geospatial data, such as multispectral satellite images or voluntarily mapped OSM features provide an objective representation of the real world. Spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions and different mapping intensities can be considered as the limitations to this approach. Therefore, we combined different types and strengths of geospatial data, such as the broad spectrum of remote sensing data that can visualize geospatial characteristics, which are invisible to the human eye, and in situ information derived by local mappers. We observed that humaninduced LULCC is occurring on different sites on the island, with decreased activities in Codrington, but increased and ongoing activities leading to a LULCC in Coco Point and Palmetto Point. With an accuracy of 97.1 %, we estimated a total increase of vegetated areas by 6.56 km 2 and simultaneous increase in roads and buildings with a total length of 249.67 km and a total area of 1.43 km 2 ; this includes the area of the under construction central international airport. The satellite classification measures an area of ~ 1.09 km 2 , which is ten times the combined sum of all the buildings mapped with the OSM. This and the fact that the vegetation condition itself depict a steady decrease since 2017 show the severe human-induced LULCC since the hurricanes Irma and Maria hit Barbuda and led to its temporary evacuation. While some places show a decrease in human activity, such as Codrington and the Lighthouse Bay Resort, other places experienced increased human activities. They became new NTL radiance hotspots on the island. Since these hotspots are the sites of the Barbudan Ocean Club, the dispute along the humaninduced LULCC in the aftermath of the 2017 Hurricanes will and needs to be continued. It should be acknowledged that the Nobu Inn and the Palmetto Point site of the PLH are already under construction despite the international attention and applicable Barbudan land law. Hence, future work on geospatial analyses needs to focus on the connection between land rights and land development in Barbuda. While the Copernicus program does not provide data below 10 m spatial resolution, the base maps of the NICFI program could be an alternative; they are currently flawed by artifacts, geometric distortions, and atmospheric radiances. The OSM database needs to be updated so that the recently developed hotels and the international airport construction site can be found in the maps. Finally, landscape transformation needs to be analyzed with respect to the common wealth of the Barbudan citizens, and its impacts on the unique ecosystem of Barbuda.    | CRediT authorship contribution statement: ","Period Scenes Jun-Aug (, 2015) || The Manifestation of Climate Injustices: The Post-Hurricane Irma Conflicts Surrounding Barbuda's Communal Land Tenure (, , 2019) || Is a pixel worth 1000 words?

Land Use and Land Cover Change Modeling and Future Potential Landscape Risk Assessment Using Markov-CA Model and Analytical Hierarchy Process,Biswajit Nath; Zhihua Wang; Yong Ge; Kamrul Islam; Ramesh Singh; Zheng Niu,"Land use and land cover change (LULCC) has directly played an important role in the observed climate change. In this paper, we considered Dujiangyan City and its environs (DCEN) to study the future scenario in the years 2025, 2030, and 2040 based on the 2018 simulation results from 2007 and 2018 LULC maps. This study evaluates the spatial and temporal variations of future LULCC, including the future potential landscape risk (FPLR) area of the 2008 great (8.0 M w ) earthquake of south-west China. The Cellular automata-Markov chain (CA-Markov) model and multicriteria based analytical hierarchy process (MC-AHP) approach have been considered using the integration of remote sensing and GIS techniques. The analysis shows future LULC scenario in the years 2025, 2030, and 2040 along with the FPLR pattern. Based on the results of the future LULCC and FPLR scenarios, we have provided suggestions for the development in the close proximity of the fault lines for the future strong magnitude earthquakes. Our results suggest a better and safe planning approach in the Belt and Road Corridor (BRC) of China to control future Silk-Road Disaster, which will also be useful to urban planners for urban development in a safe and sustainable manner.","Introduction: The land use land cover change and its modeling (LULCC-M) approach has recently been considered by the scientific community to observe environmental changes at level 4, such as local, regional, national, and global. To achieve the Sustainable Development Goals framework designed by the United Nations (UN) 2030, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been considered worldwide. Changes above level 4 are heavily impacted by natural hazards, i.e., earthquakes, floods, landslides, and forest fires. The term 'land use and land cover changes' (LULCC) refers to human modifications of the terrestrial surface of the earth, as well as the study of land surface change 
To support LULCC, land-use change models (LUCM) are considered as effective tools to analyze the causes and consequences of land-use change. Moreover, the LULC model is found to be effective when predicting the future state and spatial distribution of LULC using the gained knowledge from previous years 
Numerous methods, such as mathematical-equation-based, spatiotemporal modeling 
CA-Markov initial conditions, parameterization of the model, calculations of the transition probabilities, and determination of the neighborhood rules were defined by the remote sensing and GIS datasets 
In Sichuan province, many earth observation data have been used for land management, monitoring, and degradation studies 
In connection with this, future land use and land cover change (FLULCC) and future potential landscape risk (FPLR) patterns for the years 2025, 2030, and 2040 were observed based on the cellular automata-Markov chain (CA-Markov) modeling and multicriteria-based analytical hierarchy process (MC-AHP) approach. LULCC modeling and FPLR assessment was carried out by integrating remote sensing and GIS techniques developed for the first time in the DCEN area. However, this study considers it a unique approach to model the DCEN area closely, focusing on FLULCC along with the FPLR scenarios up to 2040.
Comparison and analysis of LULC in the distant past and in recent times is important in order to understand the changes in spatiotemporal LULC 
The present study focuses on quantitative analysis of spatiotemporal changes of future LULC changes in 2025, 2030, and 2040 based on the 2018 LULC simulation and further considers recent LR 2018 data with ancillary layers to identify FPLR areas across the DCEN. In this study, examples are shared for each future LULC map preparation, referring to 2018 as the earlier example and 2025 as the recent one, and so on. However, the broad objectives of this study were to examine three issues: (1) quantitatively evaluating FLULC changes in the DCEN in considering 2018 simulation data, (2) quantitatively evaluating future LULCC in different time domain matrices' data such as comparing earlier LULC datasets with the recent one  | Materials and Methods:  | Study Area: DCEN is a county-level city located in the Sichuan province of China, which covers an area of 318.30 km 2 . The city, which suffered a deadly earthquake in 2008, is now a UNESCO world heritage site and underwent massive renovations in 2013. It shares a border with southern Nagawa Tibet in the north, due to which it receives many tourists. The geography of the study site is mountainous with many forests, rivers, bridges, and urban infrastructures  | Data: The remote sensing data used in this study were based on the Landsat 5 thematic mapper (TM) and Landsat 8 operation land imager (OLI). The spectral resolution and bands of the data were used in this study (Table  | Data: The remote sensing data used in this study were based on the Landsat 5 thematic mapper (TM) and Landsat 8 operation land imager (OLI). The spectral resolution and bands of the data were used in this study (Table 
In addition, a shuttle radar topographic mission (SRTM) with 30m resolution was used for the digital elevation model (DEM) (Figure

The image covers less than 5% cloud in original satellite images, 2% in 2007, 4.65% and 2018 (4.65%). Due to the presence of cloud cover in the epicentral area, we only considered the area near the 2008 earthquake epicenter (8.0 Mw). The area of interest (AOI) is demarcated in the satellite images with the help of the polygon feature using the ArcGIS 10.6 software (ESRI, Redlands, USA) environment. The two Landsat images were geometrically corrected and projected to a WGS 84 (World Geodetic System 1984) into a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 48N coordinate system. Detailed preprocessing of the Landsat 5 TM and 8 OLI images was carried out by Nath et al. 
In addition, a shuttle radar topographic mission (SRTM) with 30m resolution was used for the digital elevation model (DEM) (Figure  | Methodology: The integrated research methodological workflow requires four main steps (Figure 
Step 2: Creation of FLULC maps based on the CA-Markov model first, then transition matrix table creation based on different time periods with dynamic degree estimation, including overall change.
Step 3: PCA image creation based on the Landsat 8 OLI image and the lineament-based lineament density (LD) map adopted from Nath et al.  | Methodology: The integrated research methodological workflow requires four main steps (Figure  | LULCC Modeling Using Land Change Modeler: In the present study, we used the Clark Lab's land change modeler (LCM) of TerrSet 18.21 version software to develop FLULC maps based on the preprocessed classified historical satellite images of 2007 and 2018 (adopted from Nath et al. 
In order to run the future predictions, the integrated CA-Markov approach 
In addition, the model further needed to be validated first before running the simulation. Since the actual LULC image of 2018 was already available, adopted from Nath et al. 2018  | LULCC Modeling Using Land Change Modeler: In the present study, we used the Clark Lab's land change modeler (LCM) of TerrSet 18.21 version software to develop FLULC maps based on the preprocessed classified historical satellite images of 2007 and 2018 (adopted from Nath et al.

In addition, the model further needed to be validated first before running the simulation. Since the actual LULC image of 2018 was already available, adopted from Nath et al. 2018  | FLULC Dynamic Degree Estimation and Transition Matrices Computation Method: To estimate the dynamic degree (DD) changes between the various types of FLULC, i.e., to know whether there has been any loss in the area or gain in certain LULC types when comparing images for different periods, for a single FLULC type, we used the DD model to represent the spatiotemporal characteristics of FLULC change. The dynamic estimation can be calculated using the approach of Liu et al. 
where D represents the DD model, which refers to rate of change; A a is the area in the initial year; A b is the area in the terminal year; and T is the temporal scale. In our case, the time comparisons are 7, 5, 10, and 22 years, respectively. The DD model finally serves to generate statistical data in a table with DD (%) and Gain and Loss (%). Furthermore, transition matrix (TM) tables of 2018-2025, 2025-2030, 2030-2040, and 2018-2040 were computed based on the simulated LULC data of 2018, which were generated from the original 2007 and 2018 image results. Therefore, based on the 2018 simulated LULC results, similar statistical results for the different time periods of 2018-2025, 2025-2030, 2030-2040, and 2018-2040 are prepared in this study. These data (vector format) were analyzed and conversion was carried out using ArcGIS 10.6 software, which allows the identification of the areas where changes will occur, and those LULC were not altered in the FLULC. Furthermore, all of the results obtained using GIS software were exported to a text file and the databases were later used for statistical analysis. | FPLR Evaluation Method: In this study, the LR evaluation methodological concept adopted from Nath et al. 
Recently, the multicriteria evaluation (MCE) method has been used to assess and aggregate weighted maps (criterion) based on expert knowledge of factor influence and interactions with LULC 
Multiple parameters, such as the future LULC maps of 2025, 2030, and 2040, the 2018 lineament feature, the 2018 LD map, fault lines, and the epicenter, overlaid along with the local geology map, slope, aspect, and DEM, are used as reference datasets in integrated mapping. Moreover, the geology map was adopted from Nath et al. 
Details of the meaning and individual weighted assigned score of each layer are given in Supplementary Table 
In this stage, for better visualization purposes, a further classification procedure of the natural breaks (Jenks) method with a five-class range (graduated color ramp applied with the blue to red intensification) was implied for each FPLR map. Finally, the prepared FPLR maps of 2025, 2030, and 2040 were masked based on the study area boundary. The entire mapping phases were performed in the multiple software domain, such as Clark Lab's LCM of TerrSet 18.21, ArcGIS 10.6 including the previously adopted ENVI 5.3, PCI Geomatica 2018, and RockWorks 16 version software, considered for earlier map preparation. | Results:  | Validation of Future LULCC Prediction: The actual land use of 2018 was compared with the simulated 2018 land use based on the CA-Markov model.

The FLULC change will occurr in RA with a high negative DD change of -12.69% yr -1 in 2018-2025, and in the next two time periods of 2025-2030 and 2030-2040, positive changes in DD will be observed-4.78% and 0.53% yr -1 , respectively. Overall, in the 2018-2040 time period, this trend will negatively impact RA and DD, leading to a change of -3.88% yr -1 (R 2 = 0.922) in DCEN, which is clearly evident in different time intervals. From 2007 to 2018, it showed a -4.67% yr -1 decrease, whereas in the 2018-2025 and 2025-2030 periods, it decreased -12.69% yr -1 and increased 4.78% yr -1 , respectively. By contrast, BL is projected to increase 1.32% yr -1 in 2018-2025 (Table 
However, the modeling results show different scenarios with regard to projected changes in LULC in future. The projected BU result shows the coverage area will be 15.39% in 2040 and 16.04% in 2025, both of which are lower than 2018, 18.49%. Overall, the BU data suggest a decline of -3.10% in 2018-2040 (Table 
Based on the polynomial regression data fitted to a polynomial equation in three simulated time periods and the overall scenario, the regression equation and R 2 values show each trend line. During the period 2018-2025, the R 2 value is 0.234, whereas R 2 = 0.358 and R 2 = 0.298 for the periods 2025-2030, and 2030-2040, respectively. However, during the overall 2018-2040 periods, the R 2 value is 0.251.

The FLULC data for the period 2018-2025 show that the BU class has a probability of 1.12% and 1.11% to change into WB and BL, respectively (Table  | FPLR Area Identification, Mapping and Pattern of Change Analysis: In the final level analysis, this study further utilized MC-AHP approach to evaluate the FPLR zone for the periods 2025, 2030, and 2040.

This change is obvious and always has a tendency to put pressure on AG, which likely to lead to an increase in the urban and rural population in the DCEN area. | FPLR Area Identification, Mapping and Pattern of Change Analysis: In the final level analysis, this study further utilized MC-AHP approach to evaluate the FPLR zone for the periods 2025, 2030, and 2040. In a recent study, Nath et al. 
In comparison to 2018, the FPLR areas of the very high risk category will grow approximately 2.5 times in 2025-2040. The rest of the areas will be very low to low risk categories in future (Table 9a-c) and (Figure  | Discussion: In this section, we would like to address a few issues that have been observed during FLULC change model predictions in the changing landscape of the DCEN. Firstly, the predicted and observed data are not perfectly matched; therefore, a higher-level accuracy is not achieved. Generally, a higher level of accuracy is expected when the model is run through the LCM module of TerrSet 18.21 version software. We also detected FLULC scenarios, and its trends of change in the percentage and rate of change were observed per year based on different predicted time periods from 2018 to 2040. In connection with this study, the two LULC maps 
Furthermore, the FLULC images were used to generate future potential landscape matrix (FPLM) tables based on the different time periods of 2018-2025, 2025-2030, 2030-2040, and overall 2018-2040. The model and observed data provide over 70% accuracy, which represents a substantial agreement (Section 3.1) of the model validation and its utilizations. Based on the FLULC image output, we produced FLULCC matrix tables of different time periods that show the LULCC transformation from one category to another, as well as its unchanged categories.
In developing and developed countries, the LULC changes and predictive approaches using the CA-Markov model were used across the globe in recent times. However, those studies solely represented the particular LULC changes identified in the selective regions. However, those studies were not focused on the FPLR approaches which were given much less attention and documented less in the past. In recent times, the DCEN area showed changes in LULC for the first time prior to and after the earthquake of 2008 as well as its present status, including the integrated approach to assess the LR pattern 
This study first developed and analyzed FLULC mapping and identified the different FLULCC in different time periods, 2018-2025, 2025-2030, 2030-2040, and overall 2018-2040 in the DCEN area of SW China. Here, FLULC gain/loss (%) as well as rate of change per year in the corresponding time frame were computed. Our projected results showed that the BU class has a probability of 1.12% and 1.11% to change into WB and BL, respectively (see Table 
However, in 2018-2040, the BU data suggest decreasing conditions (-3.10%) of -0.14% yr -1 , which will further decerase (-0.47%) at a rate of -0.09% yr -1 during the periods 2025-2030 and -0.18% with a -0.02% yr -1 in the period 2030-2040. The results of the earlier studies 
In addition, this study finally prepared and analyzed FPLR maps for the years 2025, 2030, and 2040 (Figure 
Therefore, this study further identified the risk according to geological zones in three projected years, 2025, 2030, and 2040. The geological zones II, I, and IV were identified as in the very high risk category (Table 
In this study, the FLULCC modeling results and FPLR areas and probable priority-based risk assessment raised a question on the environmental sustainability of the DCEN area in the coming decades. Thus, a priority-based sustainable solution would be further recommended, as well as checking the unsustainable LULC movements in the study areas. Therefore, by observing the FPLR pattern, it is high time to properly inspect and discuss with the locals what to do and what their concerns are regarding the future landscape change and FPLR, which will be incorporated in the future planning of this area to make the DCEN area sustainable. Moreover, the remote sensing and GIS integrated techniques help to build a model and validate it and are found to be ideal for plausible future LULCC prediction which may further help to identify future probable risk areas at spatiotemporal scale. | Conclusions: The present study utilized geospatial data of the two past LULC maps of 2007 and 2018, LR map of 2018, and other associated derived map products used in an integrated manner to develop FLULC maps, future changing trends, and generate FPLR maps of the DCEN. As the DCEN area was previously affected by a high-intensity earthquake (8.0) and its landscape was severely affected afterwards 
From CA-Markov modeling, changes in LULC will occur in the future in the DCEN area which may be very devastating if the area is affected by high-intensity earthquakes. Therefore, all developmental planning should be focused on finding a nature-based solution that ensures there is less risk and works in conjunction with sustainability goals, with a further suggestion to stop and check developmental activities in the fault and close adjoining areas, and if possible resettle urban dwellers elsewhere, far from the fault lines. The detailed analysis in the present study will be of great use for baseline information to assist city planners, local administrations, and earthquake engineers for future planning and development and technical-know-how about upcoming landscape changes and FLR of DCEN.
An earlier study 
Finally, we found that the multitemporal Landsat images of 2007 and 2018 are very useful to generate a LULC simulation image of 2018, followed by a FLULC image for the years 2025, 2030, and 2040 of DCEN using the LCM of TerrSet software. To understand the FLULC, its trends, and future gain and loss estimation of DCEN in the future, we further calculated the matrix of the FLULC in different time domains. However, based on the integrated layers, including the FLULC of 2025, 2030, and 2040, the LD of 2018 (which will change with time) and other ancillary data were recoded with risk priority with the weighted sum method, applied to prepare FPLR maps of DCEN in a consecutive manner for the years 2025, 2030, and 2040. As we observed, DCEN was identified as a risk-prone area in an earlier study 
The findings of this study might serve as an example for any earthquake-prone city around the world, including the BRC, which will help to exclusively monitor future Silk Road disaster activities. The present study provides future projections about LULC change in the DCEN area, which may be checked in advance for further landscape damage. Geospatial (such as Remote sensing and GIS) integrated software techniques were also found to be ideal, helping to know the FLULC changing status, including in the FPLR areas. Moreover, the present study proved that the integrated techniques have the ability to know FPLR areas and the probable pattern of change in the BRC. Thus, to minimize the FPLR factors of DCEN, it is high time to exchange the results of the FLULC status and its probable change direction, including the FPLR pattern with academics, city planners, national policy makers, and locals to make the DCEN area of the BRC safe, sound, and disaster-proof. Detailed analysis shows a useful future prediction of Silk-Road disaster, which may further help towards achieving the UN 2030 sustainable goals. | Supplementary Materials:: The following are available online at http://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/9/2/134/s1, Table ","Environmental Information Coalition (, , , 2010) || Definition of Transition.

"Assessing the Effect of Land-Use and Land-Cover Changes on Discharge and Sediment Yield in a Rural Coal-Mine Dominated Watershed in Kentucky, USA",Buddhi Gyawali; Sandesh Shrestha; Aman Bhatta; Bijay Pokhr; Richard Cristan; George Antonious; Swagata Banerjee; Krishna Paudel,"The Appalachian Mountain region of eastern Kentucky is unique and contains high proportions of forestland along with coal and natural gas depositaries. Landscape changes due to extreme mining activities can eventually threaten the downstream ecosystems, including soil and water quality, resulting in excessive runoff and sedimentation. The purpose of this study is to assess the impacts of land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes in streamflow and sediment yield in Yellow Creek Watershed, Kentucky, USA, between 1992 and 2016. LULC, digital elevation model, soil, and weather data were inputted into the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate discharge and sediment yield. The model output was evaluated on several statistical parameters, such as the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR), percent bias (PBIAS), and the coefficient of determination (R 2 ). In addition, two indices, P-factor and R-factor, were used to measure the prediction uncertainty. The calibrated model showed an increase in surface runoff and sediment yield due to changes in LULC in the Yellow Creek Watershed. The results provided important insights for studying water management strategies to make more informed land management decisions and adaptive practices.","Introduction: Land-use and land-cover (hereafter LULC) change is a phenomenon that has been taking place since the beginning of humankind. It has long been considered a factor affecting the global environment 
Various anthropogenic activities have played an important role in landscape changes in the Appalachian Mountains region. Surface mining has been one of the major activities since World War II, resulting in a significant alteration in the mountain landscapes with the transformation of native forests and their associated soils into heavily disturbed mine lands 
It has become necessary to study the temporal and spatial variations in hydrological balance and to understand the mechanisms of influence behind LULC change impacts. However, it is impossible to measure every component of the hydrological system due mainly to watershed heterogeneity and inadequate measuring tools 
In the United States, SWAT is increasingly being used to study in-stream processes 
Considering the void that exists in the literature, this study provides a case study from the Yellow Creek Watershed, a small critical watershed in eastern Kentucky that has been heavily impacted by coal-mining activities but supports local livelihoods and the ecosystem within and around the Appalachian Mountains region. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of LULC changes on streamflow and sediment yield between 1992 and 2016. The Yellow Creek Watershed is particularly of interest to this study due to past and ongoing surface mining and reclamation activities as a major LULC change in the region (See Figure  | Materials and Methods:  | Description of the Study Region: The Yellow Creek Watershed falls within the Upper Cumberland River basin. The watershed is primarily located in Bell County, Kentucky, but extends into Claiborne County, Tennessee. The outlet of this watershed corresponds to the point where a monitoring station (USGS 03402000) is installed, which is at Yellow Creek near Middlesboro (latitude: 36 ‚Ä¢ 40 05 , longitude: 83 ‚Ä¢ 41 19 ) (Figure  | The SWAT Model: The SWAT model is a physically based, watershed-scale simulation model jointly developed by the USDA Agricultural Research Service and Texas A&M AgriLife Research, part of the Texas A&M University System 
where SW t is the final soil water content on day i, SW 0 is the initial soil water content on day i, t is the time in days, R day is the amount of rainfall on day i, Q surf is the amount of surface runoff on day i, E a is the amount of evapotranspiration on day i, W seep is the amount of water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile on day i, and Q gw is the amount of base flow or return flow on day i.
The surface runoff was estimated by using the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Soil Conservation Services (SCS) runoff curve number (CN) approach 
where Q surf is the accumulated runoff or rainfall access, R day is the rainfall depth of the day (mm H 2 O), I a is the initial abstractions, which includes surface storage, interception and infiltration prior to runoff (mm H 2 O), and S is the retention parameter (mm H 2 O). The retention parameter (S) is dependent spatially to changes in soils, land use, management, and slope, and temporarily to changes in soil water content 
where CN is the curve number for the day. The initial abstraction, I a , is usually approximated as 0.2S, so equation 2 can be rewritten as
The SWAT offers three methods to estimate potential evapotranspiration (PET): the Penman-Monteith method, the Priestley-Taylor method, and the Hargreaves method 
where ŒªE is the latent heat flux density (MJ m -2 d -1 ), E is the depth rate evaporation (mm d -1 ), ‚àÜ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure-temperature curve, de/dT (kPa ‚Ä¢ C -1 ), H net is the net radiation (MJ m -2 d -1 ), G is the heat flux density to the ground (MJ m -2 d -1 ), œÅ air is the air density (kg m -3 ), c p is the specific heat at constant pressure (MJ kg -1 ‚Ä¢ C -1 ), e 0 z is the saturation vapor pressure of air at height z (kPa), e z is the water vapor pressure of air at height z (kPa), Œ≥ is the psychometric constant (kPa ‚Ä¢ C -1 ), r c is the plant canopy resistance (s m -1 ), and r a is the diffusion resistance of the air layer (aerodynamic resistance) (s m -1 ) 
The sediment component for each HRU was calculated using the modified universal soil loss equation (MUSLE). The MUSLE [51] is

LOADEST uses three statistical estimation methods for the calibration  | SWAT Model Setup: ArcSWAT 2012, an ArcGIS extension and interface for SWAT, was used to simulate the SWAT model. ArcSWAT interface is a public domain software, and as such may be used freely 
A threshold critical source area of 350 ha (between the suggested range by ArcGIS watershed delineation interface) was used for this study, which divided the watershed into 21 sub-basins (Figure  | SWAT-CUP Premium and SWAT Parameter Estimator (SPE) Algorithm: We used SWAT-CUP Premium (SWAT-CUPP), a computer program developed for calibration of the SWAT model (https://www.2w2e.com/home/SwatCupPremium; accessed on 17 February 2021). SWAT-CUPP is an improved version of SWAT-CUP, which allows for behavioral and multi-objective calibration 
SWAT-CUPP offers two algorithms, SWAT Parameter Estimator (SPE) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We used the SPE algorithm (previously Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2)) for model sensitivity analysis, calibration, uncertainty analysis, and validation 
where Y obs i is the ith observation for the constituent being evaluated, Y sim i is the ith simulated value for the constituent being evaluated, Y mean i is the mean of observed data for the constituent being evaluated, and n is the total number of observations  | Model Sensitivity Analysis: Sensitivity analysis is the foremost step in the calibration and validation process in SWAT-CUPP, which determines the most sensitive parameters for a given watershed 
One-at-a-time sensitivity analysis was conducted for each parameter while keeping other parameter values constant 
where g denotes the objective function, b is the parameter, Œ± is the regression constant, Œ≤ corresponds to the technical coefficient attached to the variable b, and m is the number of parameters 
In addition, statistical measurements t-stat and p-value were used to identify the sensitive parameters, with larger t-stats and smaller p-values representing greater sensitivity. Based on one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis, Abbaspour et al. 
The results of global sensitivity analysis after the first iteration are listed in Table  | Model Calibration and Uncertainty Analysis: The second step is model calibration, in which parameter value ranges are adjusted to improve the fit between model predictions and real-world observations 
Calibration is characteristically subjective and, therefore, closely linked to model output uncertainty 
where k is the number of observed data points, l is a counter and X L (2.5th) and X U (97.5th) represent the lower and upper boundaries of the 95PPU 
where œÉ X is the standard deviation of the measured variable X. The P-factor value of >0.7 (at least 70%) and R-factor value of <1.5 (at most 150%) are desirable and recommended to be adequate  | Model Validation: After calibration, the model is validated with the calibrated parameter ranges and by comparing predictions to additional observed data, which is not used for calibration. Based on the level of agreement between predictions and the additional observations, the model is validated for further use, or model inputs and parameters are revisited for further calibration 
The initial model obtained from ArcSWAT was divided into two periods, 1990-1997 for calibration and 1998-2004 for validation in SWAT-CUPP. Discharge was calibrated first since it is the primary controlling variable 
Parallel processing was utilized to speed up the calibration process. The parallel processing module utilized all eight CPUs where, for each iteration, 600 simulations were divided into eight simultaneous runs of 75 each per CPU. This substantially improved the runtime of the calibration and validation process  | Model Performance Indices: In addition to two indices used for prediction uncertainty analysis, P-factor and R-factor, multiple indices are made available to check the performance of the SWAT model  | Results:  | Model Calibration, Uncertainty Analysis, and Validation: After performing three iterations (600 simulations in each) with modifications to the parameters, the model was observed to have a good fit between the observed and simulated discharge and between the LOADEST-simulated and SWAT-simulated sediment. The statistical results of the model performance for discharge and sediment during both calibration and validation periods are summarized in Table  | Impact of LULC Change on the Water Balance Components in Yellow Creek Watershed: The annual summaries of water balance components between 1992 and 2016 are listed in Table  | Sediment Yield and LULC Change in Yellow Creek Watershed: The spatial distribution of sediment yield in 1992 and 2016 within the Yellow Creek Watershed is illustrated in Figure 
As illustrated in Table 
Figure  | Discussion: The resulting statistics of our study were acceptable based on the guidelines 
The results from this study imply that LULC modification might have a significant impact on the annual water balance in the watershed. The decline in percolation, lateral flow, and groundwater might be mainly due to changes in LULC and altered soil properties due to coal-mining activities in the watershed. Similarly, increased runoff indicated the lower infiltration capacity of the surface. Evidence from previous studies also suggests the historical LULC change impact in basin-scale water balance, such as with the Raccoon River Watershed in Iowa 
Our findings are consistent with previous studies that suggest increasing sediment yields, water quality degradation, and increasing flood events pertaining to LULC changes 
Several studies show higher peak and total storm runoff from mined lands compared to forested lands in the Appalachian region 
SWAT is an effective and widely accepted tool in predicting the impact of LULC changes  | Conclusions: This study was successful in simulating sediment yield and quantifying the impact of LULC change on the hydrology of the watershed. The results showed a very good agreement between observed and predicted discharge and sediment at the outlet. The results showed that the Yellow Creek Watershed experienced LULC changes over 25 years between 1992 and 2016. It consisted primarily of a decrease in forest cover which mostly converted into coal-mine lands, urban development, and growth in pastureland. Similarly, the comparison of the distribution of water balance components, sediment yield, and LULC changes in the watershed implied that LULC changes, specifically ongoing surface mining activities, increasing pastureland, and urban development, have contributed to augmenting the sediment yield in the watershed.
This study contributes to studying land management practices in watersheds impaired by coal-mine operations. Addressing impacts of LULC change issues strategically and timely is essential for the effective management of coal-mine lands and water resources. Identifying critical areas and selecting best management practices (BMPs) in watershed scale are necessary for reducing sedimentation. The BMPs in watershed scale, for example, should focus on approaches for reducing the environmental footprints of mining by implementing reclamation practices that are feasible in the watershed.
Despite model and data limitations, this study fills the gap that exists in modeling LULC impacts on water and land management in the coal-mine lands of the Appalachian region in Kentucky. The findings presented provide a plethora of information on LULC changes and their impact on hydrology. The maps and tables produced in this study provide essential spatial information on the sub-basin scale to researchers in identifying and implementing appropriate land management practices.
There is a dearth of systematic research and data to quantify the effects of coal-mine lands on increased surface runoff and sediment yield. This research is a case study modeling impacts of LULC on runoff and sediment yield. We recommend continuing similar studies in the other watersheds to discern the role of change in LULC on runoff and sediment yield using high-resolution land cover data and integrating such data with human populations and infrastructure changes such as access roads to coal mine areas. Future studies should include local rainfall characteristics and evapotranspiration data. Rainfall patterns and their impacts on coal-field areas will be important to study in this region.
In future studies, this approach can further be utilized in other similar watersheds to explore the impacts of surface-mining activities on the hydrological properties and to evaluate the effectiveness of best management practices (BMPs) in managing sediment yields for environmental stewardship at the watershed level.

Impacts of land use and land cover change in response to different driving forces in Uganda: evidence from a review,Justine Luwa; Yazidhi Bamutaze; Jackson-Gilbert Majaliwa Mwanjalolo; Daniel Waiswa; Petter Pilesj√∂; Espoir Mukengere,"This reviewe of Land Use Land Cover Change (LULCC) studies in Uganda indicate agriculture, forest, grassland, and woodland as the major land use and land cover types. Central Uganda is the most studied region (15%), followed by western ( ","Introduction: Land use and land cover change (LULCC) can result from both intentional and non-intentional human activities or as a result of natural causes. However, human forces are now known to be altering the natural global landscape at unprecedented magnitudes and at different spatial-temporal scales 
Many studies on LULCC change have been conducted in Uganda at different spatial and temporal scales for different reasons. For example, 
Uganda is geared to attain a middle income economy by 2040 in the background of a young and rapidly growing population (growth rate of above 3.03% per annum). The total population was 34 million in 2014 and is projected to reach 80 million by 2040  | Country profile and framework of the review:  | Country profile: Uganda is a landlocked country in East Africa located in Southeast Africa between 1¬∞ N and 4¬∞ N latitude and 30¬∞ E and 35¬∞ E longitude. The country has a total surface area of about 241,500 km 2 of which land occupies 194,000 km 2 and the rest is open water and wetlands (UBOS, 2014). Uganda has equatorial type of climate with mean annual temperatures ranging from 16¬∞ C to 30¬∞ C (UBOS, 2014). Two rainy seasons are experienced in the central, western, and eastern regions from March to May and September to November. The northern region receives one long rainy season (April-October) in a year. Average annual amount of rainfall received in most parts of the country ranges between 750 mm and 2,100 mm (UBOS, 2014). Uganda's vegetation varies, with the south having tropical rain forest and savannah, while woodlands and semiarid vegetation dominate the other parts of the country. Uganda has one of the highest population growth rates (>3%) in the world and over 80% of its 34,6 million people (Table  | Framework within which the review was conducted: The current study focuses on review of LULCC studies within Uganda and it was restricted to only electronically available literature. The review was conducted within the framework of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach (Figure  | Results and discussion:  | The study locations in Uganda: The review revealed that central Uganda is the most studied region with (15) of the case studies, followed by western region (14), eastern region (10), while northern region registered (3) case studies see (Figure  | Major land use and land cover types: Generally, ten major land use and land cover types were addressed in the case studies. Of the different land use and land cover types, agriculture, forest, grassland, and woodland were the most commonly reported (Figure

29  | Publication trend: In research, the number and growth rate of scientific publications are taken as important science productivity or output indicators 
Statistically, each author is producing 1.2 publication every twenty years equivalent to 0.6 publication per decade. The mean of publication over the two decades is 3 while the median is also 3 with a variance of 4.6 document published and standard deviation of 2.1. The growth in number of publication fits an exponential curve with R 2 = 0.42. The pattern of growth of literature on LULCC in Uganda agrees with the scientifically documented pattern in studies of literature production over a long period of time  | Intensity of the studies: The intensity of the studies (Figure  | Time frame of case studies: It is noted from Figure  | Scales of the studies: Uganda is divided into administrative units: the first is national, second is regional, third is district, forth is county, fifth is subcounty, sixth is parish, seventh is village. In addition to the administrative  
On the other hand, all catchment scale studies have directly or indirectly focused on impacts of LULCC on water resources. For example, 
The reasons for the national scale studies have been to: understand the spatial and temporal land use and carbon stock changes in Uganda  | Methods/data employed: The review has indicated that the most used method/data was earth observation, particularly Landsat imagery (30 m resolution) employed in 95.2% of cases and then MODIS (250 m and 500 m) employed in 2.4% of cases, and transect walk plus interview in 2.4% of studies (Figure  | Land use and land cover change statistics in Uganda: The review points that generally, agriculture and built up areas (from here on used interchangeably with settlements) have increased while forest and woodland have decreased over the period 
The numbers of urban centers increased from 67 in 1991 to 259 in 2014, while urban population increased from 0.6 million people in 1969 to 6.4 million people in 2014 (UBOS, 2014). The implication is that the interaction of population growth and other drivers of LULC change is favoring agriculture and built-up/urban areas expansion at the expense of forest, woodlands, wetlands, as later discussed in Section. On local scales, 
Note that the trends of forest cover and agriculture in northern Uganda are different from the national trend and those in other regions. First, only 9.5% of the reviewed LULCC studies were from northern Uganda. Fewer studies meant less representation of the actual situation on the ground. Northern Uganda also experienced armed conflict from 1986 to mid-2000s. During the period of the armed conflict, people were restricted to live in Internally Displaced Person's camp (IDP's). The people had little or no access to their land, and could therefore not exploit the resources therein. With return of peace in northern Uganda, IDP's life ended in the late 2008. There are now good roads linking all parts of the region to the grater markets within Uganda, and with South Sudan and DR. Congo. There has also been rapid expansion of commercial farming (by the so-called 'investors') in the northern districts of Nwoya and Amuru in the last ten years. The dynamics and the trajectory of LULCC in northern Uganda have thus changed. It is not surprising that the study of  | Reported major drivers of land use and land cover change: Only 38% of the studies analyzed the drivers of LULCC. However, even articles that did not analyze LULCC drivers have alluded to some or all the drivers in (Figure  | Interactions between drivers of LULCC: The review indicates that the major drivers of LULCC do not operate in isolation but rather combined. For example, the population of Uganda grew from 6.8 million people in 1960 to  
In Uganda, agriculture is a key sector to the livelihoods of the rural population (79% of total population) and to the economy of Uganda (UBOS, 2018). Accordingly, in the year 2013/14 and 2015/16, agriculture employed 74.7% and 73% of total rural labor force respectively and the sector's contribution to total GDP increased from 23.7% in 2015/16 to 25% in 2016/17 
As already discussed, the population of Uganda is projected to more than double by 2040. In simple term and based on analysis of drivers of LULCC, this can be translated as more pressure on the fixed land resources by 2040. The demographic trend and desire for socioeconomic growth in Uganda may continue to drive LULCC in the country. Similarly,  | Impacts of land use and land cover change: LULCC is having a wide range of impacts on the environment and the people of Uganda at different spatial and temporal scales. For example,  | Summary of findings: The review has indicated that that LULCC studies in Uganda have only been conducted for 20 years 1998-2018. The studies mostly used Landsat 30 m data and covered different spatial and temporal scales. Generally, agriculture and built up areas are increasing at the expense of forest, wetland and woodland. Although, the major drivers of LULCC interact with one another, population pressure stands out of all the key drivers of LULCC at both national and local scales. The magnitudes and impacts of LULCC differs in both space and time within Uganda. The historical to current trend of LULCC change and related impacts are likely to significantly increase in (2040); as the projected population is likely to double by 2040 in Uganda. | Limitations: Our study mainly focused on electronically published articles available in Web of Science and Google scholar. Hard copies of documents in university libraries and ministerial achieves were not considered. This could have increased the number of materials selected and analyzed. However, most probably this would only have a positive impact on the sampling space, but not affecting the findings. | Disclosure statement: No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.","Land use/cover change and perceived watershed status in Eastern Uganda (, , , , 2016) || Growth of literature on Bradford's law.

"Vegetation Trends, Drought Severity and Land Use-Land Cover Change during the Growing Season in Semi-Arid Contexts",Felicia Akinyemi,"Drought severity and impact assessments are necessary to effectively monitor droughts in semi-arid contexts. However, little is known about the influence land use-land cover (LULC) has-in terms of the differences in annual sizes and configurations-on drought effects. Coupling remote sensing and Geographic Information System techniques, drought evolution was assessed and mapped. During the growing season, drought severity and the effects on LULC were examined and whether these differed between areas of land change and persistence. This study used areas of economic importance to Botswana as case studies. Vegetation Condition Index, derived from Normalised Difference Vegetation Index time series for the growing seasons (2000-2018 in  comparison to 2020-2021), was used to assess droughts for 17 constituencies (Botswana's fourth administrative level) in the Central District of Botswana. Further analyses by LULC types and land change highlighted the vulnerability of both human and natural systems to drought. Identified drought periods in the time series correspond to declared drought years by the Botswana government. Drought severity (extreme, severe, moderate and mild) and the percentage of land areas affected varied in both space and time. The growing seasons of 2002-2003, 2003-2004 and 2015-2016  were the most drought-stricken in the entire time series, coinciding with the El Ni√±o southern oscillation (ENSO). The lower-than-normal vegetation productivity during these growing seasons was evident from the analysis. With the above-normal vegetation productivity in the ongoing season (2020-2021), the results suggest the reversal of the negative vegetation trends observed in the preceding growing seasons. However, the extent of this reversal cannot be confidently ascertained with the season still ongoing. Relating drought severity and intensities to LULC and change in selected drought years revealed that most lands affected by extreme and severe drought (in descending order) were in tree-covered areas (forests and woodlands), grassland/rangelands and croplands. These LULC types were the most affected as extreme drought intersected vegetation productivity decline. The most impacted constituencies according to drought severity and the number of drought events were Mahalapye west (eight), Mahalapye east (seven) and Boteti west (seven). Other constituencies experienced between six and two drought events of varying durations throughout the time series. Since not all constituencies were affected similarly during declared droughts, studies such as this contribute to devising appropriate context-specific responses aimed at minimising drought impacts on social-ecological systems. The methodology utilised can apply to other drylands where climatic and socioeconomic contexts are similar to those of Botswana.","Introduction: Drought as a slow-onset event is increasingly an environmental hazard due to its negative impacts on natural and human systems, including livelihoods  | Materials and Methods:  | Description of the Study Location: Seventeen constituencies in the Central District of Botswana (CDB) in the eastern part of the country were used as case studies (Figure

The district is of great economic importance to Botswana, with 23% (31,634 holdings) of all traditional agricultural holdings in Botswana  | Data Sources: Variability in vegetation condition and drought severity in the CDB were examined over 18 years using the 1 km Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) decadal (i.e., 10-day composite) image time series from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (https://land.copernicus.eu/global/products/ndvi, accessed on 8 January 2021). These images were made available through the European Union-African Union-funded project on Monitoring for environment and security in Africa (MESA). The MESA was implemented for the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region comprising 15 countries and included Madagascar and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The dekadal NDVI datasets from October 2000 to 2014 were derived from SPOT VGT, and data from June 2014 to 2018 are from the PROBA-V 
The land cover datasets were from the European Space Agency (ESA-LC) Climate Change Initiative (CCI-LC v.2.0.7) ESA CCI and Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S-LC Mv52 https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-land-cover?tab= form, accessed on 8 January 2021). These datasets are a consistent series of multi-sensor annual maps from 1992 to 2018  | Methods:  | Indicators of Vegetation Variability: Indices used for measuring vegetation variability and drought severity are based on the NDVI. NDVI is widely utilised for assessing and monitoring vegetation greenness, net primary productivity, plant phenology and land degradation in natural and human systems 
Three indicators of vegetation variability utilised in this study were derived from NDVI-NDVI difference, NDVI anomaly and NDVI trends. Other derived metrics to gauge seasonal vegetation productivity include the NDVI mean, maximum and cumulative values computed for each month in the growing season within the time series. | NDVI Difference: To analyse the variability of vegetation during the vegetation growing season over the 18-year study period, the NDVI Difference (NDVI diff ) function implemented in the MESA Drought Monitoring Services (DMS) software was utilised. NDVI diff is widely used to get an indication of vegetation state over a specific period by comparing vegetation productivity between two dekads or relative to the long-term average for the same period. This indicator highlights areas where vegetation is under stress as well as those performing well. For this study, seasonal NDVI diff was calculated for every growing season (i.e., annually) as the difference between the start dekad (i.e., first 10-day period) in October (D1) in a certain year i to the end dekad (i.e., last 10-day period) in March (D3) of the following year i + 1 in the time series data of 2000 to 2018 (Equation (2)):
Standardised NDVI Anomalies NDVI anomaly captures how vegetation productivity for a certain period deviates from the long-term average dynamics. It is calculated by subtracting the considered month NDVI from the month's long-term average and dividing it by the monthly standard deviation for that period. By distinguishing areas that are normal from those that are above or below normal vegetation productivity, NDVI anomaly is helpful to identify outliers, isolate the variability in the vegetation signal and consider the reviewed period within a meaningful historical context  | NDVI Trend: Using the NDVI time series of 2000 to 2020 as input, we computed vegetation change as trends and their significance based on the Mann-Kendall (MK) non-parametric test. Non-parametric approaches estimate trends in a time series by quantifying the rate of change in vegetation greenness for each pixel and characterises trends in the data using the median slope  | Drought Indicators Vegetation Condition Index: Drought severity during the growing season was measured using the NDVI-based Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) as in Equation (3) 
VCI is particularly useful for agriculture, as it assesses changes in NDVI through time since vegetation is water-stressed due to water deficiency such as during drought. VCI for the vegetation growing season was calculated between 2000-2001 and 2017-2018 starting with the first dekad of October in the previous year to the third dekad in March of the following year. VCI is measured as a percentage with values ranging between 0 (lowest) and 100 (highest), with values equal to or below 40% considered as drought to varying degrees of severity (Table  | Drought Intensity: Drought intensities for each growing season were calculated through the 18-year study period. These are percentages of pixels (a proxy for the surface land area) whose VCI values fell within the different drought severity and non-drought categories  | Drought Frequency: To relate the pixel-level VCI to each of the 17 constituencies in the CDB, the zonal statistics function in GIS was used. The median VCI value within each constituency was utilised because there is the tendency for more years in drylands to have rainfall below the mean, with the median value deviating more from the mean. Due to the sensitivity of the mean to outliers, the median is a better data distribution measure to gain further insight regarding the frequency of droughts in each constituency. Drought severity was compared to the official declarations of drought years by the government. Drought frequency was computed as the count of the number of drought years in the entire time series (growing seasons 2000-2001 to 2017-2018). A year with an annual VCI value of 40 or less is identified as drought-stricken and the sum of such drought years per constituency in the entire time series amounts to the frequency of drought  | Land Use-Land Cover Change: In addition to vegetation trends, drought severity was examined according to LULC types. It was also examined at the constituency level, to take into cognisance the environmental and administrative basis of drought impacts, respectively. For each drought year, drought severity effects on each LULC type were assessed based on the intersection of VCI and LULC values for that particular year. Drought intensity is expressed as a percentage of the area under each LULC type affected by varying drought severity and non-drought conditions. Percentages of the surface land area affected were then normalised by the size of the LULC type for each year. Since LULC configurations and sizes vary from one year to another, the annual LULC map for each identified drought year was utilised. Only for the land change analysis aspect was the maps of the years 2000 and 2018 used for post-classification change detection. | Results:  | Vegetation Variability and Trend: The spatial and temporal variations in vegetation productivity were presented based on analyses during the growing seasons, i.e., October to March, of the 18 years. Providing insights regarding each growing season throughout the entire time series, NDVI diff maps (Figure  | Spatio-Temporal Evolution of Drought Severity during Vegetation Growing Seasons: Drought negatively impacts vegetation growth, the supply of water for nature's needs (e.g., to sustain wildlife) and human needs (e.g., for livelihoods and food security).

Remote Sens. 2021, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 20 | Characterising Drought in the Constituencies:  | Drought Severity in Constituencies in Comparison with Drought Declaration: Drought and household food security vulnerability assessments are conducted annually during the mid-growing season in Botswana  | Discussion:  | Vegetation Condition Change and Drought Severity: There was high spatial and temporal variability in vegetation productivity during the growing seasons in the 18-year study period. This is typical of dryland ecosystems which are often non-equilibrium and dynamic in response to both climatic and anthropogenic perturbations 
Comparing vegetation productivity in the CDB during drought and non-drought years with the mean for the entire time series revealed the impacts droughts have on vegetation. For example, when compared to the mean, vegetation productivity was very limited in 2002-2003 (the worst drought episode in the time series). Drought occurrence was evident during the growing seasons of eight declared drought years in line with 
The lower than normal vegetation productivity during some of the drought-stricken growing seasons can be attributed to droughts linked to El Ni√±o southern oscillation (ENSO). For example, the prolonged droughts in the growing seasons of 2002-2004 and 2015-2016 coincided with the El Ni√±o years in the recent records 
Comparing the ongoing growing season (2020-2021) with the mean for the entire time series, we found above-normal vegetation productivity after mid-October 2020 until February 2021. Thus, this suggests the full recovery of vegetation productivity during this season from the impacts of the prolonged droughts in the last couple of growing seasons. However, this observation is somewhat fraught with uncertainty judging from the below-normal vegetation productivity at the start of the season. Moreover, the growing season has not ended yet. The growing season spanning the first dekad in October to the third dekad in March was chosen to align the cropping and the raining season in Botswana, which enabled the exclusion of the dry season from the drought analyses. | Vegetation Trend and Drought Severity by Land Use-Land Cover and Change: Many studies on droughts have not examined how drought effects differ between LULC types. For those that have land use incorporated, little is known of the influence of drought severity on LULC-in terms of the differences in annual sizes and configurationseither in changing and/or persistent areas. Processes driving decreasing vegetation trends, either climatic or anthropogenic, are better identified when LULC and change are incorporated in the examination of drought severity. For example, in CDB between 2000 and 2018, vegetation productivity declined in most forests, woodlands, croplands and grasslands. In land change areas, the trend of declining vegetation was equally high. In areas of persistence, the greatest percentage of improved vegetation productivity was in wetlands, settlements, and otherlands. Minimal improvement of vegetation trends in forested areas can be attributed to the overall increase in tree-covered areas during the study period.
Previous studies in dryland contexts such as Botswana and elsewhere associate the improvement in vegetation productivity partly to bush-encroachment which remote sensing vegetation indices capture as vegetation greening but bush-encroachment is undesirable in cattle-based systems 
Relating LULC change to land degradation, conversion of tree-covered areas to grassland, otherland and cropland, is degrading. This is because these land transitions drive the removal of vegetation cover and contribute to land degradation processes. Similarly considered as degrading land transitions are those involving the conversion of grasslands into croplands, artificial surface areas and otherlands. For example, in Palapye, the authors of 
Drought impacts on grasslands, forests and wetlands imply negative impacts on the cattle system and biodiversity, including wildlife in savannas with the associated tourism and hospitality sector, whereas effects on croplands impact food production. For example, the water crisis of 2015-2016 resulting from relatively low, erratic rainfalls reduced water levels and water inflows into dams drastically across the country  | Drought Severity in the Constituencies: Relating drought severity to the years declared as drought-stricken by the government, the results reveal that not all constituencies were equally affected by drought, as severity differed from severe to mild drought. Moreover, drought severities in some declared drought years were not as widespread in the CDB as in other parts of the country. For example, the growing season of the year 2009-2010 had improved vegetation productivity in response to above-normal rainfall recorded in previous months, which resulted in flooding events in five sub-districts in the CDB (Serowe/Palapye, Tutume, Boteti, Mahalapye and Bobirwa) 
Drought severity was further gauged by the frequency at the constituency level. Over the study period, the constituencies experienced between eight to two drought events. Examples are Mahalapye west and east, with eight and seven drought occurrences, respectively, ranging from moderate to mild drought. Boteti west experienced seven drought events with severity ranging from severe to mild. Confirming these drought frequencies in the CDB, the authors of  | Conclusions: This study proposed a spatial and temporal analysis of drought evolution in the Central District in eastern Botswana from 2000 to 2018. The results highlight the usefulness of incorporating land use-land cover and change in assessing the spatio-temporal variability of drought severity in drylands. Remote Sensing-based vegetation time series metrics were used, as complementary to climatological indices. Indicators characterising changes in vegetation conditions and drought severity during the growing seasons (October to March) from 2000-2001 to 2017-2018 were used. These indicators are NDVI difference-NDVI diff , NDVI anomaly, NDVI trends, Vegetation Condition Index-VCI, Drought intensity and frequency. The use of these different NDVI-based indicators, which might seem redundant, are useful as complementary measures since they differ computation-wise. The NDVI difference as utilised in this study captured the in-season variability in vegetation productivity, whereas the VCI compared each growing season with the long-term minimum and maximum conditions. For example, limited vegetation productivity found during the growing seasons of 2002-2004 and 2015-2016, which was based on both NDVI difference and NDVI anomalies, agreed with the heightened levels of drought severity over the same periods as derived from the VCI.
Results further showed high temporal and spatial variability in vegetation productivity between drought and non-drought conditions in our case studies. The associated negative impact of droughts on vegetation resulting in limited vegetation productivity was further confirmed by results from this study. Drought effects on vegetation productivity during the study period were characterised by decreasing vegetation trends in most parts of the district. Although varying intensities of drought severity (severe, moderate and mild) occurred in the constituencies, the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 growing seasons were found to be the worst drought periods in the entire series, as most parts of the district were affected. Assessing drought severity and intensities by LULC in selected drought years revealed varying drought effects. We found that drought effects differed between LULC types as well as whether these were areas of land change or persistence. Further examination of drought impacts in areas of no change is required, as our understanding of drought effects in areas with no change is still limited. More empirical studies in this regard will provide useful insights. Using the example of the 2002-2003 drought-stricken growing season, the highest percentage of land impacted by extreme and severe droughts were found in tree-covered areas, croplands and grasslands, whereas improved vegetation trends were found mostly in wetlands and some instances in otherland areas including barelands. Moreover, the results suggest that even in declared drought years, droughts severity varied, and the effects differed between constituencies. A further insight provided is that the magnitude of drought severity in some declared drought years was not as widespread in the CDB. For example, no other severe drought levels were recorded in the CDB after the extended drought which affected the growing seasons of 
Remote Sensing-based time series enabled us to extend the analysis up to the ongoing season, demonstrating its usefulness for better characterisation of drought events. Remote Sensing-based results such as those obtained in this study, when provided at multiple administrative scales in a timely and cost-effective manner, have the potential to aid decision-makers to better plan and respond to drought situations. Scientific evidence is needed as input into the decision-making process to aid national resource mobilisation for drought management. Botswana requires both proactive and reactive approaches for drought management, for which remote sensing-based assessment and monitoring foster the implementation of drought early warning systems. | Supplementary Materials:: The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4 292/13/5/836/s1, Table ","Evaluating the impact of drought using Remote Sensing in a Mediterranean, semi-arid region (, 2007) || Understanding the complex impacts of drought: A key to enhancing drought mitigation and preparedness (, , , 2007) || The role of drought among agro-pastoral communities in a semi-arid environment: The case of Botswana (, , , 2013) || Investigating relationship between drought severity in Botswana and ENSO (, , , , , 2020) || Potential impacts of global warming levels 1.5 ‚Ä¢ C and above on climate extremes in Botswana (, , 2019) || Drought Characteristics Assessment in Europe over the Past 50 Years (, , , , , 2020) || Global analysis of bioclimatic controls on ecosystem productivity using satellite observations of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (, , , , , ) || Consequences of widespread tree mortality triggered by drought and temperature stress (, , , 2013) || Drought severity in a changing climate (, , , 2017) || Assessing the response of vegetation photosynthesis to meteorological drought across northern China (, , , , 2021) || Positive feedback between future climate change and the carbon cycle (, , , , , , , , 2001) || Global warming and changes in drought (, , , , , , , 2014) || Observed drought indices show increasing divergence across (, , , , 2017, 7, 14045) || Pan-European seasonal trends and recent changes of drought frequency and severity (, , , 2017) || The southern African climate under 1.5 ‚Ä¢ C and 2 ‚Ä¢ C of global warming as simulated by CORDEX regional climate models (, , , , , , , , 2018) || Impacts of the 2017 flash drought in the US Northern Plains informed by satellite-based evapotranspiration and solar-induced fluorescence (, , , , , , , , , 2019) || Geosystems: An Introduction to Physical Geography (, 2013) || Rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns in South Africa's national parks (, , , , , 2016) || Projections of rapidly rising surface temperatures over Africa under low mitigation (, , , , , , , 2015) || The effects of 1.5 and 2 degrees of global warming on Africa in the CORDEX ensemble (, , , , , , , , , , 2018) || Climate change and variability in semi-arid Palapye; Eastern Botswana: An assessment from smallholder farmers' perspective (, 2017) || Rainfall variability and trends in semi-arid Botswana: Implications for climate change adaptation policy (, , 2010) || Relating the dynamics of climatological and hydrological droughts in semiarid Botswana (, , , 2018) || Prediction of onset and cessation of austral summer rainfall and dry spell frequency analysis in semiarid Botswana (, , , , 2018) || Temperature and precipitation extremes under current, 1.5 ‚Ä¢ C and 2.0 ‚Ä¢ C global warming above pre-industrial levels over Botswana, and implications for climate change vulnerability (, , , 2018) || Drought hazard in Kazakhstan in 2000-2016: A remote sensing perspective (, , , , , , 2019) || Global Drought Watch from space (, 1997) || Remote Sensing of Drought: Progress, Challenges and Opportunities (, , , , , , , 2015. 2014) || Remote Sensing of Drought: Vegetation, Soil Moisture, and Data Assimilation (, , , , 2017) || Effects of Droughts on Vegetation Condition and Ecosystem Service Delivery in Data-Poor Areas: A Case of Bobirwa Sub-District; Limpopo Basin and Botswana (, , , ) ||  (, 2014. 2016. 31 December 2020) || Vegetation dynamics in African drylands: An assessment based on the Vegetation Degradation Index in an agro-pastoral region of Botswana (, , 2019) || Operation of the Global Land Component: Algorithm Theoretical Basis.

Assessing Land Use-Land Cover Change and Its Impact on Land Surface Temperature Using LANDSAT Data: A Comparison of Two Urban Areas in India,Falguni Mukherjee; Deepika Singh,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the spatial and temporal changes in land use and patterns of vegetation and its impacts on land surface temperature (LST) in two Indian cities. Specifically the motivation behind this study is to examine whether a correlation exists between these parameters for the two cities. Indian cities are facing tremendous pressures of rapid urbanization altering the country's land use patterns. This in turn has significantly altered the country's land surface temperature over the years. This study investigates the changes in the land use, land cover and surface temperature in two Indian cities of Surat and Bharuch over a period of 2 decades using Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS datasets. The study also examines changes in vegetation pattern during this period using a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and investigates the correlation between LST and NDVI. Additionally, the study examines the spatial patterns of LST by mapping the directional profiles of LST. Results of the study reveal that over time both the cities have witnessed a dramatic growth in built-up area, systematic reduction in green space and increase in LST. There is 85% increase in builtup area in Surat in the past 2 decades and 31% increase in built-up area in Bharuch during the same period. At the same time, mean surface temperature in Surat has shown an increase of 2.42 ¬∞C per decade while in Bharuch the mean surface temperature has increased by 2.13 ¬∞C per decade. Moreover, examination of correlation between LST and NDVI showed a negative relation between the two parameters. Directional profiles showed a continued increase in temperature from 2008 to 2016 from North to South direction Surat indicating an increased urbanization in that direction. Also, new peaks were observed in the profile of Surat for 2008 and 2016 in the north-south direction indicating urban expansion particularly in the southern part of the city. Moreover, substantial growth has taken place in the central part of the city and along the banks of the rivers Tapi and Narmada. This study will be helpful in investigations that address the challenges of urbanization in Surat and Bharuch by assisting local government officials, land management professionals and planners to determine areas where growth must be curbed to avoid further environmental degradation thereby assisting in systematic urban planning practices.","Introduction: Countries all over the world are undergoing rapid urbanization, and urban areas are expanding at a pace never witnessed before, transforming the urban landscape. A recent United Nations report estimates that 55% of the total world population are urban dwellers and projects that by 2050 the urban population will increase to 68% (United Nations 2018). This would mean an additional 2.5 billion urban dwellers by 2050, and the 2018 UN report estimates that 90% of this increase would occur in Asia and Africa. Thus, the problem is more pronounced in developing countries that have witnessed an emergence of large urban agglomerations (UA) coupled with a rapid urban expansion. This process of urbanization has put a massive strain on the built and natural ecosystem and services of urban areas with far reaching demographic and environmental repercussions. Urban areas in the developing world bear the most consequences of the impacts of environmental degradation and unplanned urbanization coupled with global warming and climate Published in partnership with CECCR at King Abdulaziz University change. This rapid and unplanned urbanization has posed new challenges for planning and governance of urban areas. Urban planners, policy makers and urban residents are thus compelled to find novel and innovative means to adapt to the changing environment and plan urban settlements 
An important parameter to measure the status of urban health is land surface temperature (LST) 
Another important variable used in studying the relation between urbanization and its impacts on climate is land use/ land cover changes (LULC). One of the major causes for alteration in LULC is conversion of vegetation and green cover into impervious surfaces fueled by anthropogenic activities 
Thus, an expansive body of literature 
India is going through a massive process of urbanization. One in every three Indian today dwells in an urban area. As per the latest census, for the first time since independence the growth in population was more in urban areas in India than in rural areas 
Surat is the ninth largest urban agglomeration in India. With a population of approximately 4.6 million, it is the second largest city in the western state of Gujarat and the eight largest city of India. Surat has witnessed unprecedented growth and expansion in the past decade making it one of the fastest growing cities in the country. Similarly, Bharuch is a rapidly expanding urban agglomeration also located in the state of Gujarat. Both Surat and Bharuch are located in south Gujarat, a region known as the Golden Corridor owing to its large reserves of hydrocarbons and massive industrial agglomerations spread throughout the region. Bharuch is the largest urban agglomeration in the most industrialized area of India surrounded by large chemical, petrochemical, engineering, textile and pharmaceutical industries. The region is regarded as the chemical capital of India. Industrial growth in Bharuch has been further facilitated by Dahej Port operated by Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB). Bharuch has also witnessed unparalleled growth in the past decade fueled by industrial development in the region. In light of this, we examine the case of Surat and Bharuch cities to understand the changes in the spatial characteristics of the city's urban landscape and if and how those changes have influenced the land surface temperature in both the cities.
The main goal of this study is to compute the changes in land use patterns and land surface temperature in Surat and Bharuch over a period of 2 decades. To address this objective, multi-temporal satellite images were used to, (1) assess urban change by calculating 
LULC and LST calculations were further validated to establish the accuracy of their assessments from the calculations.
The study presented in this paper is part of a larger study that will examine the impacts of LULC and changing vegetation patterns on LST of several other small urban agglomerations in different parts of India to conduct a comparative analysis. | Study Area: Surat and Bharuch cities are located in the Indian state of Gujarat, one of the fastest urbanizing states in India. More specifically both the cities are located in south Gujarat, part of the Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor and the region is referred as the Golden Corridor of India. Surat and Bharuch are the largest urban agglomerations in south Gujarat. The region along Surat and Bharuch is home to several chemical, petrochemical, textiles and pharmaceutical industrial conglomerates.
Surat, a port city is the eighth largest city and the ninth biggest urban agglomeration in India. It is the second largest city in the state of Gujarat and is the commercial and economic capital of the state and also one of the most prosperous cities of India. The city has witnessed unprecedented growth in recent years and is considered to be one of the fastest growing cities in the world. The primary economic base of this city is textiles and diamond industries which has given Surat the title of Diamond City of India. In recent times, the city has also witnessed an emergence of information and communication technology (ICT)-based industries. Surat is at the forefront as the pioneering city in the Indian government's push toward the use of ICTs for urban governance 
Bharuch, another port city, is one of the biggest industrial areas in India and is also referred to as the chemical capital of India. The region surrounding Bharuch is rich with hydrocarbon reserves with the largest land-based petroleum reserve in India. This has led to a number of engineering, chemical, petrochemical, textile and pharmaceutical Published in partnership with CECCR at King Abdulaziz University industries in the areas surrounding Bharuch. Bharuch is the largest urban area in this industrialized region. Moreover, the city is also home to many metallurgical and port-based industries and houses the only liquid bulk port and chemical terminal in India. Bharuch is one of the major cities along the Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor. | Data and Methods:  | Data: In this study, Landsat 5 TM  | Method for Land Use/Land Cover Classification: A variety of methods are used for image classification 
Traditionally, classification methods have used ISODATA, K-means, minimum distance and maximum likelihood 
Unsupervised classification method does not require prior knowledge of the study area's landscape. Hence, human errors are minimized. The method produces classes based on spectral information and are hence not as subjective as visual   Both the urban areas that were examined in this paper do not have a very complicated terrain with normal land cover species. The main focus of this paper was to examine broad land cover classes in the two urban areas and how those classes have changed over 2 decades. Therefore, unsupervised classification was utilized in this study.
Additionally, this study is part of a larger examination that will evaluate the impacts of LULC and vegetation patterns on LST for several small urban agglomerations in different parts of India for the purpose of comparative analysis. The present study first started with unsupervised classification in order to establish that LULC patterns are changing at an alarming rate for small urban agglomerations in India. Ultimately, the long-term goal is to utilize one or more of the advanced classification algorithms discussed in recent studies 
A thematic raster layer using ISODATA algorithm was generated in ArcGIS. Four land cover classes were identified using the unsupervised classification method that included water, vegetation, built-up and bare soil. | Method for NDVI Extraction from Landsat Data: NDVI is widely utilized in studies examining presence of green cover and status and health of vegetation. The index is used based on the rationale that vegetation reacts to the absorption and reflection of red and near-infrared lights. NDVI values range from -1 to 1. A value of zero indicates the presence of urban areas while a negative value is an indication of a water body. A positive value closer to one indicates the presence of green cover  | Method for Extracting LST from Thermal Band of Landsat Data: Spectral radiance method 
(1) NDVI = (NIR -Red) After the extraction process, the retrieved spectral radiance was converted to surface temperature using the following formula Here T B is surface temperature, K 1 and K 2 are thermal conversion constants.
In order to convert the temperature units to Celsius, absolute zero (approx. -273.15) is added to the above formula 
In order to retrieve surface temperature from band 10 of the Landsat 8 TIRS data, values from the above two equations, vegetation fraction and land surface emissivity were used. Vegetation fraction F V was computed using the following formula 
Here NDVI min represents minimum NDVI value indicating the presence of bare soil and NDVI max is maximum NDVI value indicating the presence of healthy vegetation 
Emissivity Œµ was calculated using the formula Finally, Land Surface Temperature (LST) was calculated using the following equation 
Here h is Plank's constant (6.626 √ó 10 -34 Js), c is the velocity of light in vacuum (2.998 √ó 10 -8 m/s), Œª is effective wavelength (10.9 mm for band 10 in Landsat 8 data), œÉ is Boltzmann constant (1.38 √ó 10 -23 J/K). | Correlation Analysis: After computing NDVI and LST, zonal statistics was calculated for each LULC class to summarize NDVI and LST values. Regression analysis was employed to compute the correlation between LST and NDVI.
(3) | Accuracy Assessment of Land Use Classification: After calculating the above values, accuracy assessment was conducted to determine how close the computed values are to the true values on ground.
To assess the accuracy of the classified image a confusion matrix (Table 
Overall accuracy measures the accuracy of the classification process by determining whether all reference sites are correctly classified and mapped. Overall accuracy is calculated using the following equation 
Here r is number of rows and columns in error matrix, N is total number of observations (pixels), x ii is observation in row i and column i, Xi+ is marginal total of row i, X + i is marginal total of column i.
(11) | LST Validation: A widely used method for validating LST is by using/comparing near-surface air temperature 
Real-time surface air temperature data were derived from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) website for the meteorological station in the study area. | Results:  | LULC Change: In this study, four LULC classes were assigned viz. vegetation, water body, built-up area and bare soil (Figs. 
Figure 
Figure  | LST Change: LST was calculated for 1998, 2008 and 2016 for Surat and Bharuch. Figure

In case of Bharuch, the mean surface temperature increased by 2.13 ¬∞C per decade. As shown in Tables 
In order to validate LST calculations, daily summary surface temperature collected at the meteorological station was compared with the calculated  | LST and NDVI Correlation: To assess the correlation between LST and NDVI in both the cities, regression analysis and correlation analysis were conducted.
In case of Surat, linear regression showed a coefficient of determination (r 2 ) of 0.965 for 1998, 0.969 for 2008 and 0.88 for 2016 (Fig.  | Directional Profile: Four directional profiles were generated for the study areas, i.e., North-South (N-S), East-West (E-W), Northwest-Southeast (NW-SE) and Northeast-Southwest (NE-SW) to validate the spatial distribution of LST.
In case of Surat, N-S profile of LST for 1998, 2008 and 2016 showed an initial drop in temperature but then showed continued increase in temperature during 2008 and 2016 owing to the increased urbanization from North to South direction as shown in Fig. 
In case of Bharuch, not much of a difference was observed in the LST values for different years in each of the four directional profile, i.e., E-W, NE-SW, N-S and NW-SE. Hence, the profile for 2016 is only highlighted in each of the four zones. Highest peak was observed in NW-SE directional profile (Fig. 
As shown in Fig. 
As shown in Fig.  | Discussion: Both Surat and Bharuch have witnessed unprecedented growth in the last 2 decades. While Surat has expanded in all the directions, Bharuch has expanded along the banks of the river. Along with urban expansion, both the cities have witnessed a systematic increase in their temperature. This in turn has exposed both the cities to a variety of infrastructural and climate-related problems. Surat and Bharuch have undergone massive industrialization since 2000 due to the State Government's renewed political agenda of development that has pushed for urbanization and industrialization in the State 
The rapid growth and expansion has presented its own sets of problems for the cities. Urban expansion has come at the cost of agricultural land. Poor farmers who own small lands have been marginalized, further deepening rural poverty. The SEZs have acquired farmland and pastoral land for different industrial projects 
Increase in surface temperature coupled with loss of vegetation to built-up area over the years has made both the cities more vulnerable to natural hazards, viz. flooding, The Ukai multipurpose dam was built over Tapi river in the 1970s for the purpose of irrigation, power generation and flood control. The dam is located around 100 kms upstream from Surat. Heavy rainfall in the dam's catchment area in the neighboring state of Maharashtra leads to heavy inflow into the dam's reservoir which when discharged leads to flooding in Surat. Rapid urban expansion of Surat has further exacerbated the problem. Urban expansion in Surat along the banks of the river on both the sides has greatly modified the hydrology by increasing the built-up areas, encroachment of constructions in the floodplains adjacent to the river and construction of new bridges which has reduced the capacity of the river and the open space for the floodwaters to spread out. Additionally, Hazira industrial area located in Hazira SEZ downstream from Surat has grown exponentially over the years by reclaiming sections of the floodplain, reducing the mouth of Tapi River where it meets the sea (  | Conclusion: This study has shown that since 1998-2016 both Surat and Bharuch have experienced a loss in vegetation while land surface temperature during that period has increased Published in partnership with CECCR at King Abdulaziz University consistently rising from 1998 to 2016. Additionally during this period both the cities have also experienced an increase in its built-up area and a consistent reduction in water, vegetation and soil, indicating a rapid expansion of urban areas at the cost of its vegetation, soil and water bodies. Surat has expanded over an area of approximately 50.51 sq. kms while Bharuch has expanded slightly over an area of 3.4 sq. kms during this period in multi-directions. Surat has grown over a much larger area as compared to Bharuch during the study period. Nonetheless, both the cities have witnessed an increase in land surface temperature. In case of Surat, land surface temperature was particularly elevated in the central part of the city which is a heavily urbanized area, representing a strong correlation between urban expansion and land surface temperature. In case of both of the cities, growth along the water body was noticeable. However, the results from this study must be read with some caution. Firstly, Landsat data that have been used in this study generate imageries with low-to-moderate spectral resolution. Secondly, this study has utilized unsupervised classification for LULC analysis that imparts uncertainty in classified data 
Surat is one of the fastest growing cities of India with a rapidly increasing urban population while Bharuch is heavily industrialized area facing rapid urbanization. This has exerted an enormous pressure on the urban environment of both the cities. Rapid and chaotic urban expansion accompanied with high surface temperature has made both the cities vulnerable to diseases, natural hazards like flooding, increased pollution and reduced industrial productivity. This observed phenomena is very similar to other mega cities in India and across the globe and it is high time that cities like Surat and Bharuch start paying attention to the ramifications of industrialization, development and urbanization. Local Government officials in Surat for instance have started heeding the consequences of urban expansion. Surat was one the pioneering member cities of the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network (ACCCRN) established by the Rockefeller Foundation. The main goals of the network focus on ameliorating Surat's flood risk management strategies, public health emergency preparedness and infrastructure 
The present study has addressed an important issue by providing a detailed analysis of land transformation and surface temperature change in one of the fastest urbanizing areas of India. Medium and small urban agglomerations all over the world particularly in developing countries are facing tremendous pressures of urbanization and the process will continue for the next several decades. Urban areas continue to grow at the cost of green spaces, agricultural land and rural areas. In many parts of the world, urban areas are pushing into the most vulnerable parts of the environment as also witnessed in Surat and Bharuch. Coupled with this, issues of climate change and shifting weather patterns pose a challenging problem for environmental planning and urban and land management. Studies like the one conducted here can assist land use and land management professionals and policy makers in making policy decisions to manage urban areas and curb the impacts of rapid and haphazard urbanization.

Land Use Policy,Alemenesh Hailu; Siraj Mammo; Moges Kidane,"Information on Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes and the driving forces behind such modifications underpin a proper understanding of the dynamics of LULC changes. This study aimed to analyse the dynamics of LULC change trends and its driving factors in Jimma Geneti District (JGD) for the year 1973-2019. Five satellite images downloaded from USGS were used to analyze and assess the geospatial and temporal changes in LULC. In addition, in-depth household interviews, key informant interview, focus group discussions (FGD) and field observations were used to address the drivers of LULC changes. The result showed a decline in forest land from 8632.5 ha (20.9 %) in 1973-5647.23 ha (13.7 %) in 2019. The study further revealed that the total of forest land cleared between 1973 and 2019 was estimated to be 2985.27 ha (7.22 %). In other words, 34.6 % of the forest cover that existed in 1973 was lost. Similarly, wetlands declined from 9919.5 ha (24.0 %) in 1973-2000.24 ha (4.8 %) in 2019. Similarly, wetlands declined from 9919.5 ha (24.0 %) in 1973-2000.24 ha (4.8 %) in 2019. On the other hand, cultivated land has increased from 18617.0 ha (45.1 %) to 27708.1 ha (67.1 %). Similarly, the increment in settlement areas has elevated from 908.7 ha (2.2 %) to 4436.46 ha (10.7 %) during the same period. Agricultural expansion, cutting trees for various purposes (such as firewood, charcoal and construction material), overgrazing and the expansion of settlements, were identified as the major proximate causes of these changes. Moreover, the major underlying drivers of LULC changes include population growth, changes in policy and institutions, poverty and lack of awareness on the importance of natural resource conservation for sustainable livelihoods. From this study, it can be concluded that JGD has experienced a significant change in LULC over the past 46 years and were affected both positively and negatively. Hence, a wide range of policy packages are required for sustainable land management practices which take in to account synergies and trade-offs between the various land uses in the study area. The national and local governments should enforce sustainable land management approaches through integrating land use planning and management into all development programmes and projects.","Introduction: Land is an indispensable natural resource, which has enormous economic, social and biophysical uses. As a result, land use and land cover (LULC) are under a continuous changes mainly because of societal development and natural causes. LULC changes are fundamental processes on the earth's surface and have significant impacts on human society, climate, biodiversity, hydrological cycles, ecosystems, biogeochemical cycles and many other processes 
Changes in land cover have become key components of global environmental change and represent impact of human activity 
Apositive side of LULC change is agricultural land expansion, which increases food production for a rapidly growing population. Although, LULC change has social and economic benefits, it has also been reported to have an impact on spatial patterns of landscape properties by modifying ecosystems at local, regional and global levels 
Generally, LULC changes are driven by natural factors and anthropogenic activities 
Since 1950, the world population has increased exponentially and this growth is producing major changes in LULC. In Ethiopia, population growth has been identified as the main driving force in LULC change and is contributing to natural resource degradation 
As it is aforementioned above, land cover change is a widespread phenomenon and LULC change has increasingly become a key research priority for national and international research programs examining global natural resources and environmental change 
Among several factors affecting LULC changes in Ethiopa, the three major factors include population growth, increasing agricultural investments and resettlement programmes  | Material and methods:  | Description of the study area: The study site, Jimma Geneti District(JGD) is located in HoroGuduruWollega Zone, Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. The district covers a total area of 48,251 ha (482.51 sq.km) (Fig. 
The major livelihood activity of the population in the district is mixed-farming (JGDANRO, 2018) with crop cultivation being the major agricultural activity, which is entirely rain-fed, with livestock rearing as a secondary activity. Pertaining to this, there are different types of land use observed in the study area (Table 
The total population of Jimma Geneti district is 93,711, out of which  | Data sources and acquisition method 2.2.1. Satellite data acquisition method: Globally, satellite images are playing a vital role in monitoring spatial and temporal landscape change  | Household survey: The data for the drivers of LULC change were collected from 134 household heads selected randomly to participate in in-depth interviews, key informants interview and focus group discussions (FGD). A three stage sampling technique was employed in selecting the district, administration and household respondents, by combining purposive and random sampling, while the household respondents were selected by systematic random sampling. Accordingly, out of 4531 households, 134 were selected (48 households from Gidami Dabsho, 32 from AdilekaTulu Chali Keble, and 54 from Damu Gembo Kebele). Moreover, participants as key informants and FGDs were selected purposively from each sampled (village). One FGD constituted of six to eight members from different social groups (youth, women and elders). Data collected from questioners were coded and categorized into a suitable data entry format using statistical package for social scientists (SPSS) window version 20.0 software and described by using frequency and percentage.
The sample size of the survey study was determined following 
e 2 (N-1) +Z 2 *p *q Where n = sample size Z = 95 confidence limit (interval) under normal curve that is 1.96 P = 0.1(proportion of the population to be included in the sample that is 10 %) q = none occurrence of event = 1-0.1 that is (0.9) N = Total number of household = 4531 e = margin of error or degree of accuracy (accepted error term) (0.05) Thus, n=1.96 2 *0.1*0.9*4531 = 134 0.05 2 (4531-1) +1.96 2 *0.1*0.9 | Image preparation and processing: As raw satellite images are affected by systematic and random errors and were, not directly utilized for feature identification and any applications. Therefore, some image corrections were carried out following the methods in the literature 
As it has been repeatedly described, in image analysis, ground reference data play an important role to determine information classes, interpret decisions and assess accuracies of results  | Table 1: LULC classes and their thematic description in the study area. | LULC class Description: Settlement area Areas occupied by residential houses and other buildings Bare Land
Exposed stone, sand and soil or area with no vegetation or dominated by rock-out crops, roads, eroded and degraded lands Forest Land Land with more than 0.5 ha, with a tree canopy cover of more than 10 %, which is not primarily under agricultural or other specific non-forest land use (FAO, 2000) Cultivated land
Areas of land ploughed/prepared for growing crops by rain fed or irrigation, including fallow plots and degraded grazing land with very few scattered vegetation Water Body
Areas of land covered with water (lakes and rivers) Wet Land
Areas that is waterlogged or swampy during the wet season and relatively dry during the dry season. It also includegrazing land around the wetland.
were employed for satellite image processing and LULC change analysis.
ERDAS Imagine Software was also used to perform classification and post classification comparison of change detection, which involves the application of multi-temporal datasets to analyze the changes between consecutive classification years. This is a process of sorting pixels into a finite number of individual classes or categories of data, based on their data file values 
The reconnaissance survey, assisted by information collected from the FGD coupled with interpretation of remotely sensed satellite images was employed. Each satellite image was classified into different LULC classes, using supervised image classification coupled with the maximum likelihood classification algorithm. Ground truth data collection was carried out for collecting absolute location of different land use, for the use as training sites during classification and for accuracy assessment of the classified LULC map of 2019. A total of 180 ground control point (GCPs), 30 for each LULC type, were collected randomly from the study areas. The final images were converted to LULC maps. The temporal and spatial change observed between five classification intervals were statistics computed and presented in three different ways. These are the total LULC in ha, the percentage LULC changes and the rate of change between classification periods (Fig.  | Result and discussion:  | Accuracy assessment: The overall producer's accuracy assessment for the year 2019 was found to be 83 %, with 96 % for cultivated land and 94 % for settlement areas (Table  | LULC classes of the study area: Six major types of LULC were identified by using field data and satellite images of the years of 
To understand the changes occurring within a period of time, temporal analysis approach was carried out. Also, LULC dynamic results were obtained by using combined methods of remote sensing and GIS techniques from Landsat images of the aforementioned years. Statistical summaries of the different LULC dynamics are presented in Table  | Land Use Land Cover: The highest increment in the percentage of cultivated land (and hence diminishing of wetland and forestland) has been observed between the years of 1987 and 1995, which can be attributed to the spike in small-scale farming (Table 
It is worth mentioning that this finding is in line with prior studies that reported 44 % growth in agriculture and 36.4 % agricultural land increment, respectively, by  | Bare land (BL): . Bare lands have also been transformed into another land use types. In the study area under consideration, it was found that the bare land proportion has shown significant declines over the span of years. Indeed, the data obtained shows a decline of the bare land proportion from 2872.1 ha (7%) in 1973, to 551.34 ha (1.3 %) in 2019 and a progressive decline between the stated years (Table 
Computed from the collected data, it can be seen that the bare land has been converted to other land use types at the rate of 50.45ha/year during the study periods of 1973-2019 (Table 
In this regard, it is also worth indicating that the results of this study are similar to a number other previous studies undertaken in different parts of Ethiopia. For instance,  | Wetland (WL).: The result of the study further revealed a continuous decline in the overall area of wetland with the average rate of 172.6 ha/year from year of 1973-2019. As can be seen in Table 
The result of this study is in agreement with the study of 
Most croplands were situated in relatively flat areas in 1957, however, these areas were affected by the construction of the Fincha dam in 1973 
BL-bare land, CL-cultivated land, FL-forestland, SA-settlement area, WB-water body, WL-wetland.
The result indicated a series of LULC changes over the last 46 years . In this regard, the trend shows a tendency towards more plots of lands being shifted to be used for cultivation and settlement. At the same time, the water body becomes more important. On the contrary, the coverages of bare-lands and wetlands have declined in size as they have been converted to cultivation and settlement areas. This is inline with the findings of  | LULC change matrix: An important aspect of change detection is to determine what is really changing and to which LULC type, i.e., which land use class is changing to other types of land use class 
In this study, though some areas gained from other LULC classes, shrinkage was also observed in forest cover and bare land over the entire study period. The largest area of change matrix was observed from wetland to cultivated land, as compared to other land uses. The dominant contributors to the decline of forest cover were the conversions of forest land to cultivated land 3608.44 ha (41.8 %), wetlands 965.52 ha (11.18 %) and settlement areas 717.72 ha (8.3 %) as shown in (Table 
While some parts of the original cultivated land was were lost to other LULC classes, such as settlement area, 1983.87 ha(10.66 %) and it has also expanded, mainly due to area gains from wetlands,5445.92 ha (54.9 %), forest land, 3608.44 ha (41.8 %) and bare land, 2069.82 ha (72 %), as shown in (Table  | Analysis of rate and patterns of LULC dynamics 1973-2019: During the 1973-2019 years periods, three land use types had shown an increasing trend; cultivated land (48.83 %), settlement areas (38.8 %) and water bodies (164 %). During this period, forest land 2985.27ha (34.6 %), bare land 2320.76 ha (80.8 %) and wetland 7919.26 ha (395.9 %), was lost in the study area. Particularly, the highest amount of wetland coverage accounted for 6652.08ha has been lost during the period 1987-1995. Likewise, the forest ecosystem, which covered1833.15 ha also declined between 1973-1987 (Table 
Regarding LULC change, agricultural land increased annually by 
Within the 46 years of this study period, bare and forest lands have shown consistent reductions, whereas cultivated lands and forest lands increased at the expense of the aforementioned as well as a wetland, land use types. However, wetlands and water body has shown inconsistencies in changes of their coverages (Table  | Drivers of LULC changes:  | Proximate drivers: From data gathered from the respondents, a total of eight factors were identified as the major direct drivers of LULC dynamics in the study area (Fig. 
The Majority of the respondents also identified firewood collection (93.3 %), house construction/settlement (90 %), land degradation (88.8 %), overgrazing (88.8 %,) and charcoal making (87.3) (Fig. 
Respondents also viewed overgrazing as an important driver of changes in the study area 
Cutting of Cordia africana, Podocarpus falcatus and Juniperus procera for timber trade was (58.2 % of respondents) registered as another prominent factor that threatened the forest cover of the study area. Rapid population growth resulted in huge demands for timber for construction purposes in the surrounding towns and villages, triggering illegal loggings from among communal forests. Through time, depletion of forests (a decline of forest areas) continued triggering the like of timber prices in towns (Plate 3 ). As acknowledged by the respondents, although the government has put strong regulations in place to prevent illegal logging, such activity is still continuing cutting down of trees for different purposes
Infrastructure developments, such as schools and roads, were also found to have contributed to the decline of grazing lands. Respondents (76.9 %) argued that the expansion of rural and urban settlements was the cause of LULC dynamics in the JGD. Previous studies (for example  | Underlying causes of LULC dynamics: Most respondents (90.3 %) confirmed that population growth is the most important underlying driver of LULC dynamics (Fig. 
The results of the FGDs are also in line with CSA reports showing increments in a total population of the study area. In 1994 the population of the study area was 47,199 
Policy and institutional factors were found to be the underlying drivers of LULC dynamics accounting for about 76.1 % of respondents. According to the information obtained from FGDs, the villagization policy called""Sefera"" where people were clustered into villages during the Derge regime, which means the resettlement policy contributed to the expansion of settlements and agriculture land. National and regional policies on land use and economic development, such as infrastructural expansion (e.g. roads, schools, markets etc.), attaining food self-sufficiency through investment in agriculture are other factors contributing to LULC change. Lack of proper land use plans is another policy related driver of forest and vegetation cover change. It is characterized by the encroachment of vegetated lands especially forest, grazing land and cultivation on steep slopes.
Information obtained from FGDs indicates that manifestations of weak law enforcement in the study area resulted in corruption and delays in decision-making by courts. Participants also said that change in land tenure systems was another policy-related driver of forest and vegetation cover change. During the Derge regime, large areas of forest and grazing land were converted to other land use types, due to change in the land policy from the previous government 
Distribution of land and resource among small-scale farmers following the 1975 'land to tiller policy' which means the land and the resources were divided into pieces among peasants or smallholding farmers.
However, the current FDRE government considers the land as public property and land is, therefore, administered by the government 
Poverty, unemployment, lack of off-farm jobs (especially among the landless and educated youth), and change in rural economic activities are the main economic causes of LULC dynamics in the study area. About 85.1 % of respondents and FGD participants stated that the major underlying economic factors behind the expansion of agricultural land are illegal logging, charcoal making and firewood extraction. Due to lack of off-farm employment opportunities, adults in the study area who remain are unemployed. This results in land fragmentation as land is shared within families and encroachment of forest areas in search of new land for cultivation and firewood take place. Hence, economically poor and landless households are engaged in logging in the form of charcoal and firewood to be able to provide for their families. World Commission on Environment and Development points out that people who are poor and hungry devastate their immediate environment in order to survive 
Socio-cultural factors were found to be an important underlying driving force of LULC change by 85.1 % of respondents. Lack of awareness about the negative impacts of forest conversion, distribution of land and other resources are the socio-cultural causes for the expansion of agricultural lands at the expense of other LULC types, mainly wetland and forests.
The main limitationIt of this study include shortage of time and small finical support to collect ground truth for verification, gather information from respondents on drivers of LULC changes and interpretation and the difficult of classification of images due to similarity of spectral signature of features in mapping urban land use land cover changes | Conclusion and recommendation: This study has analyzed the dynamics of land use and land cover and explored the drivers over the past 46 years  in the study area. Analyses of LULC dynamics over four decades using GIS and remote sensing tools produced six types of LULC categories. Land use classes experienced prominent land cover dynamics during the study period. Quantitative spatio-temporal evidence produced through interpretations of satellite images showed that the study area has undergone significant LULC change since 1973.
The LULC types were affected both positively and negatively in the last 46 years. The pattern of the LULC change in different categories showed variation during the five periods considered 
LULC dynamics in the study area were attributed to a combination of drivers (proximate and underlying causes), i.e. the proximate causes include agricultural expansion, particularly small scale farming, wood extraction for firewood and charcoal making, construction of infrastructure (for example schools, roads), overgrazing and expansion of rural and urban settlements, whereas population pressure, policy and institutions, poverty, lack of awareness and biophysical factors were claimed as major underlying drivers of LULC change.
Results of this study could help decision making bodies as it provides information that supports to take measures involving integrated land use planning and management and future developments.","Land use and land cover (LULC) change and socio-economic conditions of local community in the central highlands of Ethiopia (, , , , , 2014) || A Review and Assessment of Land-Use Change Models: Dynamics of Space (, 2002) || The implications of land use and land cover changes for rural household food insecurity in the North eastern highlands of Ethiopia: the case of the Teleyayen sub-watershed (, , 2017) || Land use land cover change trend and its drivers in somodo watershed south western, Ethiopia (, , , 2019) || Land use and land cover changes and associated driving forces in north western lowlands of Ethiopia (, , , , 2015) ||  (, , , , , , 2014) || Land use/cover changes between 1966 and 1996 in Chirokella micro-watershed, South eastern Ethiopia.

"Integrated modeling of hydrological processes and groundwater recharge based on land use land cover, and climate changes: A systematic review",Jacob Mensah; Eric Ofosu; Mark Yidana; Komlavi Akpoti; Amos Kabo-Bah,"Groundwater is the main available freshwater resource and therefore its use, management and sustainability are closely related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, Land Use Land Cover (LULC) and climate change are among the factors impacting groundwater recharge. The use of land-use and climate data in conjunction with hydrological models are valuable tools for assessing these impacts on river basins. This systematic review aimed at assessing the integrated modeling approach for evaluating hydrological processes and groundwater recharge based on LULC and climate change. The analysis is based on 200 peer-reviewed articles indexed in Scopus, and the Web of Science. Continuous research and the development of context-specific groundwater recharge models are essential to increase the long-term viability of water resources in any basin. The long-term impacts of natural and anthropogenic drivers on river basin interactions require integrating knowledge and modeling capabilities across biophysical responses, environmental problems, policies, economics, social, and data.","Introduction: Global freshwater extraction was estimated at 3.99 trillion m 3 in 2014 
Groundwater recharge and sustainability are critical challenges for the world's fastest-growing population areas, particularly the arid and semi-arid regions that depend on the resource for domestic, industrial, and agricultural needs. Therefore, the establishment of good groundwater management systems is crucial to achieving the SDGs. However, the effects of urbanization have been experiential in numerous ways such as runoff changes and drought, recharge of groundwater, scarcity of water due to increasing demand and others 
Climate change is one of the recent key hydrological research problems 
A detailed understanding of groundwater inputs and outputs is required to guide water management choices for future planning and policy. In addition to analytical regression equations

Groundwater recharge is controlled by a variety of elements including climate, vegetation, unsaturated area, flow mechanism and thickness of the aquifer  | Materials and methods:  | Design of the study: A systematic literature review was conducted to determine the usefulness of an integrated modeling strategy for predicting groundwater recharge under changing climate and land use land cover changes. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) was employed based on  | Summary of literature selection: The systematic review process captured articles through some of the main repositories including, the Web of Science and Scopus. For the preliminary investigation, Boolean search in scientific research engines and platforms were utilized, with an emphasis on keywords such as integrated modeling, land use and land cover change, hydrological responses, climate change, groundwater recharge, and other specific known techniques (GIS, SWAT, MODFLOW, WETSPAS, and so on) at the local, regional, national, and global levels. In all, 3282 articles were obtained because of the searches executed through all sources. After excluding 1235 duplicate articles, a total of 2047 articles were left for screening, and a further 1347 articles were deleted after filtering titles and abstracts. The complete texts of 700 possibly suitable articles were reviewed to determine their relevance. After this stage of filtering, 500 papers were eliminated, allowing 200 for inclusion in the review. Articles that were more than 10 years of age were largely omitted from the list, with a focus on those connecting future land use and land cover changes and groundwater recharge to climate change, in keeping with the objectives of the review. The PRISMA flow chart (Fig. 
A random selection of review articles released in the last decade  were those considered for the analyses, it does not however include conference proceedings. The search was restricted to English-language peer-reviewed journal papers. The journals chosen had enough material regarding GW recharge modeling in connection to LULC, the majority of which indicated the possibility of modeling GW recharge or surface-groundwater interactions, as well as hydrological modeling. The collection included a total of 200 scholarly articles as shown in (Fig.  | Summary and development of a catalogue: The number of scientific articles reviewed for this publication is from America, Africa, and Asia. Over 50 countries contributed 180 peerreviewed publications, with 61 from Africa, 49 from Asia, 43 from America, 24 from Europe, and 2 from Australia.

Climate change may affect watershed hydrologic systems by altering temperature and precipitation regimes 
Climate change impacts on hydrologic processes such as surface runoff, streamflow, baseflow, and evapotranspiration have been documented in most parts of the world. 
Integrated modeling is needed to better understand how future climate and land-cover changes may affect watersheds in different regions. Most urban watersheds might benefit greatly from the use of finescale urban development predictions, downscaled climate projections, and process-based hydrologic models to produce insights for water resource managers. Simplified and integrated hydrological modeling, or distributed and theoretical modeling, are the integral parts of these approaches.

While hydrological conditions will be modified by climate change, it will also affect groundwater resources indirectly via their interaction with surface water bodies

Li and Fang (2021) used the Delta downscaling approach to examine climate change impacts on streamflow. Calibration of the model predicts projected minimum monthly temperature rises of 1.5 ‚Ä¢ C, 2 ‚Ä¢ C, and 3 ‚Ä¢ C for all RCPs (2.6, 4.5, and 8.5) respectively. Rainfall is expected to decline in the 2030s and then rise to 8.9%, 12.89%, and 13.9% in the three scenarios, while streamflow is anticipated to increase by 10.5%, 20.1%, and 23.2% from 2020 to 2093 under the three RCP scenarios. The authors reiterated dry season streamflow is also expected to decline by 1.1% and rise by 3.2% in the rainy season. 
Streamflow is anticipated to rise 0.5-4 times due to early snowmelt, and snow cover will be declining at lower altitudes and increasing at higher elevations by the end of the century. The water cycle is known to be affected by LULC processes and climate change. These findings   
Changes in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) may greatly affect a drainage basin's runoff characteristics, which in turn affects the area's surface and groundwater availability. It is noteworthy to estimate the influence of LULC change on runoff characteristics of the northern region in general and minor watershed levels (sub-basin levels) on groundwater hydrology. The SWAT model has also shown promise in analyzing the consequences of LULC change on hydrology. In East Africa, Ethiopian researchers  | Conclusion: The systematic review examined a total of 200 papers on integrated modeling approaches and highlighted research trends, as well as the effects of LULC and climate change on groundwater recharge. This review has demonstrated that over the last few decades, advances in research have shown that groundwater recharge may be simulated using a variety of approaches and instruments. The systematic review revealed significant information on the effects of LULC, and climate change on groundwater recharge, which has implications for LULC planning. It demonstrates that the effect of climate change on aquifer recharging is reflected in declines in the water table because of temperature increases, rainfall variability, and increased evapotranspiration.
Several of the research examined used hydrological or hydrogeological models, as well as empirical statistical models and evapotranspiration models. Other researchers employed ecohydrological models to determine the relationship between climatic factors and groundwater levels. Numerous studies have been conducted that consider severe occurrences, such as the repercussions of harmful anthropogenic effects. Recent research has demonstrated the value of an integrated modeling strategy for evaluating the effect of land-use changes on water resources. The papers reviewed advocated for the use of a spatially explicit land-use simulation model in conjunction with a hydrological model as a useful tool for assessing the influence of landuse change and climate change on groundwater recharge. The reactions to LULC changes vary, indicating the need of conducting site-specific research to fully understand the consequences of LULC changes. Such research must measure the combined effects of several stressors, such as LULC, climate, landscape, and soil qualities. Finally, the findings of this research emphasize the need for integrated modeling for assessing changes in groundwater resources.

"Monitoring land use and land cover change near a nuclear power plant construction site: Akkuyu case, Turkey",Muzaffer Can; Ezgi Sahin; M Iban,". The agricultural areas in the study area were changed into other LULC classes: 9.1% to artificial surfaces, 27.6% to barren lands, and 21.7% to forest. The rise in the area of artificial surfaces was especially noticeable within the 1 km buffer zone: construction activities converted 36.1% of agricultural fields, 54.1% of forests, and 23.2% of barren lands into artificial surfaces. The filling activities on the seashore resulted in a loss of water bodies of up to 26.5%. The study provides an overview of how the LULC classes have evolved on the construction site and in the region. In the end, the study discusses how the current land use preferences in the region contradict the issues and concerns mentioned in the existing body of literature.","Introduction: Although the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 has had a significant influence on nuclear energy development in recent years, nuclear energy, as a low-carbon energy source, is presently an alternative energy source that can be produced on a large scale. Despite a modest decline in nuclear output after Fukushima, nuclear power generation has continued to increase in recent Abstract Land use and land cover (LULC) change analysis of the construction site and its surroundings of the Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant project in southern Turkey was undertaken in this case study, which was supported by remotely sensed Landsat 8 image composites. The composite images compiled in 2017 and 2021 were prepared on the Google Earth Engine platform. The Random Forest algorithm was used as the classifier model. A high classification performance was obtained for both images (kappa > 0.88, overall accuracy > 90%). After the classification process, LULC maps for both years were generated, and statistical calculations for the LULC change were computed for both the entire study area (15 √ó 25 km) and a buffer zone with a radius of 1 km around the power plant. In the whole study area, artificial surfaces significantly increased (78.46%), whereas forests (-8.31%) and barren lands experienced a considerable decrease (-6.11%). In the 1 km buffer, artificial surfaces predominantly increased (113.94%), while forests and barren lands decreased dramatically Vol:. 
Many researchers have conducted systematic studies on the environmental impact assessment 
Monitoring LULC changes enables scientists to get a picture of the interconnection between natural geography and human activities. Once humanity rules over the natural environment, such inhabited areas become more populated and the dynamics of the natural environment change significantly 
The preceding case studies on LULC served a variety of goals. However, the principal goal of recent works was to track the land use changes 
The research of LULC change relies heavily on RS products. Remotely sensed image classification is regarded as a key activity in image processing and is therefore employed in the extraction of knowledge from LULC data by classifying the spectral signs 
LULC change analyses for other types of power plants have been put into practice by researchers, and it has been proven that such analyses help measure the impact of power plants on the natural and built environment. For instance, 
This study tracks the LULC changes surrounding the Akkuyu NPP, which is under construction now in the south of Turkey, with the help of the classification of multi-temporal remotely sensed data. In the second section, a literature review on the LULC policies and preferences around NPPs is presented, and the background of the Akkuyu NPP project and related LULC policies are introduced. In the third section, the study area and its extent are demonstrated. In the fourth section, information about the datasets used in the study, the classification scheme of satellite images, accuracy assessment, and LULC change analysis are given. In the fifth section, the quantitative and comparative results of the LULC change analysis are demonstrated. LULC maps for the years 2017 and 2021 are presented, and the LULC change is illustrated to shed light on how the Akkuyu NPP project increases the use of land for built-up spaces and negatively affects the natural land cover. The sixth section discusses how the current land use preferences in the region contradict the issues and concerns mentioned in the existing body of literature. | Background: The construction of NPPs has a consequential impact on the terrestrial and marine environment. Even though NPPs do not require a massive land area for energy production, just like hydropower, solar, and wind energy 
Destroyed vegetation (agricultural and barren lands, forests) must be taken into account in the first place, as it can lead to erosion, local pollution, and a decrease in groundwater sources 
The construction of NPPs has an impact on builtup areas and the local population. An increase in the population densities around NPPs can occur due to the influx of labor forces 
Turkey is one of the countries that still intends to benefit from nuclear power without revising its original plans despite the Fukushima and Chernobyl disasters. The central government has been coordinating the planning and installation of NPPs as a step forward in energy independence and scientific advancement. Turkey intends to set up three NPPs that are expected to meet 15% of its electricity needs 
Akkuyu Project Company (APC) in 2011 and the produced report was reviewed and approved by the Turkish Energy, Nuclear and Mining Research Authority and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Then, the environmental impact assessment report for the project was prepared and submitted by the APC. The Turkish Ministry of Environment and Urbanization approved this assessment report in 2013 
According to the IAEA's guide 
The Environmental Land Use Plan (ELUP) at a scale of 1:100000 covering the provinces of Mersin and Adana was entered into force in 2018 and has been updated 18 times so far. This plan also covers the Akkuyu NPP construction area. The ELUP does not contain any statement about controlling the LULC around the Akkuyu NPP. The expected policy outcome should be to limit new development that may attract migration and keep the population density below a certain level in the region. Paradoxically, the plan shows that large-scale development areas, which may lead to a significant population rise, are planned for the rural settlements in the region. The ELUP does not suggest any method that limits the number of residential units for prospective employees. Instead, it seems that the government is addressing new development areas around rural villages to supply the housing needs of the labor force. The Akkuyu Region is sparsely populated, and the main driver of the regional economy is agricultural production. Nonetheless, the land use decisions taken in the ELUP will accelerate urbanization in the region. Furthermore, the APC states that they will monitor the environment during the construction and help to reclamate and revegetate the land affected by the construction. However, neither the APC nor the Turkish government indicates the amount of land surface that will be used for construction and be affected by the NPP. Thus, it can be said that this study will help determine this unexplained land use amount by applying RS techniques. | Study area: The Akkuyu NPP study area is located in the province of Mersin in southern Turkey, at the coordinates of 36¬∞08‚Ä≤ N and 33¬∞32‚Ä≤ E (Fig. 
Various studies have stated the reasons why Akkuyu was selected for the first NPP in Turkey. Among these is the fact that Akkuyu is seismically stable and located on the seashore, provides appropriate transportation and cooling water, and is significantly less populated, making it safer in case of any accidents 
According to IAEA's guide (2015), two off-site emergency zones should be established: the first one, namely the precautionary action zone (PAZ), where arrangements are taken in order to ""reduce the risk of severe deterministic health effects before and shortly after the release of any radioactive material,"" and the second one, namely the urgent protective action planning zone (UPZ), where arrangements are taken to ""reduce the negative effects of the radioactive dose.""
The Akkuyu NPP is a category 1 facility and will have four reactors that produce more than 1000 MW. IAEA's guide suggests approximate distances for such reactors (3-5 km for PAZ, 5-30 km for UPZ); however, there is no crystal-clear definition of how to select these distances in the IAEA's guide or the National Radiation Emergency Plan (URAP) prepared by the Turkish Ministry of Interior-Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (2019). Therefore, in order to test the suggested methodology and evaluate the results, a rectangular area with 15 √ó 20 km dimensions, whose center is overlaid with the construction site, is selected for the LULC monitoring. This study area covers the PAZ and UPZ addressed in the IAEA guides, a new highway being constructed nearby the project site, and the new development areas planned in the ELUP near Akkuyu. For NPPs, there is an exclusionary zone which is under effective control of the plant management, and public habitation is prohibited within this zone  | Materials and methods: The goal of this study is to identify LULC changes around the Akkuyu NPP construction site by classifying remotely sensed images. The workflow consists of four steps: selecting the images, classifying the images, accuracy assessment in Google Earth Engine, and LULC change analysis (Fig. 
For image selection and supervised classification, the Google Earth Engine (GEE) was used. GEE is a cloud-based web platform for geospatial tasks. It takes advantage of Google's extensive computational expertise for numerous Earth monitoring activities. The main advantages of GEE are that it provides multi-petabyte data, GIS functionality, built-in RS and machine learning (ML) algorithms, an online code editor and visualization, and cloud processing. The GEE is in charge of many of the issues that arise when it comes to data storage, cataloguing, and projection. Many of the most common RS data sources have been absorbed by GEE  | Data used: The study area was delimitated by uploading a vector file as an input to the GEE. Then, we chose Landsat 8 (L8) atmospherically corrected surface reflectance scenes accessible on the GEE platform for the year 2017 (before construction began) and the year 2021 in order to delineate the LULC change between these 2 years and evaluate the impact of the construction of Akkuyu NPP. These multi-temporal composites were created using the filtered collection by date function (filterDate) on the GEE platform. Both composites cover the summer period between May 1 and September 30, as this is the time of year when different kinds of vegetation are all at a stable stage.
As part of NASA's Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM), the L8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) generates RS data that is consistent with previous Landsat projects. Medium-resolution Landsat datasets allow LULC analyses across long time scales. L8 offers multi-spectral imagery with a 30-m spatial resolution, 5 visible and near-infrared bands, and 2 short-wave infrared bands, with a revisit period of 16 days 
A vital stage in every LULC classification is the preparation of the basis dataset. The compilation of this dataset for the L8 data in this study begins in the GEE with a filtered and cloud-masked image collection. Visible and infrared bands of L8 images, as seen Table  | Classification scheme: The classification scheme is interested in five LULC classes: (1) artificial surfaces, including settlements, lands covered by concrete, and all sorts of built-up areas; (2) agricultural areas, including annual and permanent crops, grasslands, and greenhouses; (3) forests; (4) water bodies, including the sea and streams; and (5) barren lands, including lands having few plants, sandy, and rocky areas.
Satellite image classification aims to automatically classify each pixel into LULC classes. However, supervised image classification requires a priori knowledge of the LULC classes of interest. The selected LULC classes need to be marked on the images for training the supervised classification algorithms. Hence, we collected a total of 2000 randomly distributed pixels throughout both composite images in the GEE environment. This sample set is randomly split into 1400 training pixels (70% of the samples and 280 samples per class) and 600 validation (test) pixels (30% of the samples and 120 samples per class). The training pixels were used for training the classifier, and the remaining validation pixels were used for assessing the performance of the classification. The selection of these pixels was based on a visual approach supported Vol:. ( 
by high-resolution Bing and Google Earth images, L8 NDVI profiles, false color composites, and local LULC maps. The confusion matrix method, which is a widely used approach for comparing classification outputs with validation data, was used to analyze the performance of the classifier. The confusion matrix can be used to derive some specific accuracy measures: overall accuracy (OA, Eq. 1), producer's accuracy (PA, Eq. 2), and user's accuracy (UA, Eq. 3). The OA corresponds to the total efficacy of the classifier. The PA (also known as recall) can be defined as the power of the algorithm to detect positive labels. The UA (also known as precision) gives the consistency between the input and the positive labels detected by the algorithm. When a classifier achieves a high recall and precision value, it is considered very accurate. High precision (UA) corresponds to a low number of commission errors, while high recall (PA) leads to a low number of omission errors in the LULC classification.
(1) | OA =: The number of correctly classified samples The total number of samples The last metric we used is Cohen's kappa coefficient (Eq. 4). Cohen's kappa is a common statistic for determining how well the predicted and observed classes agree, calculated as follows:
where p 0 is the relative observed agreement in the classifier, and p e is the hypothesized probability of change agreement. It basically tells how much better the classifier performs than a classifier that predicts randomly based on the class frequency. The Cohen's kappa coefficient is always less than or equal to one. A number of 0 indicates no agreement, 0.21-0.40 is reasonable, 0.41-0.60 is moderate, 0.61-0.80 is considerable, and 0.81-1 is nearly faultless agreement.
The classifier package of GEE administers supervised image classification by so-called ML algorithms. These ML classifiers are SVM, CART, Na√Øve Bayes, gradient tree boost, and RF. We used the RF classifier to accomplish our LULC classification task. So far, RF is one of the most commonly used ML classifiers for LULC classification using remote sensing data. The RF classifier handles outliers and noisier datasets as well as it has shown good performance with high dimensional input data  | LULC mapping and change detection: The LULC maps of the study area were produced using the RF classification approach for two different Landsat composites. In order to assess the LULC (2) PA =

change between the years 2017 and 2021, the postclassification method was implemented to compare the LULC at these different times after two independent image classifications. Therefore, LULC change can be detected using two classified images by computing a matrix of change without the serious impact of atmospheric and environmental differences between the acquisition dates  | Results: A total of 2000 pixels were captured across the 5 classes in both image composites, resulting in 1400 training data pixels and 600 validation data pixels.

to 77-100% in 2021. Moreover, class-specific PA ranged from 78-100% for 2017 to 82-100% for 2021. Water bodies appeared to be the most accurately predicted, with UA and PA of 100% in both images. Agricultural areas were least accurately classified in the image of 2017 with UA and PA of 83% and 78%, respectively. Barren lands were the least accurate class in the image of 2021 with UA and PA of 77% and 82%, respectively.

Changes in each LULC class from 2017 to 2021 are shown in Fig.  | Discussions: LULC mapping and change detection analysis have generally been time-consuming and labor-intensive operations, and they are one of the primary research issues in RS applications. Recent developments in RS, along with the availability of open access data, have produced data that may be utilized for a variety of environmental monitoring applications. The GEE is becoming a more prominent tool for extracting and classifying open-access satellite imagery. Here, we presented a case study to quantify regional LULC change using GEE and Landsat satellite observations. This study supports the use of GEE to collect the imagery data easily and implement classification procedures with GEE's built-in functions. We used the RF algorithm to classify LULC classes using 1400 training and 600 validation pixels for two composite images, and the performance of the classification was good enough to generate the LULC maps (with kappa scores of more than 0.88). In this respect, we created LULC maps for the Akkuyu region near an NPP construction site for the years 2017 and 2021, demonstrating that the LULC in the region has altered drastically Vol:. ( 
over the study period. The results indicated that the area covered by artificial surfaces showed an increasing trend during the study period.
According to the quantitative results of the LULC mapping with the RS approach, the natural land cover has been lost, while built-up areas (larger roads, new development areas) have significantly increased since the beginning of the construction of the Akkuyu NPP. The increase in roads might have direct effects on habitats and ecosystems and fragment natural land cover 
Even though NPPs may occupy a small amount of land, they can have far-reaching landscape effects 
Expected policy outcomes should be to limit new development that may attract migration and keep the population density under a certain level around an NPP. However, the increase in artificial surfaces addresses new development areas and roads around rural villages. The authorities should preserve the rural characteristics of the region in order to enable rural communities to sustain their productivity. On the other hand, as Nero et al.   Nonetheless, according to our quantitative analysis, the new NPP construction seems to accelerate urbanization in the area. As Aydƒ±n (2020) states, since the need for the service sector has increased with the increase in the population, the number of people coming to this region to work has also increased. The increase in the population and number of residences around NPPs show us that the people in this region do not see NPPs as a risk and do not refrain from living around them. A similar finding was found by 
The CEO of the APC states that the Akkuyu NPP is going to be the largest nuclear energy production site in the world and it will become fully operational by 2026 (World Nuclear News, 2021a). Even though the IAEA found that Turkish institutions and the APC implemented an adequate and satisfactory framework for nuclear security (World Nuclear News, 2021b), the Akkuyu Project will cause more people to accumulate in the study area and to live there permanently. However, there is no clear policy on how to protect the new settlements and how to evacuate the people living there in the event of a possible emergency. Thanks to this study, it is seen that the project site and the surrounding areas were opened to settlements in an uncontrolled manner and lost their natural characteristics. The ELUP supports this urban sprawl in the region. This plan does not contain any action, idea, or thought regarding the protection of natural habitats around the NPP. Turkey needs to review its land use and population density control policies and implement land use plans in line with the standards. This revision should be made for both the first NPP in Akkuyu and the other two NPP projects Turkey plans to build in the future.
This study highlights the importance of monitoring LULC changes around NPPs and recommends the use of satellite images in this regard. The LULC monitoring using satellite images gave valuable information to manage the post-disaster LULC changes after the Fukushima Daiichi NPP disaster 
Certainly, this study has some limitations. Firstly, this study neither covers natural hazard scenarios nor physical or cyber security of the Akkuyu NPP. Some recent studies clarified these issues  | Conclusions: LULC change analysis of the construction site and its surroundings of the Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant project in southern Turkey was undertaken in this case study, which was supported by remotely sensed Landsat 8 images. Five LULC classes (agricultural lands, artificial surfaces, barren lands, water bodies, and forests) were selected for the classification of satellite images on the study site. The composite images compiled in Vol.: (0123456789) 2017 for the period before the construction of the project and the composite image compiled for 2021 reflecting the recent past were prepared on the Google Earth Engine platform, which enables easy management of open-access satellite images. For both images, 2000 sample pixels belonging to five LULC classes were created. Seventy percent of these sample pixels were used to train the classifier model, and the remaining 30% were used to assess the performance of the model. The Random Forest algorithm, which has given very successful results in the remote sensing literature, was used as the classifier model. As a result of training and validating the model, high classification performance was obtained for both images (kappa > 0.88). After the classification process, LULC maps for the years 2017 and 2021 were generated. In order to understand the LULC change between these two maps, statistical calculations for the LULC change were computed using the Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin on QGIS. While making these LULC change computations, both the entire study area (15 √ó 25 km) and a buffer zone with a radius of 1 km, which is the heart of the NPP construction, were taken into consideration. From 2017 to 2021 in the whole study area, the artificial surface class saw the greatest rise (78.46%), whereas forests (-8.31%) and barren lands experienced considerable decreases (-6.11%). When the 1 km buffer perimeter of the power plant was examined, it was determined that the LULC change followed a distinct trend, with artificial surfaces increasing greatly (113.94%), while the regions covered by forests and barren lands fell dramatically 
As a result of this analysis, it was determined that in the last 4 years, built-up areas in the close vicinity of the Akkuyu NPP construction had increased, the forest areas had been severely damaged, the sea areas had been filled to a certain extent, and the agricultural lands had not been significantly affected. The figures and tables provided throughout the study show how the LULC classes have evolved on the construction site and in the region. The construction of the Akkuyu NPP has caused a serious LULC conversion in its immediate vicinity. The main concern of this article is to examine the potential LULC change and population growth that this project will create in the region. Such analyses need to be sustained until the Akkuyu NPP is fully operational, with more ground-truthing and perhaps with different datasets with better spatial resolution. However, the construction site is restricted to the public and researchers, and the extent of the construction site is still unknown.
The number of studies conducted on the monitoring of population density and land use around NPPs is very limited. At the same time, few studies have been conducted on operating power plants. In countries that do not have experience in nuclear energy production, such as Turkey, it is important to research on this subject, to ensure that the country in question can monitor the environmental and social indicators around NPPs and determine how ready it is for possible emergency scenarios in accordance with the literature and international documents.","Multicriteria decision analysis based on analytic hierarchy process in GIS environment for siting nuclear power plant in Egypt (, , , 2015. 2014) || Land use and land cover dynamics with special emphasis on shifting cultivation in Eastern Ghats Highlands of India using remote sensing data and GIS (, , , , , , , , , 2019) || The history of greenhouse gas emissions and relation with the nuclear energy policy for Turkey (, , , , 2019) || Urban change analysis and future growth of Istanbul (, , , 2015) || Considerations on the land management system approach in Turkey by the experiences of a case study (, , 2019) || Nuclear energy debate in Turkey: Stakeholders, policy alternatives, and governance issues (, 2020.

"Land use and land cover change detection and prediction in Bhutan's high altitude city of Thimphu, using cellular automata and Markov chain",Sonam Wang; Lamchin Munkhnasan; Woo-Kyun Lee,"Rapid urbanization is changing landscapes often resulting in the degradation of ecosystem services and quality of urban life. Remote sensing and GIS tools can provide valuable information to deepen our understanding of the dynamics of these changes to better plan and build sustainable cities for the future. Using remote sensing data, socio-economic data, and field observations, we simulated spatiotemporal dynamics of land use and land cover changes in the city of Thimphu. Simulation results reveal that the landscape of Thimphu city has changed considerably during the study period and the change trend is predicted to continue into 2050. The study observed a significant increase (12.77%) in built-up area from 2002 (52.88%) to 2018 (65.5%), followed by a slight increase in the cover of bare ground. On the contrary, forest cover declined drastically (15.25%) followed by agriculture (1.01%). Rapid population growth triggered by rural urban migration coupled with hasty socio-economic development post democracy are the main drivers of these changes. These changes have fragmentated forest cover, increased soil/gully erosion, surface runoff, and storm induced floods of storm and sanitation drains, thereby impinging on the overall quality of life in the city. Under the business as usual scenario, prediction analysis for the year 2050 show that built up area will consume almost all of the city area (73.21%) with forest significantly reduced to patches making up only about 16% of the city. These findings beg for an urgent need to implement effective planning specially to protect the existing forest and water resources from further degradation.","Introduction: Global cities, which are the engines of economic development 
These studies have generated highly credible information on the state of land use changes and their drivers, which can inform better decision making for sustainable planning of cities 
The Kingdom of Bhutan is located in the rugged landscape of the eastern Himalayas between 88 Àö54' and 92 Àö10 
The impact of LULC changes are more serious in the cities than other areas mainly due to pressures from population, developmental programs, and rate of urbanization  | Methodology:  | Study area: Thimphu city, the capital of Bhutan is the crucible of socio-economic, political, and environmental development in the country. Administratively, the city is composed of central core, southern extension, and northern extension. Geographically, the city is located at 27 Àö29'N latitude and 89 Àö36'E longitude between an elevation of about 2347-2438 m amsl 
With over 15.75% (114,551) of Bhutan's entire population (727,145) living in Thimphu, it is the most populated of all the cities of Bhutan  | Land policy and regime changes: Historically, Thimphu city started in 1961 with some 25 shops or so which currently falls within the central core of the city. Prior to this, the area was occupied by terraced agricultural fields and some 13 villages. Planned development for Thimphu started in 1985 with the establishment of National Urban Development Commission. Since then, two major policy interventions have expediated the growth of the city thereby changing its LULC: Source: (Source: http://glovis.usgs.gov ) (i) Approval of city extension : Government approval of the comprehensive structural plan for Thimphu city in 2002, approved the expansion of the core area towards the south and north  | Data acquisitions and preparation: Methodological framework of the simulation has been illustrated in Fig. 
These data sets were imported into TerrSet satellite image processing software to create a false color composite. Other geospatial data collected from Thimphu city office include, digital elevation model (DEM 30 m resolution), administrative boundaries, and infrastructure data such as road networks, drainage networks, water bodies, buildings, and other important establishments in the city. Additionally, field consultations with select communities, experts, and planners from the city office The years 2002 and 2018 were selected to correspond to major sociopolitical and policy changes in Bhutan that has significant bearings on LULC in the city. Expansion of Thimphu city in 2002 added local areas of Lanjophaka, Heo-Samteling, Jungshi-Pamtsho, Taba and Dechencholing in the north and Changjiji, Lungtenphu, Simtokha, and Babesa in the south ( Fig.  | Pre-processing and classification: Pre-processing is an important step to establish direct affiliation between the acquired data and biophysical phenomenon. Remotely sensed data are susceptible to radiance, geometric, and atmospheric distortions due to acquisition systems and platform movements. One major function of pre-processing is to remove such distortions especially when optical sensor data is used. Atmospheric correction involves removal of haze primarily originating from water vapor, fog, dust, smoke, or other particles in the atmosphere 
Visual interpretation was also used to resolve any issues related to mixed pixels and enhance classification accuracy.
The outputs were then subjected to supervised classification using the Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC). MLC classifier was used as it is a robust and popular algorithm increasingly used for classification of LULC  | Assessment of classification accuracy: Assessment of classification accuracy is a prerequisite for classification data to credibly detect changes 
Where, i is the class number, n is the total number of classified pixels that are being compared to actual data, n ii is the number of pixels belonging to the actual data class i , that were classified with a class i, C i is the total number of classified pixels belonging to class i and G i is the total number of actual data pixels belonging to class i .
In order to deepen the understanding of major land uses and drivers of their changes and socio-environmental implications, the principal investigator carried out field visits in 2019. During the field visits, field observations and consultations were held with the stakeholders including communities, experts and local officials to collect biophysical and climatic data. Discussions were also held to acquire information about urban expansion, evolution of land use, possible reasons for the observed changes and resident perception on socio-environmental resilience. In addition, records of major incidents such as disasters (fire, floods), plantation efforts, policy changes, etc. were also noted. These information and firsthand experience from the field were used to further validate the classified images. | Land use and land cover change analysis: CA-Markov is a robust model that has outperformed other methods for simulating and predicting LULC types  | Markov chain analysis: The Markov model simulated changes in LULC from one time to another in order to predict future change. Markov chain analysis built in module at TerrSet was used to generate transition probability matrix (where the probabilities of transition represent the probability that a pixel of a given class will move to some other cell class in the next time period) and transition area matrix (which represents the total area (in cells) expected to change from one LULC class to another over the prescribed number of time units). The transition probability matrix is expressed in a text file that records the likelihood of moving each land use and land cover category to some other category, while the transition area matrix, also represented in a text file records the number of pixels required to transition from one land use and land cover class to another over the specified number of time unit ( Fig. 
The Markovian chain analysis is represented as, S(t,t + 1) = Pij √ó S(t) , where, S(t) is the system status at time of t, S(t + 1) is the system status at time t + 1; Pij is the transition probability matrix in a state, which is calculated using the following formula 
where, ùúå is the Markov probability matrix, and ùúå ùëñùëó stands for the probability of converting from current state i to another state j in next time period. Low transition will have a probability near (0) and high transition probability near (1). The 2002 LULC image of the Thimphu city was used as the base ( t 1 ) image while 2018 LULC map as the later ( t 2 ) image in this model to obtain the transition matrix between 2002 and 2018. In this study, ArcGIS cross-tabulation functionality was used to generate transitional area matrices by multiplying each column in the transition probability matrix by the number of pixels of corresponding class in the later image. | Transitional suitability maps: Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) was used to build transition suitability maps which show the probability of a pixel to change to another class or remain unchanged. MCE integrates various driving factors to derive a single index of evaluation  | The CA-Markov model: The transition probability matrix and transition area matrix from 2002 to 2018 calculated in Markov chain analysis. The area of each land class to be converted to another LULC classes was estimated based on the transition probabilities. These areas were divided by the total number of iterations (16 years) for the cellular automation to generate the areas to be converted per iteration. We applied a contiguity filter of 5 √ó 5 pixels to define the effect of neighboring cells on the central cell. The future assignment to a specific LULC class for each pixel was based on how much the pixel is suitable for that LULC class and how close the pixel is to other pixels of the same class. The new policy and political developments after 2001 and 2008 were assumed as in simulating future scenarios. The period, 2002-2018 represents a rapid expansion of the city accompanied by expediated socio-economic development that led to significant changes in the city's landscape. Assuming that these probabilities  | Results and discussion:  | Classification accuracy: Model validation is an important precondition for studies that attempt to predict LULC changes  | Analysis of land use and land cover types: LULC analysis allows us to understand biophysical changes such as: loss of productive ecosystems/biodiversity, deterioration of environmental quality, loss of forest and agricultural lands what are important information for planning sustainable cities 
Our study applied latest remote sensing and GIS techniques to quantify LULC in Thimphu city. Using the outputs from remote sensing imagery, field surveys, and topped expert knowledge of the study area, five LULC types were classified; water body, bare ground, built-up area, forest, and agriculture ( Fig. 
These expediated changes can be attributed to: i) governments approval for expansion of the city in 2002, followed by the hastened construction of city infrastructure post Bhutan's transition to democracy in 2008. The resultant improvement in basic facilities combined with creation of additional jobs further attracted more immigration from rural areas and lesser developed cities, causing a boom in real estate and informal settlements and triggering significant changes in land uses.
Studies by  | LULC transition between years: To deepen our understanding of the evolving nature of the LULC types in the city, we created confusion matrices for changes in 2002 and 2018 ( Table 
The potential for these trends to continue remain high with transition probabilities of 0.83 for bare ground and 0.58 for forest to transition to built-up area. Although small, agriculture land shows a significant probability to transition to built-up area which has been the trend in many cities 
The findings indicate that rapid development of urban built will lead to sharp declines in forest and agriculture and increase in urban population. These developments could jeopardize ecosystem health, human well-being, and food security  | Prediction of land use land cover change: Results of LULC prediction using CA-Markov analysis are shown in Table  | Conclusion: This study represents a first ever attempt to simulate the process of land use dynamics and the effects of physical, demographic, and socioeconomic driving forces on LULC in Bhutan's capital city of Thimphu using remote sensing and GIS technology. Results clearly confirm significant changes in LULC from the start of expansion to current area in 2002 to 2018. Significant increase in built-up areas were associated with parallel loss of important land cover types such as forest and agriculture. Significant changes in Thimphu's landscapes are correlated with the government's decision to expand the city northwards and southwards. This expansion received a boost after the institution of constitutional democracy in 2008 which brought in expediated development in the city. These two policy events topped with rapid population growth mainly from rural urban migration for better opportunities and development activities expediated the LULC changes in the city. Combined these factors have reduced and fragmented forest cover which will degrade ecosystem services that are vital for maintaining the quality of human wellbeing in the city. Reports from the city residents also confirm that the impacts of these changes especially in the face of climate change are disproportionately felt by the most vulnerable groups such as low income, women, and children. The results of prediction for 2050 also did not bear well for Thimphu city, with forest cover diminishing to a mere 4.28km 2 (16.32%) which are also highly fragmented. Loss of forest cover will degrade important ecological services and increase vulnerability of the city to landslides, gulley erosion, drying of water sources, worsened air pollution, and loss of important biodiversity. More studies are recommended to especially monitor the impact of these changes and identify adaptive and mitigative interventions for a more sustainable city.
Study also show that remote sensing and GIS are effective tools for simulating urban changes, which are useful for guiding urban planning and management. The findings of this study are useful to policy makers, urban planners, and citizens to adopt better environmental management practices including adaptation and mitigation strategies for the city and its surrounding areas. The study recommend an ecosystem based adaptation policies and other legal frameworks should be developed and practically implemented to protect the current forest cover as well as rehabilitate and improve the existing green spaces in and around the urban centers. Such efforts must focus on planting fruit trees in urban spaces such as parking lots, between buildings, back yards, and along roads. These will significantly, increase water retention, protect soil from ero-sion, host biodiversity, as well as regulate temperature and pollution. Current capacities of storm drains and water reservoirs must also be enhanced. Informal settlements must either be formalized by providing all basic facilities or moved to formal settlements. We also caution the city to restrain from land filling flood plains and use the claimed land for building infrastructure as these areas are not only prone to flooding especially global lake outburst floods but also important for biodiversity. We encourage the city planners and experts to use the findings and recommendations from our study to avert irreversible changes to its LULC.
The accuracy of the classification results was not perfect due to the hilly nature of the study area, where ground changes in altitude can impact the image pixel value. However, it is significant and as such study findings and recommendations can be applied to other cities in Bhutan and other mountainous countries which share similar ecological and socioeconomic characteristics. | Declaration of Competing Interests: Authors have no competing interests.","Urban and Peri-urban agriculture in developing countries studied using remote sensing and in situ methods (, 2010) || Predicting land cover using GIS, Bayesian and evolutionary algorithm methods (, , 2009) || Application of geo-information techniques in land use and land cover change analysis in a peri-urban district of Ghana (, , , , 2015) || Analysis and modelling of urban land cover change in Setubal and sesimbra (, , 2010) || Biodiversity hotspot of Bhutan and its sustainability (, , 2016) || Can engaging local people' interest reduce forest degradation in Central Vietnam?

"Detection of land use/land cover changes in a watershed: A case study of the Murredu watershed in Telangana state, India",Padala Raja; Aneesh Mathew,"Land-use change refers to a change in how a particular area of land is utilised or managed by humans. Land-cover change refers to a change in some continuous features of the land, such as vegetation type, soil conditions, and so on. For the purpose of identifying change-vulnerable areas and creating sustainable ecosystem services, mapping and quantifying the state of land use/land cover (LULC) changes and change-causing factors are crucial. The present research utilizes a geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) techniques to categorise and identify changes in a Murredu watershed in Telangana state, India, between 1996 and 2019. Five major LULC categories (agricultural land, forest, barren land, built-up area, and waterbodies) from satellite images of 1996 to 2019 were mapped. The maximum likelihood approach was used to supervise the classification process, and high-resolution Google Earth Pro was used to evaluate the accuracy of the classified map. The accuracy of the mapping was evaluated using the error matrix and Kappa statistics. Overall classification accuracy for the classified image of 2019 was found to be 90 % with overall kappa statistics of 85.98%. From these findings, change detection analysis shows that the area used for agricultural land, barren land, forest, built-up areas, and waterbodies has increased by 5.17%, 3.39%, 0.84%, and 0.26%, respectively, between 1996 and 2019. The forest area has decreased by 9.67% at the same time. Therefore, this research anticipates that the findings might provide information to planners, land managers, and decision-makers for the sustainable management and development of the natural resource.","Introduction: The term ''land-use"" describes how humans use the land cover to support themselves. It covered both the methods and motivations used to change the biophysical characteristics of the land. Crop cultivation, mining, housing, and infrastructure development are a few examples of land use 
The hydrological and geomorphological processes and features of a river system, as well as their interactions, variability, and spatial distribution, are described by river hydro-morphology 
Finding differences in a phenomenon's status by watching it at various periods is the method of ''change detection"" 
Assessment of LULC change aids in determining the degree of human impact over the environment. Numerous academics believed it to be a significant process that has local, regional, and worldwide effects on both natural environments and socioeconomic conditions 
Due to its recurring data collecting, precise georeferencing processes, and digital format suited for computer processing, satellite remote sensing is the most popular data source for the quantification, identification, and mapping of LULC forms and variations 
There are several satellite programmes running right now. The Landsat programme is exceptional for change detection research because it offers a historical and ongoing archive of imagery 
In the watershed, biological circumstances, gradients, and elevations play a significant role in determining land use/land cover. In addition to the aforementioned variables, technological, socioeconomic, and institutional setup are also anticipated to have an impact on the LULC change 
In the present work, the changing pattern of LULC in the Murredu watershed from 1996 to 2019 has been mapped using multitemporal satellite images from Landsat-5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI/ TIRS imagery. The main objective of the current study was to utilise GIS and RS applications to find out the extent of changes occurring in the Murredu Watershed. However, the specific objectives were to: utilize SRTM-DEM to delineate the Murredu basin's watershed; and, furthermore, detect LULC changes in the Murredu watershed between 1996 and 2019. | Study area: The current investigation was carried out in the Telangana state of India's Murredu watershed (Fig.  | Data acquisition: The SRTM-DEM data, collected and was utilized to generate watershed boundary of the Murredu basin. For the purpose of visual image interpretation and identifying LULC change, satellite data comprised of multi-spectral data collected by the Landsat satellite and made available by the USGS Earth Explorer (https:// earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) were utilised (Table 
The Landsat-8 image acquired in 2019 is part of the utilised satellite dataset. Launched on 2013, the Landsat-8 satellite sensor has two sensors: a thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) and an operational land imager (OLI). Landsat-8 satellite information consist of eleven bands with a spatial resolution of 30 m for bands 1 through 9. For bands 10 as well as 11, the spatial resolution is 100 m. In the panchromatic band (band 8), which has a spatial resolution of 15 m. Bands 1 to 7 coastal, blue, green, red, nearinfrared, shortwave infrared I, and shortwave infrared II were chosen for examination in this study since bands 8 to 11 are less frequently employed in LULC classification (https://www. usgs.gov/media/images/landsat-8-band-designations).
On the other hand, the satellite dataset used includes the 1996 Landsat-5 image. Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) level 1 records were acquired in 1996; the mission was launched on 1984. Each of the seven bands of the Landsat-5 satellite data has a spatial resolution of 30 m. Thermal band 6 has a 120 m spatial resolution. Visible (bands 1 to 3), near-infrared, and mid-infrared are included (https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-5). It was difficult to choose images from the same date across the entire study period. Additionally, LULC class ground truth data were used. This information was gathered as reference data points for 2019 image analysis utilising the Google Earth Pro, and it was utilised to classify images and evaluate the classification results' overall accuracy. | Data preparation for watershed delineation: The highest sensitivity zones may be extrapolated using DEMs, which are based on watershed realisation utilising the computational watershed application of Spatial Analyst tools  | Methodology: Fig.  | Pre-processing: Prior to change detection, pre-processing of satellite images is crucial and has the specific objective of creating a more direct connection between biophysical processes and information  | Land-cover classification scheme: A classification scheme that specifies the LULC classes was taken into consideration when creating the LULC map from satellite imagery. The ideal number of LULC classes depends on the specifications of a particular project for a particular application. For mapping the entire watershed region, the five key LULC classifications of built-up area, agricultural land, forest, barren land, and waterbodies were selected (Table  | Post-processing: Delimiting polygons around typical sites allowed training samples to be chosen for each of the specified LULC types. The spectral signatures for the various land cover categories seen in the satellite images were determined using the pixels contained in these polygons. Confusion among them to be mapped land covers is assessed  to be minimal when a spectral signature is deemed to be satisfactory 
A Google Earth Pro examination has been conducted. To carry out supervised classifications, choose a training site, and assess classification accuracy, ground truth data should be collected. The Google Earth Pro was used to gather training and testing interest sites for the ground truth information in this investigation. The current research area classes were defined after interpretation and five LULC classes (built-up area, agricultural land, forest, barren land, and water-bodies) were identified because the google earth pro image has a high spatial resolution. | LULC change detection: The LULC mapping project was expected to produce data on the spatial distribution of land use categories, as well as identify and estimate changes in land use over the previous decades. Furthermore, the number of transitions from one land cover category to another between time periods (1996 and 2019) was quantified. Important information about the spatial distribution of LULC changes is presented by the change matrix  | Accuracy assessment: The comparison of a classification with actual data serves as an accuracy assessment, which determines how accurately the classification captures the real world. Using a random sampling   Settlements, artificial infrastructure, transportation and so on Agricultural Crop fields and fallow lands approach with 200 points, an accuracy assessment of the classified images that resulted in this study was done to examine the quality of the information that was produced from the data. The error matrix was used to conduct this evaluation. To assess the degree of classification accuracy from the report portion of ERDAS Imagine 2015, Kappa statistics and the overall accuracy of the categorised images were conducted. | Results:  | Murredu watershed: This river's watershed covers 1593 km 2 in total (Fig.  | LULC scenario of Murredu watershed, 1996: Agriculture accounted for 54.19 percent of the watershed's land area in 1996. Forest (40.30 %) was the watershed's second most prevalent land cover. Because a forest infiltrates the majority of the rain that falls during the monsoon and reduces both soil erosion and surface runoff, it often plays a significant influence in the hydrological features of a watershed. In low land watersheds, it will also lessen flood intensity  | LULC scenario of Murredu watershed, 2019: After 1996, there was a significant amount of deforestation in the watershed region, which left the land unforested and suitable for agriculture and other uses. The majority of the watershed's land was used for agriculture in 2019 (59.36 %). Forest (30.63 %) was the second most prevalent land cover in the watershed. As shown in Fig. 
Forests are recognised for promoting groundwater recharge and consuming a lot of water through evapotranspiration from the trees  | Accuracy assessment: One of the significant differences between the classified image and the actual or real ground is accuracy evaluation. The accuracy of the 2019 classified map was evaluated using one of the most popular Kappa accuracy assessment techniques. Using highresolution satellite images from Google Earth Pro, 200 stratified random points were generated (Table  | Conclusion: This present study demonstrates how LULC changes in the Murredu drainage basin have altered significantly over the past decades. Overall classification accuracy for the classified image of 2019 was found to be 90 % with overall kappa statistics of 85.98 %. From these findings, change detection analysis shows that the area used for agricultural land, barren land, forest, built-up areas, and waterbodies has increased by 5.17 %, 3.39 %, 0.84 %, and 0.26 %, respectively, between 1996 and 2019. The forest area has decreased by 9.67 % at the same time. The area of forest has decreased, whereas the areas for agriculture, waterbodies, bare land, and built-up areas have all increased. Therefore, this research anticipates that the findings might provide information to planners, land managers, and decision-makers for the sustainable management and development of the natural resource. In a future study, sub-watersheds could be created within the watershed since it is large enough to be included in management practices. Additionally, these sub-watersheds could be given higher priority for management and conservation based on the degree of deterioration.

"This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal. Content is final as presented, with the exception of pagination",Sunan Shi; Yanfei Zhong; Ji Zhao; Pengyuan Lv; Yinhe Liu; Liangpei Zhang,"High spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images can reflect more subtle changes and more specific types of land use and land cover (LULC) due to the abundant spatial geometric information. In this article, a class-prior object-oriented conditional random field (COCRF) framework consisting of a binary change detection (CD) task and a multiclass CD task is proposed to fill the application gap. In the proposed framework, the class-prior knowledge is used to improve the construction of the unary potential in both the binary and multiclass CD tasks, to reduce the influence of spectral variability. The binary CD result provides a constraint to the multiclass CD result. As a result, both parts have effective interaction.
The class posterior probability images of two dates can be obtained automatically with the class-prior knowledge by sample migration. Furthermore, an object constraint described by the class dispersion within the objects is added to improve the smoothness in local objects, while the pairwise potential improves the smoothness of the whole area by using the eight-neighborhood spectral information of the center pixel. By integrating the above approaches, the problems of error accumulation and the manual intervention required in the traditional multiclass CD methods can be relieved. An adaptive parameter estimation strategy is also adopted in the proposed framework, to save the time required for manual parameter setting. The proposed COCRF framework was validated on two HSR remote sensing image data sets, where it achieved a better performance than the other state-of-the-art CD methods.","I. INTRODUCTION: C HANGE detection (CD) is aimed at identifying changes on the ground by analyzing multitemporal remote sensing images taken in the same geographical area at different dates 
Classical CD methods such as image differencing 
Object-based image analysis using spatial and spectral information is attracting more and more attention and has demonstrated great potential in image processing research 
As a consequence, many supervised DC methods based on prior data have been proposed to obtain multiclass CD results. Examples of such methods are direct classification relying on stacked multitemporal images 
What is more, for most OBCD methods, there are basically two kinds of segmentation strategies for the object-level information 
Aiming at this drawback, random field models, such as Markov random field (MRF) and conditional random field (CRF) models, are other popular ways to model the spatial information, in addition to the OBCD methods. MRF was first used for image processing in 1984 
Therefore, in this article, the class-prior object-oriented CRF (COCRF) framework consisting of a binary CD task and a multiclass CD task is proposed for HSR remote sensing imagery. The fuzzy object constraint improves the spatial-contextual learning ability, relative to the traditional CRF model. Furthermore, a semi-labeled class map is used as the prior knowledge to explore the class posterior probabilities of the two registered images so that the ""from-to"" change information can be estimated and the final CD result can show abundant change direction information. The main novel contributions of the COCRF framework are as follows.
1) The COCRF framework combining the binary and multiclass CD tasks is proposed. The unary potentials are differently constructed for the two tasks, while the pairwise potential and the object constraint of the proposed object-oriented CRF model are the same. The COCRF framework optimizes the binary CD task before the multiclass CD task. The binary CD task is constrained by the multiclass information through a similarity measurement of the class posterior probabilities, to decrease the inaccuracy caused by the use of only the spectral difference or the DC of class labels. The binary CD result provides a mask constraint when computing the ""from-to"" probability, so that only the changed areas are considered in the multiclass CD task. Furthermore, a joint optimization strategy based on task fusion in the unary potential of the object-oriented CRF model is also considered to generate a more lightweight framework. 2) To address the shortcoming of too much manual work being required in the supervised multiclass CD task, only a semi-labeled class map (the so-called ""class prior"") of one date is needed in the proposed framework. Aiming at situations without sufficient historical data, we can label part of the image or even just the unchanged area. The sample migration can then be realized because the LULC classes should be the same in the unchanged areas. The class posterior probabilities are then obtained and shared in both tasks to improve the robustness of the final results. The parameters in most of the CRF models are set empirically, which require a lot of manual work. Therefore, an adaptive parameter estimation strategy is adopted in the proposed framework to reduce the run time. 3) To make full use of the spatial information and geographic structure of HSR images and take advantage of pixel interaction at the object level, an object constraint is incorporated into the pairwise CRF model. By analyzing the class dispersion degree within a single object, the strength of the object constraint is determined. The object constraint can reduce the impact of segmentation boundary errors to make the boundaries of the final results smoother and decrease the influence of the internal spectral variability of the objects. The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section II details the proposed COCRF framework. Section III presents an alternative fusion strategy for the binary and multiclass CD tasks. Section IV gives a brief description of the study areas and the experimental results. A sensitivity analysis is presented in Section V. Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section VI. | II. PROPOSED CLASS-PRIOR OBJECT-ORIENTED CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELD FRAMEWORK: The COCRF framework combining class-prior knowledge and an object constraint is proposed for HSR remote sensing imagery, to perform the binary and multiclass CD tasks. The CRF model is the core of the proposed framework, because it is a relatively mature model in the field of image classification and binary CD, and is suitable for the multiclass CD task with LULC classes. However, there is a difference between the unary potentials of CRF for the classification and binary CD tasks, which requires us to establish the unary potentials specifically for the binary and multiclass changes. The pairwise potential and the object constraint of the proposed objectoriented CRF model are same for the two tasks.
The COCRF framework optimizes the binary and multiclass CD tasks by constructing a mutual constraint of the two tasks on the data flow. As shown in Fig. 
The data preparation for the COCRF framework consists of sample migration and the acquisition of observations and class posterior probabilities. The sample migration is conducted in unchanged areas because these LULC classes should be the same between the two dates. With the shared class labels acquired by sample migration, the class posterior probability images (P T 1 and P T 2 ) for the two dates can be computed by any supervised classifier. The spectral difference map (x SD ) and segmentation map (x SM ) are separately obtained by the image differencing and the segmentation. With the prepared data, the similarity and the change direction of each pixel between the two dates can be estimated.
In order to obtain a binary CD result and a multiclass CD result, the unary potentials for the two tasks are generated separately to better illustrate the binary or multiclass changes. A clustering algorithm such as the fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm is used to obtain the change probability as the unary potential for the binary CD task. The unary potential of the multiclass CD task is the ""from-to"" probability estimated by the product of the class posterior probabilities. We do not adopt the PCC method but rather a direct classification strategy based on the ""from-to"" probability because the classification errors can be largely eliminated in this way.
The pairwise potential is modeled using an Ising model to consider the contextual information of both the observed and labeled fields. The loopy belief propagation (LBP) algorithm is used to deduce the final results. The spatial information learned by the traditional pairwise potential is limited for HSR images, so the homogeneity at larger or even different scales is considered by adding an object constraint which is suitable for both the binary and multiclass tasks at the same time. The pairwise potential, object constraint, and inference are all the same for the two tasks. Based on the COCRF framework, both binary and multiclass CD results with a low FA rate can be acquired. | A. Object-Oriented CRF Change Detection Model: CRF is a widely used discriminative probabilistic graphical model that is aimed at modeling the spatial relationship among pixels by the edge connection between neighborhoods 
where Z (x) = y exp{-l‚ààL œà l (x, y l )} is the partition function, which is a normalization factor, and œà l (x, y l ) denotes the potential function, such as a unary potential, pairwise potential, or even higher order potential functions. L represents the set of all the cliques.
The pairwise CRF model is commonly used for image processing due to its convenience in modeling and inference. The local discriminative information of each pixel is described by the unary potential, while the pairwise potential considers the spatial-contextual information of both the labeled and observed fields. Thus, the pairwise CRF model is described as follows:
where œï i is the unary potential term. œÜ i j is the pairwise potential, which focuses on the interaction of the neighborhood pixels defined by Œ∑ i . Z (x) is the partition function.
The traditional pairwise CRF model is realized at the pixel level; however, the spatial learning ability is not deep enough for HSR images because the shape and size of different objects do vary greatly. In contrast, the OBCD methods can utilize the spatial information from a broader horizon or even different scales. In order to explore more spatial information while avoiding the negative influence of wrong segmentation boundaries, higher order CRF has been proposed and has achieved good performances at the object level by designing higher order potentials 
The proposed COCRF framework can be written as
where Œæ s is the additional object constraint varying with the class dispersion within objects. The weights of the neighborhood term and object constraint are controlled by two positive coefficients Œª and Œ≤ to adapt to different data sets. | B. Unary Potential: The unary potential represents the probability of a single pixel taking a particular label. For the binary CD task, it is always formulated by soft clustering methods in unsupervised strategies, while for the classification task, supervised methods are always adopted. In order to describe the binary and multiclass changes effectively, the unary potentials are separately constructed for the binary and multiclass tasks. The class posterior probabilities are first obtained and shared in both tasks to improve the robustness. | 1) Class Posterior Probabilities of Two Dates Obtained by the Support Vector Machine Algorithm:: The input data of the proposed framework are remote sensing images of two dates and a semilabeled map corresponding to one of the dates. Due to the lack of changed samples, supervised CD approaches are difficult to implement. In order to make the prior knowledge fully serve the CD task, the class posterior probabilities of the two dates obtained by sample migration and support vector machine (SVM) are used to construct the unary potentials of both tasks. The unchanged areas have the same LULC classes on both dates, so the sample migration focuses more on the purity of the extracted unchanged area than its integrity. The traditional unsupervised CD methods have a high efficiency and can ensure the purity of the extracted unchanged areas. Therefore, the unchanged areas are first obtained through any simple unsupervised CD method, such as the combination of multiband differencing and k-means used in the proposed framework.
The complete class labels are input into SVM to calculate the class posterior probability image of the same date as the class labels, while the class labels in the unchanged areas are used as the training samples for SVM to calculate the class posterior probability image of another date.
2) Unary Potential of the Binary CD Task Obtained by the FCM Algorithm: FCM is adopted to obtain the unary potential for the binary CD task. The difference image is usually used as the input of FCM in unsupervised CRF to obtain the change probability, but this is easily influenced by the radiation difference. To make better use of the class-prior knowledge and to judge the change probability of a pixel from the perspective of LULC classes, the similarity of the SVM probability outputs (P T 1 and P T 2 ) is used in the unary potential construction of the binary CD task. Thus, both the spectral difference and the class posterior probability similarity are used to describe the change probability by separately inputting them into the FCM algorithm and then summing over the outputs.
The class posterior probability of a certain pixel can be viewed as a normalized histogram distribution in the feature space. Therefore, the histogram distance can be used to estimate the similarity of the class posterior probabilities of each pixel between different dates. As shown in Fig. 
The commonly used histogram distance measurement methods include Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, the histogram intersection distance, intersection entropy, and so on. The G-statistic 
where f and h, respectively, stand for the two vectors of the class posterior probabilities that need to be compared, i represents the class that f or h may belong to, and L is the total number of compared classes. G( f, h) denotes the similarity of f and h. Therefore, the unary potential for the binary CD task is then constructed as an ensemble of the two change features
where P(y i = l|x SD , P T 1 , P T 2 ) is the posterior probability of pixels being given the label l ‚àà {0, 1}, and J denotes the FCM function. G(P T 1 , P T 2 ) represents the similarity of the class posterior probabilities P T 1 and P T 2 . | 3) Unary Potential of the Multiclass CD Task Obtained by the Probability Estimation:: The class posterior probabilities of a certain pixel at different dates are independent of each other, satisfying the statistical independence assumption. As a result, the unary potential of the multiclass CD task can be considered as the product of the class posterior probabilities on two dates, according to the joint probability calculation rule. Thus, the unary potential of the multiclass CD task is defined as
where x T 1 and x T 2 separately stand for the original image on dates T 1 and T 2 , P T 1 (y 
C is the number of classes. | C. Pairwise Potential: Analyzing HSR remote sensing images using a single pixel as the elementary unit leads to a lot of salt-and-pepper noise due the spectral variability phenomenon. The pairwise potential in CRF is used to solve this problem by taking the neighborhood spatial information around the center pixel into consideration in both the labeled and observed fields. In order to smooth the noise and focus on the detailed contextual information at the same time 
where the value
is the Euclidean distance (ED) between adjacent pixels i and j , and œÉ 2 is estimated as the mean value of the ED of all the pixels. As shown in the above formula, if the two adjacent pixels are labeled with different classes, the neighborhood information is ignored. If the class labels of the two pixels are the same, the more similar change features lead to greater neighborhood contributions. There is no limit to the number of classes, so the pairwise potential is applicable to both the binary and multiclass CD tasks. Here, an eight-neighborhood is considered to construct the spatial correlation of the center pixels. | D. Object Constraint: An object constraint is applied in the COCRF framework to reduce the FAs caused by spectral anomalies. The objects are acquired using a multiresolution segmentation approach conducted on the stacked multitemporal images, so that the objects in both images are consistent and have good homogeneity. The segmentation map x SM = {x SM s |s = 1, 2, . . . , S}, where S is the number of segmented objects, is used to model the object constraint. The corresponding value of the segmentation map is defined by the binary or multiclass change probability of each pixel. The object constraint is determined according to the dispersion degree of the inner classes within the object.
With the unary potential, the change type of each pixel can be determined with the highest class posterior probability. Pixels with the same change type are grouped into an inner class x SM sc of the current object x SM s . The inner class that contains the most pixels within an object is considered as the center class x SM so of the object, and y so is the label of the center class.
The average class posterior probability of each inner class within a certain object is considered as the probability characteristic of each inner class. The G-statistic distance between each inner class x SM sc and the center class x SM so is obtained by the use of (4) to express the dispersion degree within the current object. The proportion of pixels contained in each inner class within the current object to the total pixels of the object is also used in the calculation of the object constraint.
The formulation of the object constraint is finally defined as follows:
, y sc = y so 0, y sc = y so 
The object constraint can decrease the spectral variability of the same class between different dates. If there is a greater distance between the inner classes and the center class of one object, it is considered that the object has greater spectral variability and requires a stronger object constraint. In addition, the object constraint is proportional to the number of pixels within each inner class. An inner class containing a small number of pixels is considered to have been incorrectly divided into the current object due to incorrect segmentation boundaries. Therefore, a weak object constraint can reduce the impact of segmentation boundary errors and make the boundaries of the final results smoother. | E. Inference and Parameter Estimation: A local approximation approach named LBP, which finds the optimal state of the labeled image with the maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion, is used to map the final binary and multiclass CD results. LBP is flexible in the modeling and is performed by passing the updated message within the eight-connected neighborhood during the iterations 
In the COCRF framework, some parameters need to be estimated, including the segmentation scale and the weights of the pairwise potential and object constraint. To reduce the run time of selecting suitable parameters, an adaptive parameter estimation strategy is used to obtain the coefficient Œª of the pairwise potential.
The coefficient Œ≤ MC D keeps the balance between the unary and pairwise potentials. When the spatial homogeneity of the observed field between the center pixel and its neighborhood is higher, the coefficient R sc should be greater, which means that the label of this pixel should have a higher probability of being consistent with the labels in the neighborhood. In this way, Œª BC D is adaptively set for each pixel. Anisotropic local polynomial approximation-based intersection of confidence intervals (LPA-ICIs) is adopted to obtain the adaptive coefficient Œ≤ BC D . LPA-ICI was first proposed in 2004 for image denoising 
5) R sc for each pixel is then defined as
The coefficient Œ≤ of the object constraint is the reciprocal of Œª because a pixel with a lower pairwise potential requires a stronger object constraint to distinguish whether it should be smoothed. To analyze the effect of the adaptive parameter estimation strategy, a nonadaptive COCRF (NACOCRF) framework which uses manually set parameters was compared with the proposed COCRF framework. The segmentation scale is still set manually, but the framework is less sensitive to this parameter, which is proved in Section IV | III. ALTERNATIVE CRF FUSION STRATEGY FOR THE BINARY AND MULTICLASS CD TASKS: The binary CD task is executed before the multiclass CD task in the proposed COCRF framework, so that the framework needs to execute the object-oriented CRF model twice, which takes double the time. Thus, a jointly optimized COCRF (JOCOCRF) framework with the same components as the proposed COCRF framework but different processes is proposed by jointly optimizing both the binary and multiclass CD tasks. The object-oriented CRF model only needs to be run once because the two tasks are combined in the unary potential. The weight coefficients of the unary potentials of the two tasks are specified by the significance of the two unary potentials. The sum of the two weight coefficients is equal to one. Finally, the unary potential is an integration of the potentials of the binary and multiclass CD tasks
where w i represents the confidence of each pixel for the potential of the binary CD task, which is calculated according to the variance of the probability distributions of the binary and multiclass CD tasks. The larger the variance of the binary CD probability distributionvar (œï B i (x, y i )), the higher the confidence for the potential of the binary CD task, and the lower the confidence for the potential of the multiclass CD task.
The JOCOCRF framework needs less time and fewer parameters than the COCRF framework. However, the fusion of the unary potentials for the binary and multiclass CD tasks is completely unsupervised, so that there is no guarantee that a credible change probability or class posterior probability can be selected. Thus, the JOCOCRF framework is less robust to different data sets and varying segmentation scales, which is shown in Section IV. | IV. EXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSIS:  | A. Experimental Description: Two sets of HSR remote sensing images with different spatial resolutions and geometric complexities, plus a class-labeled map, were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed COCRF framework compared with the state-of-the-art CD methods. In addition, the NACOCRF and JOCOCRF frameworks were considered as alternative frameworks.
The segmentation map used for the object constraint was generated by multiresolution segmentation in eCognition, and the parameters for the shape and compactness were set as 0.2/0.8 for both data sets. The segmentation scales for the two data sets are listed in Table  | TABLE I PARAMETER SETTINGS OF THE RANDOM FIELD-BASED METHODS: sets 
For the multiclass CD task, the proposed frameworks were compared with a change analysis approach based on the integration of backdating and an object-based method (BOB) 
The three proposed COCRF frameworks were also compared with global PCC and global DC based on pixel-based and object-oriented CRF models (PCC_PCRF, DC_PCRF, PCC_OCRF, DC_OCRF), without using the mask constraint of the binary CD result. The four experiments were conducted to analyze the significance of each module of the proposed framework. The parameters of the random field-based methods were manually set, according to the sensitivity analysis, as shown in Table 
For the quantitative analysis, five measurements are used to evaluate the accuracy of the binary CD results: FAs, missed alarms (MA), overall accuracy (OA), Kappa coefficient, and F1 score. FA is the number of pixels incorrectly classified as changed over the total number of unchanged pixels in the reference map. MA is the number of pixels incorrectly classified as unchanged over the total number of changed pixels in the reference map  | B. Experiment 1: Shiyan QuickBird Data Set: The two images in the first remote sensing data set were acquired by the QuickBird satellite in 2002 and 2004, with four multispectral bands of a 2.4-m spatial resolution. The study area is Shiyan city, Hubei province, China. The spatial size of the images is 250 √ó 250 pixels, as shown in Fig. 
The results of the different binary CD methods (KI, OBCD, MRF, CRF, NACOCRF, COCRF, and JOCOCRF) for the Shiyan QuickBird data set are displayed in Fig. 
The quantitative results for the binary CD are listed in Table  | C. Experiment 2: Hankou IKONOS Data Set: To validate the proposed framework in a situation with more complex spatial geometric features, an HSR data set of a different sensor was used in the second experiment. The Wuhan urban area images with four multispectral bands of a 4-m spatial resolution were recorded by the IKONOS sensor over Wuhan in Hubei province, China, in 2008 and 2009. The spatial size of the images is 300 √ó 400 pixels, as shown in Fig. 
The binary CD results (KI, OBCD, MRF, CRF, NACOCRF, COCRF, and JOCOCRF) for the Wuhan IKONOS data set are shown in Fig. 
In the multiclass CD task, the BOB approach shows a few falsely detected change directions, as marked in black, but many change directions are wrongly assumed as unchanged at the same time, as shown in Fig.  | V. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The parameters denoted by Œª and Œ≤ play important roles in the proposed object-oriented CRF model, where Œª is the weight of the pairwise potential and Œ≤ is the weight of the object constraint. The two parameters control the smoothness of the whole area and the local objects, respectively. The object constraint comes from the segmentation maps, so that the segmentation scale is also an important parameter to be estimated. For all three proposed frameworks, the segmentation scale is selected by manual setting. Sensitivity curves for the segmentation scales are shown in Fig.  | VI. CONCLUSION: The COCRF framework with adaptive parameter estimation strategy has been proposed in this article to realize binary and multiclass CD for HSR remote sensing images. In addition, the NACOCRF framework, which selects the parameters by manual setting, and a jointly optimized JOCOCRF framework have also been proposed in this article. For HSR remote sensing images, a large number of unsupervised algorithms have been proposed, but few of them focus on the multiclass CD task. Thus, our work addresses this application gap. The similarity of the class posterior probabilities is used, together with the spectral difference, in the construction of the unary potential, to acquire a more robust binary CD result, which was found to be superior to the results of the compared binary CD methods. The object constraint works for the proposed high-order CRF model so that the spatial correlation is considered at the object level and the noise is effectively eliminated. Finally, the change direction is detected by the probability estimation. In the NACOCRF and COCRF frameworks, the binary CD result is used as a mask constraint, so that change directions that do not exist are not detected and FAs are greatly reduced. In the JOCOCRF framework, the binary and multiclass CD tasks are fused in the unary potential, so that the binary and multiclass CD results can be obtained at the same time, which greatly improves the computational efficiency. Although the unsupervised fusion of the two tasks is less robust to different data sets, it has great research value. What is more, the adaptive parameter estimation strategy helps to obtain more robust results and saves a lot of work and time, which will be of great value in practical applications. All in all, the multiclass CD task is of great importance in various applications. In our future work, the application and potential of the multiclass CD task for HSR remote sensing images will be further explored. Unsupervised parameter setting and multitask fusion strategies, which should improve the efficiency of the model operation, will become our main research directions.","Review article digital change detection techniques using remotely-sensed data (, Jun. 1989) || Evolution and behavioural responses to human-induced rapid environmental change (, , , Mar. 2011) || A method to detect earthquake-collapsed buildings from high-resolution satellite images (, , Dec. 2013) || A comprehensive review of earthquake-induced building damage detection with remote sensing techniques (, , Oct. 2013) || A remote sensing-GIS evaluation of urban expansion and its impact on surface temperature in the Zhujiang Delta, China (, Jul. 2001) || Monitoring land cover change in urban and peri-urban areas using dense time stacks of Landsat satellite data and a data mining approach (, Sep. 2012) || Detecting trends in forest disturbance and recovery using yearly Landsat time series: 1.

"An Analysis of Urban Land Use/Land Cover Changes in Blantyre City, Southern Malawi (1994-2018)",John Mawenda; Teiji Watanabe; Ram Avtar,"Rapid and unplanned urban growth has adverse environmental and social consequences. This is prominent in sub-Saharan Africa where the urbanisation rate is high and characterised by the proliferation of informal settlements. It is, therefore, crucial that urban land use/land cover (LULC) changes be investigated in order to enhance effective planning and sustainable growth. In this paper, the spatial and temporal LULC changes in Blantyre city were studied using the integration of remotely sensed Landsat imageries of 1994, 2007 and 2018, and a geographic information system (GIS). The supervised classification method using the support vector machine algorithm was applied to generate the LULC maps. The study also analysed the transition matrices derived from the classified map to identify prominent processes of changes for planning prioritisation. The results showed that the built-up class, which included urban structures such as residential, industrial, commercial and public installations, increased in the 24-year study period. On the contrary, bare land, which included vacant lands, open spaces with little or no vegetation, hilly clear-cut areas and other fallow land, declined over the study period. This was also the case with the vegetation class (i.e., forests, parks, permanent tree-covered areas and shrubs). The post-classification results revealed that the LULC changes during the second period (2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015)(2016)(2017)(2018) were faster compared to the first period (1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007). Furthermore, the results revealed that the increase in built-up areas systematically targeted the bare land and avoided the vegetated areas, and that the vegetated areas were systematically cleared to bare land during the study period . The findings of this study have revealed the pressure of human activities on the land and natural environment in Blantyre and provided the basis for sustainable urban planning and development in Blantyre city.","Introduction: Studying land use/land cover (LULC) is vital for enhancing our understanding of global environmental change and sustainability 
Like other anthropogenic-environmental interactions, urban LULC changes are due to a myriad of factors, as no single factor can account for these changes. The interactions are different in every region, but most scholars agree that most LULC changes are influenced by specific economic, demographic, socio-political and environmental conditions 
Malawi is among the world's least developed and one of the most densely populated countries in Africa. Like other developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Malawi has been experiencing progressive urban growth since it attained its independence on 6th July 1964. Malawi's system of governance changed from a one-party rule dictatorship  to a multiparty democratic system from 1994 to the present. During the democratic rule, the urban population increased 2-fold from 1,095,419 in 1998 to 2,115,867 in 2018 in its four main cities of Lilongwe, Blantyre, Mzuzu and Zomba, where over 70 per cent lives in informal settlements 
Despite that several studies have been done on LULC changes in Malawi 
Over the past three decades, advances in remote sensing technologies have expedited LULC change studies. By obtaining satellite imagery over a period of time, remote sensing methods can be utilised to analyse historical LULC changes 
Although cities in Malawi actively engage in planning-including the development of master plans that provide an overview of spatial and infrastructural intentions, strategic plans that outline the broad ways in which thematic issues are to be addressed and investment plans that list priority infrastructure-the plans are barely recognised by the public in urban jurisdictions and often lack effective implementation mechanisms. This is usually blamed on a lack of resources 
In Blantyre city, the second-largest city in Malawi by population and size, the urban LULC situation is unclear and has not yet been quantified. There is also not enough empirical data on urban LULC changes over time. Therefore, the aim of this study is to analyse urban LULC changes from 1994 to 2018 in Blantyre city using remotely sensed Landsat data in order to support sustainable urban planning. The year of 1994 was chosen as a start date because it is when Malawi changed its governance system from a one-party system to a multiparty system. The year of 2018 was chosen as the end date because it is when the field verification was taken, while the year of 2007 was chosen as an intermediate date to illustrate the rates of change.
The study also identified random and systematic transitions derived from the classified maps to focus on prominent signals of change in the study area. The study period 1994-2018 was chosen in order to understand how the democratic governance systems influenced the LULC changes in urban environments of Blantyre city. The significance of the study is threefold: (1) the study will reveal the underlying human processes in the urban environment and their interactions; (2) the information generated can assist with managing the pressures of human activities and urban developments on the land, and (3) the results of this study can be used as baseline information to determine future urban land use and for setting policy priorities to promote inclusive and equitable urban development.
Ultimately, this will help to realise well-balanced urban growth for citizens and the environment in Blantyre city. | Materials and Methods:  | Study Area: Blantyre is the oldest and second-largest city in Malawi. It was established by the Scottish missionaries in the 1870s and declared a planning area in 1897. It is the main commercial city hosting most of the private sector headquarters in the country. The city lies within the latitude 15 ‚Ä¢ 47 10"" S and longitude 35 ‚Ä¢ 00 20.10"" E, as shown in Figure 
In 1966, Blantyre was the prime city in Malawi with 109,461 people, seconded by Zomba, the then capital city, with only 19,666 inhabitants. With the transfer of the capital city from Zomba to Lilongwe, as part of a deliberate government policy to redistribute the urban population and implement spatially balanced development across the country  | Remote Sensing Data: The remotely sensed data used for this study were Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) with 30 m spatial resolution and a 16 day repeat cycle  | Image Processing: The Landsat images were an L1T product (systematically, geometrically and topographically corrected). The study area was clipped as a vector file onto the Landsat image in ArcGIS Pro software (ESRI, Redland, CA, USA). In order to reduce confusion between spectral features and improve overall image classification, the radiometric and atmospheric corrections were applied using the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) Model in ENVI 5.2 software (Harris Geospatial, Broomfield, CA, USA) prior to image classification  | Image Classification: The support vector machine (SVM) classifier in the supervised classification scheme in ArcGIS Pro software (ESRI, Redland, CA, USA) was employed to derive four major LULC classes, namely bare land, built-up area, vegetation and water, as shown in Table  | LULC Classes Description:  | Bare land: Vacant lands, open areas with little or no vegetation, exposed rocks, quarry, hilly clear-cut areas and other idle fallow land sometimes illegally used for agriculture. | Built-up area: Urban structures of all types: residential, industrial, commercial, public installations, roads/highways and other similar facilities. | Vegetation: Forest, parks and permanent tree-covered areas, temporary croplands, grassland, shrubs and other idle lands along streams. Water Permanent open water, especially manmade dams/ponds.
The classes were adopted from  | Accuracy Assessment: Accuracy assessment is a prerequisite step in the LULC classification process. This aims to quantitatively determine how effectively pixels are grouped into the correct feature classes in the area under investigation 
where N is the total number of observations in the error matrix, r is the number of rows and columns in the error matrix, X ii is the number of observations in row i and column i (i.e., the diagonal elements), X +i is the marginal total of row I, X i+ is the marginal total of column i.
A Kappa value greater than 0.80 indicates excellent agreement, while a value between 0.4 and 0.80 indicates moderate agreement and a value less than or equal to 0.4 indicates poor agreement between classification categories  | Annual Rates of Change: For an improved description of LULC changes, we calculated the annual rate of change. This process measures the amount of LULC change per year and was calculated according to the approach proposed by 
where R is the rate of change, A 1 and A 2 are the area in km 2 at the beginning and end of the analysis period, and t 1 and t 2 correspond to the time in years from start to finish, respectively. | Land Use/Land Cover Change Detection: LULC change detection was carried out by a post-classification comparison of bi-temporal maps. This is perhaps the most common approach for change detection

There have been distinct urban LULC changes in Blantyre city over the 24-year period. The changes are mainly characterised by an increase in a built-up area and a decrease in bare land and vegetation. The water class remained constant (less than 0.5 per cent of the study area) throughout the study period. Overall, the built-up area increased at an annual rate of 5.34 per cent from 1994 to 2018. In the first period 
Bare land declined at the annual rate of 0.52 per cent over the study period. However, during the first period  | Accuracy Assessment of the LULC Classification: Table  | Post-Classification Change Detection: Table 
The matrices were also analysed to understand the transition budget by calculating the gains, losses, total change, swap and net change as shown in Table 
The losses and the resulting swap proportions for the built-up class would not be expected but it could have resulted from the errors of commission and omission during the classification process. The error of commission and omission are the complement of the user's and the producer's accuracies, respectively, as shown in Table  | Detection of Random and Systematic Transitions: This study further analysed the transition matrix for 1994 and 2018 in order to identify the most significant changes among the LULC classes. The expected gains under the random process of gain were calculated using Equation (3). The expected gains and the differences between the observed and expected proportions are given in Table 
The differences between the observed and expected gains for vegetation to the built-up area (-1. 
The equivalent relationship between the different LULC classes, which examines the actual and expected losses under the random process of loss, is shown in Table 
In a nutshell, there has been a systematic conversion of the bare land class to the built-up class as well as a systematic degradation of the vegetation class to the bare land class in Blantyre city over the 24-year study period. This was demonstrated by the concurrent incidences of the systematic gains and losses  | Discussion: The results indicated that there were increased anthropogenic-induced urban LULC changes in Blantyre city over the past 24 years. This was substantiated by the observed accelerated increase in built-up area from 4.1 per cent during the initial period to almost 7 per cent in the later period, with an overall annual change at 5.3 per cent. This is similar to the accelerated declining rates observed for the vegetation and bare land classes (Section 3.1). The increase in the built-up class is comparable to other studies conducted in the sub-Saharan African cities, including the Dakar metropolitan area in Senegal, Nairobi city in Kenya, and Harare city in Zimbabwe, which experienced an increase in built-up areas at the annual rates of 9.6, 9.5 and 4.7 per cent, respectively, between the years 1990 and 2014 
Firstly, the observed annual growth rate of 5.3 per cent for the built-up class in the study area surpassed the urban population growth rate estimated at 2.3 per cent between 1998 and 2018 
Secondly, the vegetation loss observed in this study signifies the loss of green spaces (such as forests and parks) 
Lastly, the decline in bare land exerts enormous pressure on land suitable for urban development. Recently, over 10,000 families were reported to have built their houses illegally in areas such as wetlands, steep slopes and river/stream buffer zones in the city 
Furthermore, the analysis of the transitional matrix derived from the 1994 and 2018 classified maps, as shown in Table 
These systematic processes suggest that the gain in built-up targets bare land and avoids vegetation. This can be explained by the fact that most land under vegetated areas, such as Ndirande, Soche and Kanjedza forest reserves, as well as the Mudi catchment area, are protected leaving bare land vulnerable to conversion to built-up. Additionally, most vegetated areas have unsuitable land for development, such as wetlands, steep slopes and river/stream buffer zones. Likewise, the gain in bare land systematically targets the vegetation class and avoids the built-up class. This systematic process has caused the loss of vegetative cover in the study area. This loss could be explained by anthropogenic activities, such as wood extraction for firewood, brick burning and lapses in management  | Limitations of the Study: This study used Landsat data with a spatial resolution of 30 m, meaning that the changes below this pixel size might have been missed during classification processes. Therefore, the use of high-resolution satellite data could have provided more detailed information about LULC changes with higher accuracy. | Conclusions: This study provides the details of urban LULC changes in Blantyre city from 1994 to 2018 characterised by an increase in built-up area and the decline of vegetation and bare land areas, respectively. The study further reveals a two-step temporal transition, firstly from the vegetation class to the bare land class, and from the bare land class to the built-up class. This clearly demonstrates the existence of inefficiencies in the management of urban growth in the city. Based on this information, urban development stakeholders can make policy and planning priorities to ensure sustainable urban development. In order to ensure sustainable urban development in Blantyre city, this study suggests that the authorities should expedite the allocation of all suitable land for development while safeguarding unauthorised development in risky areas. This study, further, calls for all planning authorities in Malawi at the city, district, regional and national levels to review physical plans more often and help to facilitate the timely supply of serviced land across the country.
Regarding the observed vegetation cover loss, some innovative policy measures, such as identifying crucial vegetation areas for protection from anthropogenic forces, could be implemented. There is also a need to enhance cooperation among urban stakeholders and local residents, including providing incentives that could encourage locals to conserve vegetation and allow natural regeneration on bare hills and other vegetation reserves within the city boundary.","Analysis of twenty years of categorical land transitions in the Lower Hunter of New South Wales (, , , , 2010) || Monitoring urban growth and land use change detection with GIS and remote sensing techniques in Daqahlia governorate Egypt (, , 2015) || UNDESA)/Population Division (, 2019) || UNDESA)/Population Division (, 2015) || Land change dynamics: Insights from Intensity Analysis applied to an African emerging city (, , , 2016) || Global change and the ecology of cities (, , , , , 2008. 15 November 2019) || Land Use Change and Biodiversity: A Synthesis of Rates and Consequences during the Period of Satellite Imagery.

However, there is still a gap of annual land use and land cover (LULC) information in all Brazilian biomes in the country. Existing countrywide efforts to map land use and land cover lack regularly updates and high spatial resolution time-series data to better understand historical land use and land cover dynamics, and the subsequent impacts in the country biomes. In this study, we described a novel approach and the results achieved by a multi-disciplinary network called MapBiomas to reconstruct annual land use and land cover information between 1985 and 2017 for Brazil, based on random forest applied to Landsat archive using Google Earth Engine. We mapped five major classes: forest, non-forest natural formation, farming, non-vegetated areas, and water. These classes were broken into two sub-classification levels leading to the most comprehensive and detailed mapping for the country at a 30 m pixel resolution. The average overall accuracy of the land use and land cover time-series, based on a stratified random sample of 75,000 pixel locations, was 89% ranging from 73 to 95% in the biomes. The 33 years of LULC change data series revealed that Brazil lost 71 Mha of natural vegetation, mostly to cattle ranching and agriculture activities. Pasture expanded by 46% from 1985 to 2017, and agriculture by 172%, mostly replacing old pasture fields. We also identified that 86 Mha of the converted native vegetation was undergoing some level of regrowth. Several applications of the MapBiomas dataset are underway, suggesting that reconstructing historical land use and land cover change maps is useful for advancing the science and to guide social, economic and environmental policy decision-making processes in Brazil.","Introduction: Our society is highly dependent on a functional and stable land system for food production, and to access natural resources including water, timber, fiber, ore and fuel, among other ecosystem services and goods 
Brazil is one of the richest biodiversity countries in the world 
Deforestation for pasture and agriculture expansion, infrastructure development, cities, and political and financial incentives to land occupation are the main drivers of LULC changes in the Brazilian biomes, affecting biodiversity, water resources, carbon emissions, regional and local climate 
Spatially explicit information on the historical trajectories of LULC in Brazil is key to inform the planning and the sustainable management of natural resources, policy formulation, among other societal applications. Nevertheless, as consequence of governmental policies and funding focused on the biomes that host most of the remaining Brazilian natural vegetation under threat, maps for measuring the historical extent and intensity of LULC change often exist for the Amazon and Cerrado biomes, and are scarce and/or lack adequate spatial and temporal resolution in the other biomes. Examples of mapping efforts include the Probio project from 2002 by the Brazilian Ministry of Environment, the National Inventory from 1994, 2002 and 2010 
The open access of Landsat archive 
The objectives of this paper were threefold. First, we aimed at presenting how we reconstructed the annual time-series of LULC maps for all the Brazilian biomes between 1985 and 2017, by combining Landsat data, GEE, machine learning and a network of local experts, in a concept of progressively evolving LULC map collections. The second objective was to assess the extent, rates and main drivers of LULC change in the Brazilian biomes between 1985 and 2017 using the LULC time-series produced. The last objective was to present the MapBiomas image processing and classification protocol which maps the main land cover classes separately for each biome and common cross-cutting land use themes (i.e., pasture, agriculture, coastal zone, and urban infrastructure) followed by the integration of the LULC map products. We then demonstrated that the proposed protocol of MapBiomas is a step-wise learning process from local experts and feedback from users to improve the annual LULC maps. We also discuss the current applications of this free open access dataset to science, policy and monitoring LULC change in Brazil, as well as the remaining uncertainties and challenges of our LULC mapping approach. | Materials and Methods:  | Study Area and LULC Approach: Brazil is a megadiverse country, the largest in South America. Its vast territory occupies more than 851 Mha embracing six unique biodiversity-rich biomes named Amazon, Cerrado, Caatinga, Pampa, Pantanal and Atlantic Forest (Figure  | Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) Classification: Defining a classification system remains a challenge for remote sensing and land ecosystem studies, especially for harmonizing different map products  | Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) Classification: Defining a classification system remains a challenge for remote sensing and land ecosystem studies, especially for harmonizing different map products  | Savanna Formation: Vegetation types with a tree layer varying in density, distributed over a continuous shrub-herbaceous layer. | Mangrove: Dense and evergreen forest formation often flooded by tide and associated with the mangrove coastal ecosystem. | Forest Plantation: Planted tree species for commercial use. | Non-Forest Formation: Non-Forest Formation in Wetland Floodplain with fluvial and lake influence, subject to periodic or permanent flooding, located along watercourses and in lowlands areas that accumulate water, with herbaceous shrub vegetation and/or arboreal and pioneer formations, and marshes (marine influence). | Grassland Formation: Vegetation type with a predominance of herbaceous stratum, including patches with a well developed shrub-herbaceous stratum.
Salt flat ""Apicuns"" or salt flats are formations often without tree vegetation, associated to saline and a less flooded area in the mangrove, generally in the transition between this area and the continent.
Other Non-Forest Formation Natural grasslands, Savanna, Park Savanna, Steppe Savanna, Woody-Grassland Savanna, ""Campinarana"" in the Amazon biome. The MapBiomas LULC Classification System can be linked to other international and national classification systems  | Remote Sensing Dataset: The satellite imagery dataset used in the MapBiomas project was composed by the Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and the Operational Land Imager (OLI) Landsat sensors, on board Landsat 5, Landsat 7 and Landsat 8, respectively. MapBiomas used Collection 1 Tier 1 from  | Pre-Processing: The mapping unit adopted in the MapBiomas project was defined based on the subdivision of the International Chart of the World to the Millionth on the 1:250,000 scale. Each tile covers an area of 1 ‚Ä¢ 30 of longitude by 1 ‚Ä¢ of latitude, totaling 558 tiles covering all the Brazilian biomes (Figure 
The first pre-processing step was to build cloud-free annual tile Landsat mosaics yearly. Cloud and cloud shadow masks were applied to all Landsat scenes. For that, we used the temporal dark outlier mask (TDOM)  | Landsat Feature Space: The annual Landsat scenes produced in the pre-processing step were used to generate the feature space (i.e., variables) used as input for the random forest classifier. All cloud-free Landsat scenes acquired over the biomes in a given year were used to produce temporal annual mosaics with spectral bands and index, fractions and index from spectral mixture analysis (SMA), temporal index (based on median, min, amplitude and standard deviation reducers) and textural index. The images from the best period of each biome (Table 
After building the annual mosaics, the next step was to build the feature space for the random forest classifier. For that, we used the compositional, spectral, temporal and textural information extracted from the image annual mosaics and from all cloud-free pixels within the year. Fractional information was obtained with spectral mixture analysis (SMA; Tables 
The temporal mosaics procedure described above is not optimal to separate all LULC, especially agriculture and pasture and non-forest formations due to seasonal changes. To overcome this limitation, some classes were classified separately, as cross-cutting themes. These classes included: pasture, agriculture, forest plantation, urban infrastructure, and mining. Each cross-cutting theme (used a specific classification approach with all cloud-free Landsat scenes available yearly, or a temporal mosaic for specific intra-annual period, to highlight the seasonal change and better distinguish these LULC classes. Additionally, the feasibility to derive the 104 variables varied temporally and spatially due to data availability and cloud conditions. The areas affected by these factors, with less Landsat data, generally produced poorer classification results which were corrected using the temporal filtering approach. More information about the cross-cutting theme input images and their classification methods are provided in the Appendix S2. | Random Forest Classification: We used the random forest classifier available in Google Earth Engine for LULC classification 
For training the random forest classifier, we applied two approaches. For the Amazon biome, we combined existing land cover maps to randomly select and automatically assign the land cover classes to the training samples. We extrapolated the land cover class assigned to the training sample for the years that did not have land cover maps from other sources. Image analysts inspected Landsat color composites of these years and reassigned the correct land cover to the training samples. For the other biomes, we built training samples for the random forest classifier using a previous MapBiomas Collection 2.3 as a reference to identify stable land cover classes; i.e., pixels with no change in land cover over the timespan of this map collection  | Post-Classification Filters and Map Integration: The final classification result for each map tile consisted of three products: (a) classification (no post-processing), (b) classification after applying spatial and temporal filters and (c) post-filter, integrated classification resulting from combining with cross-cutting themes following empirically defined prevalence orders. The first post-classification action was the application of spatial and temporal filters to the maps generated in the LULC classification step. The application of these filters removed classification noise and disallowable LULC class transitions. The temporal filter was also used to fill the information gap due to the cloud. These post-classification procedures were implemented in the Google Earth Engine platform and are described in more detail below. | Spatial Filter: The spatial filter segmented and indexed the classes of each collection into contiguous regions  | Temporal Filter: The temporal filter seeks to identify and correct the class transitions that are expected along a series of consecutive years (i.e., 3 to 5), as well as to fill in pixels with no data caused by cloud cover  | Map Integration: The biome products of digital classification after temporal filter application, for each of the 33 years in the period 1985-2017, were then integrated with the cross-cutting themes, by applying a set of specific hierarchical prevalence rules (Table  | LULC Transitions: Transition classes represent LULC change measured by the annual pixel-to-pixel class difference between 1985 and 2017. A similar spatial filter described in the Section 2.3.5 was applied in the transition maps to remove spurious isolated class transitions. The aim of the LULC transition filter is to eliminate single pixels or streams of pixels on the border of different classes derived from the created transition maps. The general rule applied in this filter was to remove from the transition classes' single isolated pixels and streams of up to five pixels along the border of transition classes. | Accuracy Assessment and Area Estimation: Accuracy assessment analysis and area estimation were performed based on ~75,000 independent samples (named reference dataset) at the Landsat pixel level for each one of the years from 1985 to 2017 in all of Brazil (Appendix S3). These samples were generated by a stratified random sampling, which considered 127 regular strata (resulting from the spatial aggregation of neighbors tiles from International Charts of the World to the Millionth on the 1:250,000 scale), a confidence interval of 95%, and a maximum standard error of 5% to establish the sample size for each stratum, following the good practices proposed by 
Each sample (i.e., Landsat pixel) was inspected by three independent interpreters, and in case of disagreement among interpreters, a senior interpreter assigns the final LULC class of the pixel. This evaluation was performed using the Temporal Visual Inspection web application (TVI-tvi.lapig.iesa.ufg.br), developed by the Laborat√≥rio de Processamento de Imagens e Geoprocessamento (Lapig).The TVI application allowed the evaluation of all LULC classes using at least two Landsat images per year, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation index, precipitation time-series, and high-resolution imagery available in Google Earth. Accessing all these datasets for each sample through a graphical user interface of TVI with satellite image color composites to provide texture and contextual information, spectrum-temporal graphs to assess phenology of LULC class, and higher spatial resolution imagery, allowed the interpreters to evaluate and differentiate the LULC classes (Table 
Subsequently, we used a majority agreement rule, which considers the LULC class assigned by the majority of the interpreters as the final one to the reference sample. Finally, a classification error matrix was created and several metrics (i.e., global user and producer accuracies, quantity and allocation disagreement) were calculated for each year, class and biome, following a standard good practice protocol  | Results:  | LULC Map Accuracy: We generated 33 annual LULC maps for Brazil with Landsat data from 1985 to 2017 using Google Earth Engine at 30 m pixel resolution. First, we presented the temporal trends of the five main LULC classes including forest, non-forest formation, farming, non-vegetated area and water (Table  | LULC Spatial and Temporal Trends in Brazil: In 1985, the forest class, which also includes forest plantation, secondary forest and old growth forest with or without signs of degradation by fire, forest fragmentation or selective logging, covered 70.5% of the Brazil's territory, with 600 Mha. The total extent of the farming class reached 172 Mha in that year, with the second largest extent of land cover (20.3% of the territory). The minority land cover classes in terms of extent were non-forest formation (63.4 Mha, 7.48%), followed by surface water with 12.5 Mha (1.47%) and non-vegetated area (2.17 Mha, 0.25%) (Table 
At the country level, the water class showed the lowest annual average percent change (0.17% per year; s ¬± 7.12%) with a more pronounced trend towards reducing surface water between 2010 and 2017 in the Caatinga and Cerrado biomes (Figure 
Non-vegetated area was the LULC class with the smallest extent, but showed a rapid increase in area from 1985 to 2017 with an average expansion rate of 1.72% per year (s ¬± 10.2%) in the whole country (Figure 
The farming class also expanded between 1985 and 2017 at rate of 1.7% per year (s ¬± 3.8%) (Figure 
The non-forested formation class showed an annual change of -0.34% per year (s ¬± 2.8%) between 1985 and 2017. The Atlantic Forest and the Pampa biomes showed the highest rate of shrinking with -0.83% and -0.68% per year on average, respectively. The remaining biomes had a lower annual average reduction of non-forested areas ranging between -0.06% per year in the Amazon and -0.2% in the Cerrado (Figure 
decreasing change in surface water. In Amazon biome, we also detected a slight signal of surface water reduction in the 2010s. The Atlantic Forest and Pampa biomes also showed a minor trend towards an increase in surface water and higher variation over the time-series period. However, surface water had the lowest extent in the Pampa biome between 1985 and 1995. The Pantanal biome presented the highest variation of surface water exhibiting a twenty-year harmonic cycle (1985-2005) (Figure  | The Main LULC Change in Brazil: The spatial distribution of these LULC classes in 1985 and 2017 are shown in Figure 
The grassland class was mapped in all biomes except in the Amazon (Figure 
The pasture class showed different annual trends in the biomes with periods of continuing expansion (Amazon and Pantanal), stabilization after 1995 (Caatinga, Cerrado), and shrinking (Atlantic Forest). This class was not mapped in the Pampa biome because natural grasslands area is used for raising animals in this biome. Overall, the pasture area increased by 45.4 Mha in Brazil from 1985 to 2017 (Table 
River, lakes and ocean (RLO), as well as urban infrastructure LULC classes had an increase in area between 1985 and 2017 of 1.0 Mha each (Table  | LULC Biome Transitions: We estimated 63.5% of the Brazilian territory did not undergo change in its original land cover class from 1985 to 2017, totaling 540.7 Mha (Table 
The vegetation loss totaled 102.4 Mha, representing 33% of the total area that underwent LULC change between 1985 and 2017 (i.e., 310.8 Mha; Table

Shifting land-use was responsible for 31.6% of the total LULC change between 1985 and 2017 (Table  | Discussion: This is the first time that LULC change has been quantified in all Brazilian biomes with this degree of spatial detail (i.e., at 30 m pixel size) using +30-year time-series Landsat data. Until now, this LULC change information in Brazil was either restricted in space and time, covering a few biomes and short periods of time (e.g., 
The LULC annual dataset presented in this study allowed numerous applications, such as the estimation of vegetation gain and loss, and the understanding of land cover drivers. Between 1985 and 2017, 38% of the Brazilian territory was modified by cattle ranching and agriculture activities, as well as infrastructure development, changing native forest and non-forest formations, indistinctly in all six biomes. Pasture expanded by 46% in the country, mainly in the Amazon and Pantanal biomes, while agriculture increased by 172%, mostly in the Atlantic Forest replacing old pastures and in the Cerrado biomes converting savanna and grasslands formations. Our LULC dataset revealed that 86 Mha of the converted native vegetation is undergoing some level of regrowth. The MapBiomas time-series also generated that, in the Amazon biome, secondary vegetation increased 12 Mha in 2017 
We built the LULC maps of this study iterating over map collections, such as that applied to MODIS global land cover products 
Yet, besides the gain in information brought by MapBiomas LULC Collection 3.1, there are still challenges and limitations to be overcome. First, overall accuracy was lower than 80% in highly seasonal and heterogeneous biomes (e.g., Cerrado, Caatinga, Pantanal and Pampa). The Amazon biome, with most of the land cover comprised by forest, had the highest overall mapping accuracy of 95%. However, less predominant LULC classes had lower accuracy in all biomes. For example, the spatial variability of native vegetation types and spectral similarity among LULC classes, such as grassland and pasture, are challenging to separate 
Several studies have already been published by the MapBiomas network to better understand the spatial-temporal LULC dynamics in Brazilian biomes focusing on specific LULC classes. For example, surface water dynamics in the Amazon region 
All products, methods and tools of the MapBiomas Project are open access, transparent and publicly available in the internet (https://mapbiomas.org/) for non-commercial use. With open access data, it was possible to perfect the LULC maps with end-user feedback, which reached one hundred thousand users in 2019. Additionally, more than one hundred peer-reviewed research articles were published between 2017 and 2019 using the LULC maps of this project. Since the first MapBiomas Collection, the applications of this dataset keep growing in science including, for example, the assessment of conservation and biodiversity policies  | Conclusions: We reconstructed LULC time-series information over three decades in Brazil, based on Google Earth Engine cloud-computing, freely available Landsat data and a collaborative network of experts willing to share knowledge. Our LULC mapping protocol required breaking up the image classification per biome and cross-cutting themes, followed by the post-classification map integration rules. This process was required to account for the unique conditions of the biomes, including the phenological changes of LULC classes, the availability of Landsat data due to cloud conditions, and the history and intensity of land use. The accuracy assessment was used to define the optimum period of each biome using calibration data training embedded in the random forest classifier. Classifying separately cross-cutting classes (e.g., pasture, agriculture and urban infrastructure) was necessary to reduce spectral confusion in the random forest. The key element of our LULC approach is the post-classification integration protocol, which requires spatial coherence of the integrated maps along the biome boundaries. Finally, we decided to put the LULC maps openly available prior to the scientific publications, with a detailed description of the methodology. This allowed several scientific publications using our LULC dataset in Brazil and abroad, and getting feedback from the data users to improve our maps. Policy-makers are also using the LULC dataset to make, plan and assess public policies in the country. The MapBiomas collaborative initiative is also expanding to generate new LULC products in other countries, such as in the Pan-Amazonian countries (https://amazonia.mapbiomas.org/), Chaco region (https://chaco.mapbiomas.org/) and most recently in Indonesia. Based on MapBiomas experience in Brazil, involving local institutions and experts, and international partners, our LULC mapping protocol will likely expand to other countries contributing to support science and societal applications and better policy decisions.

Predicting changes in land use/land cover and seasonal land surface temperature using multi-temporal landsat images in the northwest region of Bangladesh,Abdulla -Al Kafy; Abdullah Al-Faisal; Abdullah Al Rakib; Sumita Roy; Jannatul Ferdousi; Vinay Raikwar; Marium Kona; S Abdullah; Al Fatin; H I G H L I G H T S,Configurations of LULC and seasonal LST change in the Northwest region of Bangladesh were analyzed. Built-up area expansion contributed to increased summer and winter LST by 0.55 C and 2.54 C per decade from 1999-2019. Temperature increases have resulted in a significant decline in agricultural productivity over the last 30 years. Summer and winter LST simulations indicate that more than 50 % and 13 % will likely be in >35 C by 2039. Prediction of LULC change and seasonal LST variation needs to be considered during urban development plans.,"Introduction: Urbanization is a challenge for any country. Developed countries face fewer daunting challenges than developing countries because of rapid and unplanned urbanization 
Bangladesh is facing rapid urbanization for the last three decades 
The application of Remote Sensing (RS) and the Geographic Information System (GIS) have provided opportunities to estimate LULC changes and the LST distribution in a particular region 
Located in the Northeastern region of Bangladesh, Rajshahi District is an agricultural-based region and well-connected with all over Bangladesh. In the last decade, industrial growth, availability of better educational institutions and job opportunities have attracted people to migrate to this region. The growing pressure of the population accelerates the unplanned expansion in this region. Methods comprising the use of the CA and ANN algorithms can demonstrate useful findings in studying the short and long-term consequences of the LULC and LST change in this region. It can also support decision-makers and urban planners in abating the UHI effect. The current study is a regional scale study and the first of its kind in Bangladesh's northwest region, to determine the past  | Study area profile: Rajshahi district located in the northwestern region of Bangladesh, between 24 12 0 to 24 42 0 N latitude and 88 15 0 to 88 50 0 E longitude (Figure 
Various monsoons define this region's climate, bringing moderate rainfall, high humidity and temperature. Seasons in the region are divided into four distinct groups: winter (with low rainfall, high temperatures, and high humidity) from October to February; summer (with minimal rainfall, high temperatures, and high humidity) from March to June; and monsoon (with heavy rainfall, moderate temperatures, and high humidity) from July to September 
However, despite the fact that the district is known as an agrarian region, industrialization reaches a high point in this region following the completion of the Jamuna Bridge in 1998  | Data & methodology:  | Data set and processing approach: The study was directed based on primary and secondary data. Primary data collected from field visits, Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), and Key Informants Interviews (KIIs). The secondary data comprise of multi-temporal Landsat 4-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite images obtained from US Geological Survey (USGS) website (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov)   | Impacts iof iLULC iChange: Observed iany ichange iin iland iUses iduring ithe ilast i20 iyears? i i i i i i i Yes No i i i i i i I i don't i know In iyour iopinion, iis ithe ichange isignificant iin iRajshahi iregion? i i i i i i i Yes i i i i i i No i i i i i i I i don't i know What iare ithe ichanges iin iland iuse iyou ihave inoticed iin ipast itwo iyears i(check iall ithe iapply)? i i i i i Decreasei ini agricultural i landi i i i i i Increase i of i roads i i i i i i Increase i of buildings i i i i i i iIncrease iof iindustries i i i i iIncrease iin iagricultural iland i i i i i i i No i change i in i infrastructures i i i i i i i Demolition i of i infrastructures In iyour iopinion, iwhat iwill ibe ithe iimpact iof ithis ichange iin iland iuse? i i i i iPositive i i i i iNegative i i i i i iI ihave ino iidea ground truth data for accuracy assessment of classified LULC maps. In addition, 10 FGDs (Table 
The questionnaires of FGDs and KIIs were demonstrated in Table 
Based on the output of the discussion, a sustainable future land use management plan was proposed for the study area. The KIIs and FGDs (8-10 participants) consisted of urban planners, agricultural officers, environmental engineers, policymakers, local community leaders, and decisionmakers. Information and opinions regarding the impacts of LULC change on seasonal LST, influences of seasonal LST variations on the agricultural sector and climate change, and preparation of proposed land use management plan were collected during the FGDs and KIIs. The outputs from FGDs and KIIs have been discussed in section 4.8 and 4.9. | Classification of LULC maps: Imagery from the Landsat satellite was classified into four broad LULC classes, including i) built-up area (industrial/residential/commercial area and transportation network); (b) agriculture land (green lands, agricultural lands, and vegetation); (c) water bodies (rivers, wetlands, reservoirs, canals, and streams; (d) bare land (fallow land, sand, playground, landfill sites, and vacant soil) for 1999, 2009, and 2019 using the SVM algorithm in ENVI 5.3 software. The SVM is a sophisticated supervised classification technique based on statistical learning theory which mostly results in accurate classification if the data are complex or noisy  | Validation of classified LULC maps: Around 40 samples were collected for each LULC class in order to produce the LULC maps. The accuracy of the classified maps was evaluated through 100 field level and 300 Google Earth image random sampling ground truth data. For accuracy assessment, the overall accuracy (equation  | Estimation of seasonal LST: The seasonal (summer and winter) LST was estimated using Landsat thermal band images from 1999, 2009, and 2019. Landsat sensors accumulate thermal data and Digital Numbers (DN). For the available data, these DN were converted to LST with four steps process illustrated in Figure 
The Landsat 8 has two thermal bands (band 10 and band 11) centred at 10.9 Œºm and 12 Œºm. Therefore, LST for Landsat 8 was estimated from both bands and then combined by using cell statistics to determine the final LST. | Variation of seasonal LST over LULC classes: For estimating the summer and winter season LST distribution over different LULC categories, ""zonal statistics tool as table"" under spatial analyst tools was used in ArcGIS 10.6 software. This tool summarizes LULC classes' values within the zones of the seasonal LST dataset and reports the results into a table. After adding zone layers (Figure  | Predicting LULC change for the years 2029 and 2039: The CA model was used to identify the future LULC changing pattern in the study region using QGIS's MOLUSCE plugin. During prediction, the CA model considers all the static and dynamic aspects of changes in every LULC category and provides an excellent accurate result  | Predicting LST change for years 2029 and 2039: The seasonal LST was predicted for the years 2029 and 2039 using the ANN algorithm in MATLAB software. The ANN is an effective approach that helps in time series prediction using previous year datasets 
For LST prediction, five layers (LULC images, NDBI, NDBSI, latitude, and longitude) were used as input supporting parameters, and LST images were used as output parameters. These supportive layers are essential as because they influence outcomes by allowing the network to manifest non-linear behavior. During this analysis, the initial learning rate (Œº) was set at 0.1, and the rate of decay (Œ≤) was used to monitor it. The standard rate of decay ranges between 0 and 1 (0 < Œ≤ < 1)  | Ethics: Consent was obtained from respondents prior to the FGDs and KIIs, and they remained anonymous. All contributors were informed of the study's specific objectives before beginning to complete the KIIs and FGDs questionnaire. Participants were only required to complete the questionnaire once, and they were free to stop it whenever they wanted. The relevant authority approved this study's ethical credentials (Rajshahi City Corporation, Rajshahi, Bangladesh). The privacy and confidentiality of the data were ensured. These KIIs and FGDs interviews were conducted according to established ethical guidelines of the concerned authority and the authors confirm that the respondents were informed of the study's specific objectives before beginning to answer the FGDs and KIIs questions. | Result and discussion: This section describes the results estimated from the methodology presented in section 3. The LULC changes, seasonal LST variations, distribution of LST over different LULC classes, prediction of future LULC and seasonal LST, and LST change impacts on agricultural productivity, and future sustainable land use management plan will be discussed in the following section 4. | Variation of past patterns of LULC (1999-2019): The trend of changes in LULC classes estimated from Landsat images using the SVM algorithm for the years 1999 (Figure 
In addition, to understand the extent of LULC changes, the area-wise distribution of LULC classes are presented in Table 
The data showed an unprecedented increase in the built-up area while a noticeable decrease in the amount of agricultural land and water bodies available for use. The primary reason for this is the rapid and unplanned urbanization that has taken place. Agriculture lands and water bodies were dynamically transformed into impervious infrastructures in order to meet the demands of a rapidly expanding population. Farmers are forced to cultivate their land more intensively as a result of the reduction in agricultural land, which increases the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, which contributes to pollution of the air, water, land, and other elements of the environment  | Changing pattern of seasonal LST: Thermal bands of Landsat images were used to estimate the seasonal (summer and winter) variation in LST distribution in the study region from 1999 to 2019. The illustration of summer and winter LST are shown in Figures 
The summer season's LSTs distribution in the study area is shown in Figure 
The Winter season's LST distribution in the study area is illustrated in Figure  | Validation of estimated seasonal LST: LST estimation using RS techniques requires weather-free and cloudfree images. The LST estimation of summer and winter seasons was performed using Landsat 4-5 TM and 8 OLI thermal bands for the years 1999, 2009 and 2019. Well-established equations were used to retrieve LST, however, it agonizes with certain limitations. Cloud coverage in an image can cause the values of LST analysis to be overestimated or underestimated. Additionally, none of the surface materials have a unique emissivity value in a particular area 
In order to validate the estimated LST summer and winter values from RS data, the maximum and minimum temperature data for 1999, 2009 and 2019 were collected from BMD (Tables 
The highest and lowest deviation was observed in the summer season for 1999's maximum and minimum temperatures: -3.27 C and 1.13 C. Besides, the deviated maximum and minimum values were -2.81 C and -0.2 C for 2009. For 2019, the maximum and minimum values were -0.52 C and 1.17 C, respectively. Overall, the summer season's average maximum and minimum deviations were -1.07 C, -1.505 C, and 0.325 C for 1999, 2009, and 2019, as shown in Table 
In the winter season, the highest and lowest deviations were also observed for 1999's maximum and minimum temperatures, which were √æ0.46 C and -0.7 C. Hence, these maximum and minimum deviated values were -8.15 C and -2.15 C for 2009. For 2019, the maximum and minimum values were -1.07 C and -6.69 C, respectively. Overall, the winter season's average deviation was -0.12 C, -5.15 C, and -3.88 C for 1999, 2009, and 2019, as shown in Table 
Taking all the limitations of RS-derived LST data into account, the small difference between estimated and recorded in LST can be accepted and used for further analysis, as well as the prediction of LST in the area of the study. | Variation of seasonal LST in different LULC class: Estimated mean seasonal LST distribution in different LULC classes were calculated using the zonal statistics tool in ArcGIS 10.6 software (Figure 
The variation of the winter season's mean LST in different LULC classes is also demonstrated a significant change (Figure 
The variation of seasonal mean LST over different LULC types provides better insights about the contribution of the built-up area in LST increase by replacing the agricultural and water bodies into hardscape areas. Rapid urban development, climate change, and global warming significantly contribute to the temperature rise. Massive infrastructural development increases the proportion of impervious and paved surfaces, which retained more energy and radiated more heat  | Prediction of future LULC scenarios: The CA algorithm was used to predict the LULC change for 2029 (Figure 
Comparing the predicted LULC scenarios (2029 and 2039) to the 2019 result, it was revealed that almost 58.03 km 2 (2.44 %) and 79.90 km 2 (3.35 %) of the study area will be turned into built-up areas in 2029 and 2039, respectively. Hence, a significant decrease in agricultural land (-1.50 % and -5.93 %) and water bodies (-0.47 % and -2.24 %) were also identified in 2029 and 2039, respectively. The highest positive net change was estimated in built-up (√æ1.16 % and √æ1.53 %) areas, where the largest negative change was identified in water bodies (-0.98 % and -7.40 %) for the year 2029 and 2039, respectively (Table 
Figures 
The increasing LST trend will affect the thermal capacity of LULC categories and contribute to the UHI effect  | Limitations of the CA and ANN models: While CA and ANN models provide an effective framework for evaluating and forecasting LULC and LST situations, the models are more accurate when the previous LULC and LST dynamics pattern remains consistent or stable. Therefore, the CA model is not always enough to make explicit spatial LULC predictions 
Regardless of their shortcomings, dynamic models effectively establish assumptions of land cover and surface temperature changes in any location. As a result, techniques such as LULC, LST change, and prediction mapping are rapidly gaining recognition as highly effective tools for managing critical natural resources and mitigating environmental consequences, particularly in the developing world. Significant LULC changes have occurred in the Rajshahi region during the past 20 years. The total area of agricultural lands was decreased by 8.27 % from 1999 to 2019, while the built-up area was increased by 7.81 %. From the FGDs and KIIs, it was found that the changes in LULC classes create substantial negative impacts on socio-economic and environmental aspects in the study area. Considering the socio-economic impacts, conversion of farmland or agricultural land to infrastructure development decreases the number of lands available for food production. Soil erosion, desertification, and other soil degradation associated with intensive agriculture productivity reduce land resource quality and hamper food productivity. Categories of LULC changes, especially the loss of natural resources (agricultural land and water bodies), create environmental effects by adding loss in biodiversity, destroy habitats that support biodiversity, increase greenhouse effects and surface temperature, disturbs the hydrological cycle and increase surface runoff, soil erosion, and flooding. During the FGDs, participants also mentioned that one of the primary causes of water pollution in the study region is runoff from agricultural land, which contains fertilizer used by farmers during agricultural production. The participants suggested an effective policy measure while preparing the land use management plan (discussed in 4.9) to control water pollution for the increment of food productivity in the future. | Impacts of temperature change: The study area is an agrarian-based region, and variations in seasonal temperature have significant negative and positive impacts on crop yields. Seasonal temperature change have increased the atmospheric CO 2 and frequency/intensity of extreme weather events. The participants from FGDs and KIIs stated that crop productivity due to the fertilization effect induced by an increase in the concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere, expansion of the available areas for growing the tropical and subtropical crops, development of two-crop farming due to an extended cultivation time and reduction of damage to winter crops by low temperatures are the main positive impacts of temperature rise. Besides, negative impacts of seasonal temperature rise include a decline in the number and quality of crops as a consequence of the low growth cycle for high-temperature rises, decrease in the sugar content and fruit store stability, poor coloring, rising weeds, and harmful insects in crops and decreasing soil productivity (Figure 
According to the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation, ""Boro rice"" production will significantly be decreased from 13.5 % to 2.6 % in upcoming years, with an increase of 2 C mean temperature in the study region. Due to the impact of climate change, Bangladesh is facing a 4 C temperature increase in the last decades, resulting 28 % and 68 % reduction in rice and wheat production  | Impacts of climate change: Climate change is causing organic changes in the study area, such as fertilization and breeding in the livestock sector as well as influencing the growing pattern of pastures. During the FGDs and KIIs, a significant relationship was established between the regional economy (mainly depends on agricultural products) and climate change in the study area mentioned in Figure  | Future sustainable land use management plan: Effective land management is a proactive strategy for mitigating the negative consequences of natural land cover change and unplanned regional development. Government officials and policymakers must conduct an extensive study of current conditions and trend analysis of LULC changes on both spatial and temporal scales in order to develop a sustainable land use management plan. Measuring effective land use management practices frequently necessitates an accurate understanding of current and historical trends in LULC change. The trend analysis of LULC changes would aid in conserving natural resources and mitigating the adverse effects of these transformation in the study region. The following issues should be considered when preparing a regional-level land use management plan, based on the discussion during FGDs. The issues are as follows: i. Ensuring the best possible use with restricting misuse and inappropriate use of bare land and water bodies. ii. Safeguarding the gradual decreasing trend of agricultural land with strict rules and regulations to feed up the growing population, increase economic enlargement, and conserve biodiversity. iii. Introducing and monitoring the zoning technique in order to make demarcation of natural resources (agricultural land and water bodies) according to rational criteria for effective utilization in various purposes. iv. Preventing water and soil pollution for ensuring better agricultural productivity and environmental friendly land utilization. v. Ensuring sustainable urban development by preparing a regional level master plan for planned and inclusive urbanization. vi. Increasing plantation, green cover, and established artificial leaks to mitigate the seasonal heat weaves. | Conclusion: This study's main focus is to estimate and predict the land use transformation and their impacts on seasonal surface temperature variations in the agricultural-based region Rajshahi, Bangladesh. The analysis revealed that the study region has been going through a significant loss in agricultural land and expecting more in upcoming years. This study also identified the impacts of land cover change, temperature increase, and climate change on the agricultural sector using FGDs and KIIs. Finally, based on experts' opinions and considering the consequences of unplanned infrastructural development, reduction in green cover, and climate change, this study proposed a sustainable land use management plan for Bangladesh's northwest region.
The LULC analysis demonstrates a significant increase in the built-up area with a net increase of √æ7.81 % from 1999 to 2019. Meanwhile, agricultural land and water bodies were decreased by -8.27 % and -4.75 % from 1999 to 2019. More than 29 % and 28 % of the total area were recorded in the temperature range of 32 C -< 35 C and 29 C -< 32 C in 2019 in winter season, which was 3.64 % and 0 % in year 1999, respectively. The seasonal LST distribution over different LULC classes revealed that the highest temperature was recorded in the built-up area while the lowest temperature was recorded in water bodies and agricultural land for the studied years. The prediction of LULC and LST changes indicates alarming results for 2029 and 2039. More than 23 % (2029) and 50 % (2039) of the total area will likely be experienced high temperatures in the summer season of greater than 35 C. For predicted winter LST, more than 3 % and 13 % of the area will likely be experienced in the high-temperature zone (! 35 C) for 2029 and 2039, respectively, which is comparatively high considering the winter season.
Based on this study's results and discussion, Rajshahi's local government and urban planners can consider unplanned and haphazard development in and out of the city area and formulation of increasing LST as a burning issue of this region. The inclusion of these study outputs in a regional level master/development plan will make Rajshahi District ecologically and environmentally sustainable and able to mitigate the possible impacts of climate change and global warming on agricultural productivity and food security in this region. The study also focuses on the importance of agricultural land, green cover, and natural resources and conservation approach by proposed land use management plan to minimize the UHI effect to reduce the climate change impact. Further research may focus on human-environment interactions to better understanding the causes and consequences associated with urban growth, LULC transformation, and LST change. Urban growth, changes in land cover, and surface temperature in other Bangladesh cities should be reviewed and predicted for future sustainable development. The results will improve the understanding of city planners and policymakers in making a district-level sustainable land use management and development plan for ensuring environmental sustainability at the regional level. | Declarations: for proofreading the manuscript.

Environmental and Sustainability Indicators,Demelash Malede; Tena Alamirew; Job Kosgie; Gebrie Tesfa; Andualem,"Changes in land use/land cover (LULC) are a global environmental concern that has a significant impact on sustainable land and water resource management and development as well as hydrological processes. The primary driving forces of LULC changes in developing countries are population pressure, demand for firewood collection and construction material, shortage of cultivated land, land tenure insecurity, and deforestation. Focusing on the Ethiopian Birr river watershed, the study investigates changes in LULC trends, extents, and magnitudes over the last 32 years using geospatial technologies such as Landsat images of 1986, 2001, and 2018. The supervised land use land cover classification technique was applied to classify the LULC classes using the maximum likelihood algorithm technique. Between 1986 and 2018, agricultural land increased significantly from 56.39% to 70.19%, while settlements increased from 0.73%) to 1.42%. On the other hand, bushlands, forest areas, and grasslands LULC classes in the study area decreased from 26.18% to 19.30%, 4.94%-1.92%, and 11.77%-7.16%, respectively. The findings suggest that integrated watershed management and land use planning should be concerned and implemented in the Birr River watershed.","Introduction: Changes in land use/land cover (LULC) are the conversion of different land-use classes to the earth's terrestrial surface, which are typically the outcome of complicated interactions between the natural environment and anthropogenic processes 
Agricultural expansion is responsible for almost 90% of global ‚òÜ All authors have approved the manuscript and agree with its submission to the journal. All authors approved the final version of the manuscript and agree to be accountable for all aspects of this work.
deforestation, which has a much greater impact than previously believed 
LULC changes have a variety of negative socio-economic and environmental consequences, including decreased agricultural yield, increased vulnerability to natural hazards (flood, drought, fires), altered ecosystem services, and surface runoff trends 
Deforestation and agricultural land encouragement are the primary causes of land degradation, particularly in Ethiopian highlands and marginal land 
The dynamics of LULC change extent, magnitude, and trends are changing and are strongly linked to natural resource overexploitation; this process is governed by climate, soil characteristics, vegetation density, topography, and natural hazards  | Materials and methods:  | Study area: The Birr River watershed is situated in the northwestern highlands of Ethiopia. Geographically, the Birr watershed is located between the longitude of 37 ‚Ä¢ 10 π and 38 ‚Ä¢ 50 π E and the latitude of 10 ‚Ä¢ 30 π and 11 ‚Ä¢ 10 π N. The watershed's elevation ranges between 1691 and 4084 m above the mean sea level (Fig. 
There are six major soil types found in the Birr River watershed, which include Haplic Alisols, Eutric Fluvisols, Haplic Luvisols, Eutrc Leptosols, Haplic Nitisols, and Eutric Vertisols (Fig.  | Data acquisition and processing: Satellite imagery from 1986, 2001, and 2018 was used to identify the changing pattern of LULC in the Birr River watershed (Fig. 
Each Landsat image is processed using the earth resource data analysis system (ERDAS) imagine 2015 software. The ERDAS imagine 2015 software is important by increasing the productivity of simplifying for classifications, orthorectification, mosaicking, reprojection, map production, and change detection  | The LULC classes: Because of the prevalent land covers, the spectral responses of features on Landsat images, extensive field observation, and a literature review, the Birr River watershed was divided into five major LULC classes or types that were generated namely; agricultural, bushland, forest, grassland, and settlement (Table  | Accuracy assessment of LULC classification: The accuracy assessment of a classified image is important for analyzing LULC changes and determining the classification process's acceptability. A total of 250 reference data points were used to ensure that all five LULC classes were adequately represented based on their proportional area. The reference ground truth data was chosen in such a way that it appears in both the Landsat images for the respective period of 1986, 20021, and 2018 and the google earth map. Additionally, the validation of land use types with local datasets, and visual inspections were used and adapted to retrieve the reference data. The producer's accuracy (PA), user's accuracy (UA), overall accuracy (OA), and kappa coefficient (K) was used to evaluate the LULC classification accuracy, which is comprised of a 'confusion matrix' or 'error matrix'  | Overall Accuracy =: Total Number of Correctly Classified Pixels (Diagonal) Total Number of Reference pixels √ó 100
(1) Kappa coefficient statistics criteria agreements are as follows: poor when Kappa <0.4, good when 0.4 < kappa <0.7, and excellent when k > 0.75 
A post-classification was performed using each classified Landsat image. Then, each classified LULC map from  | Trends of LULC change analysis: The significance of LULC change trend analysis is that determines which land use class or type is transitioning to other land uses  | Rate of change: where A2 is the area of LULC (km 2 ) in period 2, A1 is the area of LULC (km 2 ) in period 1, and Z is the period interval in years between A2 and A1. | Results:  | Analysis of LULC classification: In the Birr River watershed, five major LULC types (agricultural land, bushland, forest, grassland, and settlements) were used during the   
Similarly, in 2001 the majority of LULC classes were agriculture and Bushland, which covered an area of 849.90 km 2 (61.99%) and 326.35 km 2 (23.80%), respectively. Forest, grassland, and settlements occupied an area of 24.23 km 2 (1.77%), 154.26 km 2 (11.25%), and 16.25 km 2 (1.19%), respectively, during the same period. Furthermore, 2018 LULC classification types also indicate that agriculture and bushland comprise the greatest share of all other LULC classes, which occupied 962.34 km 2 (70.19%) and 154.26 km 2 (19.30%), respectively, while forest, grassland, and settlements LULC classes occupied an area of 26.39 km 2 (1.92%), 98.22 km 2 (7.16%), and 19.40 km 2 (1.42%), respectively (Table 
Agriculture and bushland covered the largest area in the watershed than the other LULC types in all three years 
The LULC map from 1986, 2001, and 2018 were used to assess the classified accuracy. Based on the accuracy of 1986, 2001, and 2018 LULC maps, the overall accuracies were 90.69, 91.01, and 92.22% respectively, while kappa coefficients were 0.87, 0.88, and 0.89 respectively. Therefore, these results indicate that the classified map and ground truth LULC classes were agreed upon. The classified map also established the minimum accuracy required for the subsequent postclassification operations  | Extent and rate of LULC change: For three time periods, the extent and rates of changes for each LULC were summarized below: 1986, 2001, and 2018 (Tables 
In addition, the extent and rate of change in LULC between 201 and 2018 were presented in (Table 
The extent and rate of LULC change patterns from 1986 to 2018 are also presented in (Table  | Trend of LULC changes: The agricultural land and settlements revealed an increasing trend increasing from 79.86 km 2 to 189.30 km 2 and 6.29 km 2 -9.44 km 2 for    the period 1986 to 2018, respectively. On the other hand, forest, bushland, and grasslands showed a decreasing trend from 1986 to 2018 (Fig.  | LULC change matrix: The LULC change matrix depicts the distribution of main transitions in the five LULC classes used in the study area over the study period (1986-2018) (Table  | Discussion: This study showed five major LULC classes (i.e., agricultural land, bushland, forest land, grassland, and settlements) in the Birr River watershed (Fig. 
The findings of the study revealed that LULC has changed over the last 32 years  in the BirrRiver watershed. Agricultural and settlements have grown significant expansion in the study watershed, increasing by 24.49% and 54.78%, respectively during this period . In contrast, for this period, bushland, forest, and grassland have decreased by 26.27%, 61.01%, and 39.14%, respectively (Table 
Changes in LULC and their dynamics are directly related to biodiversity and land productivity and have huge environmental and societal effects 
Thus, from the grassroots to government levels, sustainable integrated watershed planning, management, and development should be applied and implemented, with close supervision of area afforestation, reforestation, and conservation of the existing watersheds forest, bushland, and grasslands. Furthermore, soil and water conservation on the degraded land, controlling the further expansion of cultivated land, and fuelwood and charcoal production demands. | Conclusion: This study investigated how LULC changed and its dynamics in the Birr River watershed in the last 3 decades (1986-2018) using geospatial technologies.

"Analysis of Land Use/land Cover Changes and Prediction of Future Changes With Land Change Modeler: Case of Belek, Turkey",Halil Akdeniz,"In the areas declared to be a tourism center, a rapid tourism-related development occurs depending on the investments in tourism, which causes a dramatic land use and land cover changes. Determining, monitoring, and modeling of land use and land cover changes are required in order to ensure the conservation-use balance and sustainability within such vulnerable areas that are under the development pressure. This study consists of four steps. In the rst step, the Landsat images dated 1985, 2000, and 2021 were classi ed using the maximum likelihood method and the land use and land cover of Belek Tourism Center located in Turkey were determined. The second step included the identi cation of areal and spatial changes between the land use and land cover classes for the periods between 1985 and 2000, 2000 and 2021, and 1985 and 2021.  In the third step, the land use and land cover changes in Belek Tourism Center for 2040 were modeled using the Land Change Modeler. Last step evaluated the relationship between the modeled spatial development pattern and the current planning decisions. According to the results obtained through a 36-year research, the rates of settlement, forest, and water body areas have increased by 11.91%, 13.67%, and 0.82%, respectively whereas the rates of barren land and agricultural areas have reduced by 22.25% and 4.15%, respectively. The land use map modeled for 2040 predicts the settlement areas to expand by 5.46% and the agricultural areas to shrink by 4.21% by comparison with 2021.","Introduction: Changes of the land use and land cover consist of a complex and dynamic process that occurs under the in uence of natural or anthropogenic activities, affecting the entire ecosystem. Constituting an important part of the ecosystem and being one of the primary scarce resources, coastal areas require planned development to ensure their sustainability and conservation-use balance. These ecologically vulnerable areas should be monitored for their change process over time and their land use models for future should be generated.
A sustainable development requires settlement systems to be comprehensively analyzed and modeled 
In this regard, management and land use policies should be developed for the sustainability of the areas, depending on the urbanization-oriented land use changes 
Numerous studies addressing the inclusion of spatial planning policies into land use change models exist in the literature 
Recently, understanding the concept of the land use system and modeling the changes in the LULC to take necessary measures against potential future problems have been among the most commonly discussed topics. Using the previous classi cation maps, it is possible to form a model to predict the trends regarding the changes in the LULC for a certain period of time. Formation of these change models is a necessity to predict the classes that have a dominant role in the future changes in land use and land cover and in sustainable planning studies that create visions for the urbanization process. These models simplify the group of complex socioeconomic and biophysical factors affecting the rate of changes in the LULC and provide the prediction of the effects of these changes 
A number of studies used the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing This study aims to discuss the policies for spatial planning by examining the relationship between current planning decisions and the spatial development pattern created by the future simulation that is formed based on the monitoring of the changes in land use and the current trends. It also aims to determine the potential e ciency of the land use modeling in terms of sustainable urban development and, through contributing to the planning process, to underline the effects of the plans on the space's environmental sustainability potential. Therefore, this study differs from other similar studies as it combines different perspectives from different disciplines.
In Turkey, a ""Tourism Center"" and the ""Culture and Tourism Conservation and Development Regions (CTCDR)"" are the regions whose borders are identi ed to conserve and use the areas where historical, natural, and cultural values exist intensively or that have a high potential of tourism potential, and to ensure sectoral and planned development in these areas. In the determination process of these regions, the country's natural, historical, archaeological, and socio-cultural values, winter and water sports, health tourism, and other tourism-related potentials are considered. Investors are provided with support and promotions to ensure the development of tourism in these regions. In the areas declared to be a tourism center, a rapid tourism-related development occurs depending on the investments in tourism, which causes a dramatic land use and land cover (LULC) changes. Being a barren area at rst, the coast has been opened to settlement through investments in tourism. It has also triggered urban development in the coast and the areas behind the coast to meet the service needs of tourism facilities. The development of the second housing concept that is increased due to the need for shelter of the employees working at the tourism facilities and the attractiveness of the area depending on and the investments for infrastructure has also escalated the changes in the LULC. It is critical for decision-makers, planners, practitioners, and researchers to monitor the changes in the LULC in order to ensure the conservation-use balance in such vulnerable areas that are under the pressure of development.
This study determined the changes in the land use and land cover of the Belek region after being declared to be a tourism center, modeled the changes in the LULC for 2040, and assessed the relationship between this model and planning decisions. | Materials And Methods:  | Study steps: This study consisted of four steps and aimed to determine the changes in the LULC of Belek Tourism Center, to simulate the land use and land cover model for 2040, and to assess the relationship between the model and the planning decisions. -The fourth step included the comparison between the planning decisions for Belek Tourism Center, the changes in the LULC from past to present, and the model for 2040, and the assessment of the relationship between the spatial development pattern which was formed through this comparison and the current planning decisions. | Study area: Belek Tourism Center, which is determined to be the study area, is located in the district of Serik in Antalya, Turkey. There are a total of 170 tourism centers declared by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism in Turkey. With its twenty-two tourism centers, Antalya has the highest number of tourism centers in Turkey. Belek Tourism Center is thirty kilometers away from the center of Antalya and is one of the tourism centers with the oldest date of declaration in the region (Declaration Date: 
Belek Tourism Center is located in the south of Turkey between the north latitude of 36¬∞ 54' 3"" -36¬∞ 50' 28"" and the east longitude of 30¬∞ 55' 34"" -31¬∞ 07' 08"". Tourism center has Aksu River on the west, Acƒ±su River on the east, Mediterranean on the south, and the Antalya-Alanya highway on the north (Fig. 
Belek Tourism Center is 6,336.7 hectares and its length of coastline is approximately twenty kilometers. The built-up areas of Kadriye and Belek are located in this tourism center. The total population of these built-up areas is 16,191 for 2020. Belek Tourism Center has forty-seven hotels, fteen golf courses, and various social and cultural facilities. It hosts approximately 1.5 million visitors from different regions of the world every year and is the leading tourism center that attracts the highest number of tourists in Turkey.
Belek Tourism Center is one of the most important seventeen nesting sites in Turkey for loggerheads (caretta caretta) which are classi ed as an endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Natura (IUCN). One study performed by the Belek Tourism Investors Union (BETUYAB) with several universities has indicated that Belek Tourism Center has 109 bird species, one endemic sh species (Aphanius anatoliae), and a total of 574 plant species belonging to 104 families including twenty-nine endemic families and one relict endemic family (Serik Pear) 
The study area has low values of altitude and slope, ranging from zero meter to thirty-seven meters and from 0% to 5%. It has a Mediterranean climate with hot and dry in summers and warm and rainy in winters. The mean yearly temperature of the study area is 18.8 ¬∫C. Belek Tourism Center has a total of 285 sunny days in one year and welcomes its visitors every season thanks to its climate. The dominant vegetation in the study region is dune vegetation and stone pine forests along the coasts and maquis and shrubs in the inland areas.
Forests, especially stone pine trees (Pinus pinea) and Turkish pine trees (Pinus buritia), are created to prevent sand dunes in the eastern and western parts of the study region and cover a large area  | Determination of the land use and land cover of Belek Tourism Center from past to present:  | Data acqusition: Data used in this study were acquired through various resources. In order to determine the land use/land cover of the study area, satellite images from the Landsat 5 TM dated 1985, the Landsat 7 ETM dated 2000, and the Landsat 8 OLI dated 2021 were used (Table 
The LULC classes in this study were determined considering the land cover classi cation system identi ed by the Europe Environment Agency (EEA) and the characteristics of the region. The LULC was classi ed into ve groups as agriculture, barren, built-up area, forest, and water body. Table 
For each sub-model, driver variables were identi ed as inputs to predict LC maps 
variable was included in this study because regions that are surrounded by built-up areas but have not been opened for settlement yet have higher probability to turn into a built-up area within years. The distance to river limits the urban sprawl. The distance to road networks has a key role in urban sprawl as it facilitates the access to daily needs. Distance to built-up area and distance to road networks are modeled as a dynamic variable because they change and develop in the course of time. | Change prediction: Change prediction is analyzed using the Markov Chain model and the Cellular Automata (CA) algorithm. The Markov Chain model is a stochastic model used to predict land use and land cover. This model predicts the LULC starting from a t=1 time to another t+1 time depending on the transition area matrix and the transition probability matrix between the LULC classes. The Markov Chain does not solely su ce by itself to predict the LULC changes because it does not take the spatial distribution of the LULC classes and the spatial aspect of growth into consideration 
The CA includes a regular grid of cells that manage how each cell's neighbors affect the future class of each cell 
The LULC data belonging to two different periods of time,
The transition area matrix generated using the Markov Chain model,
The transition potential map created using the MCA method,    | Change analysis: The LULC changes of Belek Tourism Center were grouped into three periods as 
It was found that the expansion in the built-up areas were mostly arisen from the agricultural and barren areas, whereas the expansion in the forests were mostly arisen from the barren area. In this period, 392.78 hectares from agricultural areas and 201.2 hectares from barren areas were transformed into built-up areas. A total of 569.31 hectares from barren areas was transformed into forests. No changes were observed in the area with 6,517.67 hectares.
-During the 36-year period (1985-2021), the biggest change was detected in barren areas. Barren areas shrunk by 22.25% in this period. Agricultural areas also shrunk by 4.15%. An expansion was noted in forests by 13.67%, in built-up areas by 11.91%, and in water body areas by 0.82% during this 36-year period. Of the expansion in the built-up areas, 452.73 hectares were arisen from agricultural areas and 503.86 hectares were arisen from barren areas. Similarly, the expansion in the forests were mostly arisen from barren areas Table 
Following the selection of the driver variables, the determined land class transitions were modeled in a single transition sub-model and transition potential maps were generated. The accuracy of the transition potential maps ranged from 40% to 95%.
This study created transition probability matrices for 2021 (using the LULC maps from 1985 and 2000) and 2040 years (using the LULC maps from 2000 and 2021). Table 
A model validation was performed to assess the reliability of the prediction regarding the LULC changes for 2040. During the accuracy analysis of the model, the actual LULC map for 2021 and the simulated LULC map for the same year were compared. The accuracy analysis was conducted using the Kappa statistics and overall accuracy. This analysis calculated the Kappa value as 0.79 and the overall accuracy of classi cation as 0.83. These results indicate that this model may be utilized for the LULC projection of Belek Tourism
Center for 2040 (Kappa coe cient>0.60). Figure 
The statistics for 2040 year predict that of the total area, 30.11% will be agricultural area, 25.25% water body area, 24.78% forest, 19.18% built-up area, and 0.68% barren area. Within the period of 2021 and 2040, it is expected that built-up areas and forests will expand by 5.46% and 1.28%, whereas agricultural areas and barren areas will shrink by 4.21% and 2.56%, respectively. The future changes in the water body areas (0.03%) are predicted to be insigni cant. The results of the transition probability matrix show that the trend of change is expected to be mostly from barren areas to forests and from agricultural areas to built-up areas (Table 
To summarize, this study indicated that the built-up areas in the inland and coastal zones would continue to expand within the next 20 years in the event that the LULC pattern and trend of Belek Tourism Center from to 2021 would be sustained. | Relationship between the LULC modeling for 2040 and planning decisions: The rst planning in the region was conducted by the Scandinavian and Development Associates on behalf of the State Planning Organization within the scope of the West Mediterranean (an international project) in 1967. Being known as the Ole Helweg Plan or the Western Antalya Project, this planning is considered the rst tourism master plan in Turkey and covers a 1,000-kilometer part of the coastal area in Muƒüla and Antalya. This planning assessed the analysis of the tourism potential of the coastal areas in Antalya and Muƒüla, the infrastructure and superstructure studies, determination of the development areas, and preparation of the master plans. The Belek region was chosen as one of the primary development areas within the plan. Its total number of beds was determined to be 5,000 
The Law for the Encouragement of Tourism (law no: 2634) that was put into force in 1982 in Turkey allowed the ongoing developments in the tourism industry to be supported with the legislation, the terms ""tourism area, tourism region, and tourism center"" to be added in the tourism planning terminology, and the mass tourism to rapidly increase. In accordance with this law, Belek was declared to be a tourism center in 1984.
The border of the tourism center was determined by excluding the built-up areas (Kumk√∂y, Kadriye, Belekk√∂y) in 1984. After being declared to be a tourism center, the region raised its bed capacity to 13,000 (Acar ƒ∞nam, 2009). Belek Tourism Center was announced to be a tourism investment area in 1986. Within the same year, the Belek Tourism Center Land Use Plan (1/25,000) was approved. This plan separated Belek Tourism Center into two regions as east and west 
The land use plan dated 1986 showed that land uses were arranged for their intended purpose, zoning method was used to determine the borders of tourism-related development, natural values were conserved, and the needs of the local community were taken into consideration (regional park).
The Serik-Manavgat-Antalya Environmental Plan (1/25,000), the rst environmental plan for this region, was approved in 1981. In 1990, the Serik-Manavgat-Antalya Environmental Plan was revised, and the Eastern Antalya Environmental Plan (1/25,000) was approved. In 2002, a planning revision was made for Belek Tourism Center and its surroundings through the Eastern Antalya Environmental Plan Belek Revision (1/25,000). A number of revisions were performed on the same plan in 
The latest arrangement regarding Belek Tourism Center and its surroundings is the Antalya-Burdur-Isparta
Planning Region Environmental Plan in 2014 (1/100,000) and the revisions made on this plan in 2019 and 2022 (Fig.  | Discussion: When the reasons for the changes given in Table 
-Within the aforementioned period, changes in the water body areas (0.82%) were determined to be insigni cant. This partial expansion in the water body areas was due to the construction of arti cial ponds with landscape in golf courses.
-The forests were the land use class with the highest rate of growth between 1985 and 2021 (13.67%). The planting works which were conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to prevent sand and coastal erosions were effective in the expansion of the forests. A transformation from barren areas to forests occurred through these planting works. The state-owned area in the Kumk√∂y coast was declared to be a ""strictly protected sensitive area"" and was not opened to be a tourism facility. The predicted LULC map of the study area for 2040 shows that the entire coastline except for the conserved areas will be opened to settlement through tourism. The predicted LULC map for 2040 indicates that a large part of the urban growth expected to occur between 2021 and 2040 will serve as an extension of the built-up areas in 2021, and that this growth will be in the core of the built-up areas (Belek, Kadriye).
The planning decisions and land use changes regarding Belek Tourism Center and the model for 2040 were compared; then, the relationship between trends and planning decisions was assessed. Integrating the land use simulations into the planning process will guide the decision-makers, practitioners, and planners to assess the accuracy of the decisions made for ensuring the sustainable urban development. The comparison between the planning decisions for Belek Tourism Region and the simulation for 2040 introduced the necessity to limit the current trends in terms of the conservation of the agricultural areas. This output will help manage the urban growth and ensure the conservation-use balance regarding the spatial planning decisions. | Conclusion: The planning decisions and land use changes regarding Belek Tourism Center and the model for 2040 were compared; then, the relationship between trends and planning decisions was assessed.

"Investigating land use land cover changes and their effects on land surface temperature and urban heat islands in Sharqiyah Governorate, Egypt",Asmaa Fahmy; Mohamed Abdelfatah; Gamal El-Fiky,"The Urban Heat Island (UHI) issue is a result of the undesirable effects of urban growth on the environment, such as temperature rises and landscape changes that cause environmental dangers. Thus, the purpose of this research is to investigate the effect of Land Use Land Cover (LULC) change on Land Surface Temperature (LST) and then study UHI in Sharqiyah from 2001 to 2022 using remote sensing data. This data was collected from the Landsat satellite and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 11A Thermal sensors. A Mono-Window Algorithm was used on Landsat 8 and 9 data to estimate the LST. To determine the LST and UHI, the thermal band was utilized. LULC maps were created using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification technique. To evaluate various LULC indices in the Sharqiyah and find their correlation with LST, the spectral indices Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Bare Land Index (NDBaI), and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) were obtained from the processing of multispectral Landsat data. To check data sources, air temperature measurements for Sharqiyah were also acquired. The results show that urban expansion has increased in a noticeable trend. The built-up area increased by 18.9% during the research phase, and the region's mean LST increased within 3.98‚ÑÉ. The UHI threshold temperature increased by 4.27‚ÑÉ. This research is critical for Planning Engineers and environmental scientists to realize LULC variations effects on LST and to suggest suitable political steps to regulate urbanization in Sharqiyah Governorate.","Introduction: One of the main important environmental factors influencing our ecosystems and daily lives is the climate 
Using data from satellites with a medium spatial resolution, such as Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Map-per+ (ETM + ), Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS), and MODIS, a wide range of research on the SUHI phenomenon is carried out. Thermal wavelength satellite sensors can provide spatially complete and time-synchronized coverage of an urban area; in contrast to static stations and vehicle traversal, real higher and lower temperatures across a city region can be achieved 
Also, since the mid-1990 s, several spectral indices, such as, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), and the Normalized Difference Bare Land Index (NDBaI) have been able to be employed for precise and rapid classification from satellite data 
In Egypt, several types of research were performed to better investigate the UHI and its harmful effects on the environment. 2011, and 2022, using Landsat TM and OLI data. To satisfy the purpose of the study, the following data and techniques were employed, and represented as a flowchart as shown in Fig.  | Materials and methods:  | Study area: Sharqiyah Governorate is Egypt's third most popular governorate, covering about 4818 km 2 . Its capital is Zagazig, and the 10th of Ramadan City is one of its largest industrial cities. It is placed in the country's northern region and on the eastern edge of the Nile Delta, between longitudes 31¬∞15 0 and 32¬∞15 0 E, and latitudes 30¬∞10 0 and 31¬∞5 0 N, as shown in Fig.  | Data sources: In the research, Satellite Landsat imagery TM, ETM+, and OLI/ TIRS for each study year  | LULC classification: The bands of Landsat 8 were combined to create a multi-band image, which was subsequently processed to a resolution of 30 m and mapped to the WGS 84/UTM zone 36 N used ArcGIS software. LULC classification means automatically grouping each of the image's cells into different classes of land cover. Different classification strategies have been used in earlier research to classify satellite imagery cells into numerous LULC classes utilizing multi-temporal Landsat satellite imagery 
For the accuracy assessment, sample points of Sharqiyah were chosen using an irregular stratified selection strategy. For all years, several samples were utilized to correlate classified imagery cells with reference points. For each classified image, about 400 earthpoints were collected to examine the precision of the LC classifica- tions. The past Google Earth information was used to get the actual points for the various land cover classes. So, some statistical strategies were used: user's accuracy (UA), which focuses on earth's reality probability, and producer's accuracy (PA), which focuses on classification fitness. Based on these strategies, the overall accuracy (OA) was estimated. Then it was determined using kappa statistics (K), which is a non-parametric indicator developed to assess the degree of similarity between producer and user values. Past research indicated that the required accuracy rate for LULC classification should be set at 80 % (Rousta et al. 2018). | Extraction of different LULC indices: NDVI is the most commonly used criterion for detecting vegetation. NDBaI was used to determine the amount of bare land on the land surface. NDBI is a further important urban climate indication for ecological observation. These three indices can be applied to categorize different types of LULC (Table  | Land surface temperature determination: In the study of the earth's surface dynamics, LST is a significant issue. The Mono-Window Algorithm (MWA) has been used in this paper to extract LST from Landsat satellite data 
Initially, Eq. ( 
Where, L k = sensor radiance, L maxk = maximum radiance of band 6, L mink = minimum radiance of band 6, Q Cal = quantized calibrated pixel value in DN, Q Cal max = max quantized calibrated pixel value in DN, and Q Cal min = min quantized calibrated pixel value in DN.
Where, M L = radiance multiplicative scaling factor, A L = radiance additive scaling factor for band10, Q Cal = pixel value in DN. Eq (3) is applied to adjust for local sun elevation angles for band 1 to band 9, and LST is estimated using band 10 (10.6 lm √Ä11.19 lm) of the Landsat 8 thermal data
h S is scene-center solar elevation angle in degrees, Following the DN transformation, Eq. ( 
Where, K 1 & K 2 are the calibration constants of thermal bands, as shown in Table 
Then, the LST is determined using Eq. ( 
Where k = is the central band wavelength of emitted radiance, BT = Brightness temperature, and e = emissivity (evaluated by using Eq. ( 
Where Pv = proportion of vegetation evaluated by using Eq. ( 
Where NDVI was already estimated. The map of LST distribution over Sharqiyah was created by classifying temperatures into suitable ranges and assigning them colors. | Mapping UHI, Non-UHI: The following equations were used to determine UHI and non-UHI regions 
Where l is the mean LST and r is the standard deviation (STD) of LST in Sharqiyah, respectively. Using (Eq. (  | Results and discussion:  | Land use land cover classification: For this research, SVM was utilized to classify the LULC. The LULC of Sharqiyah is divided into four classes (vegetation, builtup, bare land, and water bodies) based on Landsat pictures for  an increase in the built-up area; furthermore, there is a decline in the vegetation cover. Uncontrolled urbanization due to increasing population, migration to cities, and infrastructure investment depletes natural resources like agricultural areas 
Based on the error matrix used to evaluate the LU/LC maps' quality, the overall accuracy for the years 2001, 2011, and 2022 were 92.53 %, 92 %, and 92.69 %, respectively (Table 
According to Table  | Land surface temperature over different land uses and land covers: As Sharqiyah Governorate is largely covered by vegetation due to its status as an agricultural governorate, the vegetation and water body areas on the map have the least LST, as shown in Fig. 
The statistics of the LST of 2001 show that the mean temperature for the built-up areas in Sharqiyah was 35.28‚ÑÉ. From Fig. 
LST of the vegetation class increased from 2001 to 2011 and showed a significant increase by 2022, predominantly falling within the temperature range of 30-35 ¬∞C, with some small patches observed in the range of 35-40 ¬∞C as shown in Fig.  | Spatiotemporal distribution of LULC indices: The LULC index maps of Sharqiyah are represented in Fig.  | Relationship between LST and LULC indices: Global population growth is one of the reasons for increasing stress on natural environmental supplies and extreme growth in LST, which has a direct impact on LULC properties  | Urban Heat Island distribution: The study's results found that UHI spatial distribution followed virtually the same pattern during the study period. Throughout the study period, Sharqiyah's south part has the highest density of UHI areas, as shown Fig.  | Verification of LST: The LST data must be validated to confirm the validity of the outcomes. We collected data produced from MODIS images. Some difficulties with this form of validation deal with unreliability in accuracy, including the correct measurement of the imagery. To resolve these issues, the NWP for air temperature measurements was utilized. NWP (ERA5, the most recent edition of the Copernicus Climate Change Service's atmospheric reanalysis of global climate) obtained the air temperature values. As a result, the datasets Landsat and MODIS can be used as valid guidelines for the air temper-   | Conclusion: The LST is an essential issue in the climate mechanism on Earth. Landsat-5, Landsat-7, Landsat-8, and Landsat-9 images were collected from the USGS. Using data from Landsat, this research evaluates the LULC and LST during the study period. Urban development and climate variation both lead to a rise in land surface temperature. When we compare vegetation and built-up regions, the built-up area has higher LST values. Landsat imagery data analysis has been researched to estimate the extent of the UHI-impacted region from 2001 to 2022 and the impact of LULC variations on the LST. The LST grew quickly, especially in urban areas and desert/bare land. The utilization of Landsat with the MWA technique produced acceptable results; however, outliers occurred as an outcome of the preprocessing step. Over the study period, the built-up regions rose considerably (10.22 % to 29.12 %). In contrast, vegetation reduced substantially from 66.15 % to 53.39 %, and bare land decreased by 5.63 %. Variations in LULC have also impacted the allocation of land cover regions over time, especially the transition of land cover classes from previously vegetated land to urban zones or towards more bare land. As a result, the distribution of UHI areas has increased over time, while mean LST has risen rapidly with decreasing waterbodies and vegetation. The major goal of this research was to identify variations in LULC and land surface temperature caused by development in Sharqiyah. It was also shown that vegetation and LST have a negative correlation. In contrast, built-up regions and bare land have a positive correlation with LST. The study's findings give a complete knowledge of the causes of growing LST, which are mostly related to increased urbanization and, as a result, the spread of agricultural land encroachment. However, preventing urbanization without a shift in high-level management decisions is difficult. There were several challenges observed when doing the research. For instance, satellite images were collected at different times. If these images had been acquired at the same time, the results would have been more dependable and accurate. An important limitation of this study is that results may be affected when there are partially cloudy conditions, as clouds can cause abnormal values in the data. If the satellite data's geospatial accuracy had been higher, the LC classification would be more accurate. This research has significant implications for future environmental science research. To further investigate the impact of other environmental factors on LULC changes and LST, such as precipitation, humidity, and wind patterns, policymakers and urban planners can make more informed decisions to manage urban growth and minimize its negative impact on the environment and human health. Spectral indices such as Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) can be estimated from surface reflectance data. Advanced remote sensing technologies, such as Sentinel data and radar, can be used to detect and monitor urban areas more accurately, particularly in rapidly urbanizing areas like Sharqiyah, to identify trends and patterns over time with greater accuracy and inform policy decisions to mitigate UHI areas and the negative impacts of urbanization.","Analysis of Urban Heat Island Characteristics and Mitigation Strategies for Eight Arid and Semi-Arid Gulf Region Cities (, 2021) || Assessment of Urban Heat Island Based on the Relationship between Land Surface Temperature and Land Use/Land Cover in Tehran (, , , , 2016) || Remote Sensing Image-Based Analysis of the Relationship between Urban Heat Island and Land Use/Cover Changes (, , , , 2006) || Improving Accuracy of Land Surface Temperature Prediction Model Based on Deep-Learning (, , 2020) || Impervious Surface Growth and Its Inter-Relationship with Vegetation Cover and Land Surface Temperature in Peri-Urban Areas of Delhi (, , , , 2021.

Turkish Journal of Agriculture -Food Science and Technology,Burcu Deƒüerli; Mehmet √áetin,"This is study is based with the support of RS-GIS technology on the land use of Samsun Center, as well as the coastal districts of Ilkadƒ±m,Atakum,Bafra Plain, through the processing and interpretation of satellite images in the summer months of 2000,2010,2020. Spatial and temporal variability properties of LU/LC were determined using MLC algorithm, controlled classification approach. The predictive values of the LU/LC change that will occur in 2030, calculated with the MLP-ANN model based on Machine Learning algorithms and mapped with the QGIS 3.16 program. To determine the accuracy coefficient of the model, 2020 LU/LC simulation performed using the transition potential matrix of 2000 and 2010 LU/LC data. The results of simulation were compared the data of land use land cover with the 2020 to evaluate the accuracy of the simulation model. The model of MLP-ANN provided an accuracy of 72% based on the kappa fit index. According to MLP-ANN model 2030 results were an increase of 73.33 km¬≤ in built up areas, an increase of 56.89 km¬≤ in bare areas, and a decrease of 129.66 km¬≤ in green areas. It provided a reference basis for future Samsun urban to rural coastline LU planning and management and LU structure optimization.","Introduction: Land Use and Cover (LULC) change of the detection and forecast is an important factor for guiding planning, land resource, sustainable development management. Considering the phenological effect and seasonal adaptation, the estimation and detection of the same seasons for different years from LULC maps will greatly benefit 
An urban area is a mosaic of different landscape features or land use (e.g., impermeable surfaces, green areas, residential areas, planting areas, etc.) and has different thermal properties 
Since the 21st century, many studies show that land use change causes natural disasters, energy shortages, food shortages, economic crisis and other social and ecological problems 
The aim of this research is to (i) understand the growth of urban model and its direction, (ii) identify the land usecover changes by determining the possible future growth scenario through simulations in Samsun, one of the most vulnerable and rapidly growing cities of Turkey. The findings obtained from this study are intended to be useful to regional planners by predicting land use in advance in planning the resident and abundant resources of nature in the region by the enhancing demands in the future.
There are studies on land classification using the Remote Sensing method for Samsun. 
When we look at international indexes 
Looking at the literature review, many UA researchers have applied data mining models and different machine learning to predict future the independent UA data and LULC change using dependent. GIS commonly used the models of forecasting are as follows: SLEUTH (slope, land use, exclusion, urban extent, transportation, and hill shade), state and transition simulation model (STSM); land transformation model (LTM); ), CLUE (conversion of land use and its effects), ANN (artificial neural networkcellular automata (CA), Markov chain (MC), land change models (LCM), logistic regression (LR), spatially explicit landscape event simulation ( SELES), and GIS-based weights of evidence (WoE) approach. LU/ LC change for especially aim of predicting for the future was to provide to get useful information to the decision-makers, planning amanagemnet, government officials, and land resource planners, and for taking an effective plan for planning and management in protecting the environment of LU/LC 
This study was evaluated in terms of (i) site selection being on both urban and rural scales in the direction of increasing urbanization, (ii) being based on current data sets (iii) including simulation as well as change analysis (iii) the program used (QGis) and the algorithm used (MLP-ANN) differs from other studies. | Material and Method: Samsun province is coordinate of the 40¬∞ 50'-41¬∞ 51' N, 34¬∞ 25' and 37¬∞ 08' E. It has an area of approximately 9.725 km¬≤ and consists of 17 districts (Anonymous, Accessed on 05.06.2021). According to TUIK 2020 data, the population of Samsun is 1,356,079. Samsun is the 16th largest province of Turkey in terms of population, and it constitutes 17% of the population of the Black Sea Region and 1.6% of the population of Turkey (Anonymous, Retrieved 02.05.2021). It is located in the coastline of middle part of the Black Sea, between the deltas where the rivers of Kƒ±zƒ±lƒ±rmak and Ye≈üilƒ±rmak flow into the Black Sea. Neighbors of the province, in the north of which the Black Sea is located; Sinop in the west, Tokat and Amasya in the south, Ordu in the east, and √áorum in the southwest. Samsun shows three different features in terms of landforms. The first part is the mountainous part in the south; the part of second region is the plateaus between the mountainous part and the coastline, the third; coastal plains between the highlands and the Black Sea 
Samsun has undergone radical changes in the last 50 years as a result of the settlement pressure concentrated on the coastal areas due to urbanization, population growth and socio-economic developments (Anonymous, Accessed: 06.06.2021). After 1998, the urban settlement area in Samsun increased by 96.32% and grew to approximately 32 km¬≤, and this growth generally developed towards agricultural areas. Since 1998, Atakum district has become a second city center 
As the study area selection criteria, the population of Atakum district is 202,618 according to 2018 data; the population of the region of Ilkadim is 332,230, the population of the region of Canik is 97,564. It is seen that the population in the research area increased in the 28-year period between 1990 and 2018, but the increase occurred more in the western direction, which is called Atakum, unlike the 30-year period between 1960 and 1990. When we look at the 2020 TUIK data, the 3rd crowded district of Samsun has been Bafra District, which is located in the western countryside (Figure 
The satellite used in the research are Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS (Collection 2, Level 2), Landsat 7 ETM+ (Collection 1, level 1), satellite data belonging to the summer months of 
The detailed process of LULC modeling covers different stages such as data collection, preprocessing, LULC post-classification analysis, validation, classification, LULC change prediction, spatial variables modeling 
In our study, algorithm of MLC was used to classify for images of satellite. The MLC technique was preferred so that it is the efficient and common classification matrils metha in the literature when the data/locations of correct training are created 
Descriptive statistics properties (mean values for each spectral band and DN (digital number) variances) are determined with the help of spectral signatures. As described in 
Controlled classification typically involves a series of steps (i) identification of training fields, (ii) spectral signature collection, and (iii) image classification 
In this study, MLC-controlled classification was performed with the original satellite data bands (LANDSAT) that produced LU/LC maps for 2000, 2010 and 2020. Then, the LU/LC maps were evaluated using the cross-classification method. The LU/LC 2000-2020 variation was observed using classified map features. A table showing the area in square kilometers was created and the area (km¬≤) for each LU/LC class and the percentage change in the data set were calculated. accuracy assessment is that the confusion matrix statistically obtained from field data (signature file) and the maps of LU/LC was used for 
The classes within the study area were determined as (i) Water (River, Lake, Sea), (ii) Built up (Urban, Roads), (iii) Vegetation (Forest, Cropland, Delta, (iv) Open Land (Bare Soil) 
the future urban LUC of prediction in the determined research area in Samsun, the study includes three main steps: (i) preparation of LULC from satellite images, (ii) preparation of data input for terrain change modeling (iii) modeling of present LULC forecast to calculate future LULC forecast accuracy. Land use and classified images from the years 2000 and 2010 were used to generate a transition potential matrix using the QGIS MOLUSCE tool. NDVI, Distance from river, Dem, Slope were used as additional data for the model. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) which is the map of Elevation made using obtained from the of ALOS PALSAR RTC. The DEM data are extracted for the map of Slope. River networks from DEM data SHP. It was mapped by calculating the Euclidean distance from the rivers using the file. After the transition potential matrix was created, the LULC forecast for the year 2020 was modeled. Finally, the LULC simulation of the year 2030 was obtained with the MLP-ANN model. Validation of the modle of MLP-ANN is important; therefore, validation between the Q GIS Molusce extension and the MLP-ANN model, the simulated LULC for 2020 and the 2020 LULC, was obtained and the kappa coefficient was obtained.
For the prediction model of 2030, machine learning MLP-ANN algorithm was used in the field of UA and GIS. This model works such as the brain of human, where each neuron node carries information processing between them. nodes which are processing units are interconnected by or ANN with artificial neurons. output a d Input units make up the units processing of the ANN. ANN has a set of learning rules and a result follows. In the training phase of ANN, supervised and unsupervised the methods of learning are performed. In the first phase of ANN, data models will be recognized textually and visually. The wroks of ANN backwards and adjusts the connections network of weight until it produces a minimum of erroneous output 
the model of structure of ANN defined three layers, these layers are the output, hidden and input layers. The ANN of flow working of for datasets of raster is shown in Figure 
In the prediction model of 2030, LU/LC maps (raster) were used as the basic input data of 2000, 2010 and 2020 (for verification) of the present data. The supplement (auxiliary data) used in the 2030 forecast is shown in the Table 
Dem is important for geoscientists as it gives quantitative information about the structure of the land 
Calculated based on DEM, this factor shows the slope according to the Literature. It is accepted as one of the factors that have the greatest impact on urbanization 
NDVI Index: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (Formula 1).
The NDVI index is the mot important data revealing the pressure of urbanization on green areas 
In order to better demonstrate the transformation from green areas in the land cover to built-up areas, the NDVI index was used as the predictive model auxiliary data.
Formula 1. NDVI Index on below Landsat 7 Landsat 8 B4-B3 B4+B3 | B5-B4 B5+B4: Water has been a very important natural resource in the establishment and spread of settlements throughout history. Cities have been established and developed depending on the availability of suitable natural conditions and water resources. In this respect, there is a close relationship between the water resources on earth and the distribution of urban centers. It has been seen that urban areas have been established near fresh water sources such as rivers, lakes and underground waters and on the sea coast for a long time. The horizontal development of cities established near water resources varies depending on the geomorphology and characteristics of the coast and the area behind it 
By selecting the first and second raster Dem data, a two-way raster comparison was made and all raster data loaded into MOLUSCE was checked. Pearson's correlation was used to compare the data in this study. The correlation coefficient between the data is given in Table 
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) machine learning algorithm (Figure 
The procedure c of validation compares the accuracy of the estimated LULC with the map of LULC obtained by processing Landsat raw data as a reference. The Kappa coefficient was used for validation purposes. It is calculated using the Kappa coefficient, see. Equation 2  | Results: The changes of LU/LC to better understand, the results are divided into 4 parts: (i.) an accuracy assessment and composition of the LU/LC layers for the years 2000, 2010 2020; (ii.) change the periods of 2000-2010 analysis; (iii.) 2020 simulation with MLP-ANN method, results of comparison of simulation with 2020 data of LU/LC, determination of the method that provides the accuracy highest in the research (iv.) land cover forecast for 2030 using the method that gave the best results in the 2020 simulation. The terrain classes maps made using the maximum likelihood algorithm are given in Figure 
Parameters of ccuracy such as manufacturer and accuracy user, overall accuracy classification and coefficient of kappa of classified the maps of LULC are given in Table 
The forecast model of the accuracy of was examined by comparing the 2020 LULC forecast map with the 2020 LULC map classified. The 2020 LULC map was estimated using the 2000 and 2010 LULC maps. The overall accuracy obtained was 72% and the kappa coefficient was 0.65. This shows that the classified and predicted LULC maps of 2020 are in valid agreement with each other. Figure 
After analyzing LU changes between the two periods, relevant co-factors were determined. The co-factors Slope and Distance from River maps obtained from the Dem data are shown in Figure 
Each LU/LC category; the first step of the LCM includes rates of change, where land use change trends are evaluated in terms of losses and gains incurred. LULC losses and gains are analyzed for the period 2000-2010, 2010-2020. Tables 
Between the years 2000-2010 in Samsun, coastal filling areas were realized especially in Ilkadƒ±m district and thus an urban growth was experienced in the northern direction. Batƒ±park, Doƒüupark city parks, etc., which were built in the filling area. coastal arrangements, parks and sports fields have been effective in bringing the district to the fore. Filling areas obtained by filling the shores are used as ports, piers, fishermen's shelters, marinas, parks, public institutions and organizations.
The need for housing and social reinforcement areas, which emerged in parallel with the rapid population growth (annual increase rate of 64.5%) in the 2000-2010 period in Atakum district, caused the areal increases in the urban texture to create a more heterogeneous city pattern 
Among the parks on both sides of Samsun, Batƒ±park is 1.000.000 m¬≤ and Doƒüupark is 250.000 m¬≤. With the completion of these projects, the green area per capita has reached 9.02 square meters.
Transition Probabilities and Future Projection is an image layer of transition potential represents the probability of transition from one LU/LC class to each another for pixel 
The variation of LULC classes between land classes over the 2000-2020 time periods is shown in Figure 
According to the results obtained, the decrease in the water mass in the study area, which includes Samsun Ilkadƒ±m -Atakum -Bafra city centers and the coastline in the 20-year period between 2000 and 2020, shows the transformation into built-up areas by making the shoreline filling area. The decrease in green areas shows the transformation into bare soil areas. With the transformation into bare areas, construction begins. The filling of Samsun coastal areas dates back to the 1960s and accelerates after the 2000s 
The north-eastern part of the region includes the city center. But over the years, it is seen that the settlement has spread in the direction the topography allows. It is seen that the settlement increases in the south-west direction along the coastline. This spread towards rural areas first became a bare area and then transformed into a residential area. The matrix represents that the need for accelerated construction was came primarily by the decline in scrub and soil bare, followed by farmland and sparse vegetation.
According to the results of the algorithm, the ongoing change direction between 2000-2020 is also expected for 2030. The variation of LULC classes between land classes over the time periods 2020-2030 (10 years) is shown in Figure  | Discussions: Due to the environmental problems caused by rapid and uncontrolled urbanization, studies to understand the land change and to predict possible changes in the future are increasing rapidly. datasets of remote sensing, available as open access, economical, up-to-date, and archival, are the most common systems used for spatial/temporal modeling and to determine LU/LC changes and urban growth. In this study, the LULC change between 2000, 2010, 2020 for the study area including Ilkadƒ±m, the central district where the development is most intense in Samsun, the largest port city of the Black Sea, Atakum along the coastline, and Bafra, the rural district with the most agricultural lands. were analyzed and a land change forecast for 2030 was made using the MLP-ANN (multi-layer perception artificial neural network) algorithm. The rate of land change for the years 2000, 2010, 2020, 2030 is shown in Table 
For the accuracy of the study, precautions were taken during the data download and processing stages. For example, we preferred satellite images of the summer months and recent dates so that the land cover can be seen more clearly due to seasonal factors. During the download phase of the satellite images, we determined the cloud-free rate, and at the same time, we separated the cloud-free images during the preview phase of the images. In the land classification stage, since the spectral signatures of bare soil and built areas are similar to each other, the two classes are mixed. We re-checked this separation with the Jeffries-Matusita distance meter and repeated the samples with close values. However, there are many different factors that will affect the accuracy in estimation studies. For example, heterogeneity of land in urban areas affects the results. Due to technical errors, situations that may affect the accuracy of the model may occur at the classification stage. In addition, factors of human activities are not taken into account in the estimation of LULC data 
Ozturk, (2015) chose Samsun Atakum district as the study area and compared the kappa accuracy coefficients of the results of the two estimation algorithms (CA-MC and MLP-MC) and stated that the most accurate method was MLP-MC Multi-Layer Perceptron-Markov Chain. can reach figures that will be considered valid and useful for all algorithms, but the preference of machine learning (ANN) in this study has added up-to-dateness to the study. As a result of the study and in the literature review, it is seen that the auxiliary data added to the estimation algorithm are important data that affect the land change, their numbers and accuracy affect the accuracy coefficient of the algorithm. For example,  | Conclusions: Remote sensing methods are one of the most efficient methods used to analyze spatial and temporal terrain change. Machine learning for prediction is one of the methods that has emerged in recent years. In the current study, it was deemed appropriate to use the artificial neural network (MLP-ANN) algorithm. Considering the results, the conversion of fertile lands to bare land and built lands will create future ecological problems and unproductive areas that cannot meet the natural food requirement.
Our study does not currently include estimates of the impact of land change on climate change, but as  | Suggestions: Based on the results, ongoing planning criteria need to be reconsidered to prevent loss of farmland and other vegetation. It is strongly recommended that the population spread should be shaped according to the new plans. In the planning phase, multidisciplinary teams consisting of city planners, landscape architects, surveyors and architects should be formed and joint work should be done. Urbanization plans cannot be considered by ignoring the ecological characteristics and habitat of the area.","Spatio-temporal simulation and prediction of land-use change using conventional and machine learning models: a review (, , , 2019) || Spatial and decadal prediction of land use/land cover using multi-layer perceptron-neural network (MLP-NN) algorithm for a semi-arid region of Asir, Saudi Arabia (, , , , , , 2021) || Future land use land cover prediction with special emphasis on urbanization and wetlands (, , 2020) || Provincial and District Areas (, ) || Samsun Integrated Coastal Areas Management and Planning Project-Spatial Strategy Plan (, ) || Statistical indicators (, ) || Land Use and Temporal Change in the Kƒ±zƒ±lƒ±rmak Delta (Samsun) (1987-2019) (, , 2019) || 2015-2019 STRATEGIC PLAN (, 2014) || Neural network approaches versus statistical methods in classification of multisource remote sensing data (, , , , 1990.

We present a cross-comparison and accuracy assessment of Google's Dynamic World (DW), ESA's World Cover (WC) and Esri's Land Cover (Esri) products for the first time in order to inform the adoption and application of these maps going forward. For the year 2020, the three global LULC maps show strong spatial correspondence (i.e., near-equal area estimates) for water, built area, trees and crop LULC classes. However, relative to one another, WC is biased towards over-estimating grass cover, Esri towards shrub and scrub cover and DW towards snow and ice. Using global ground truth data with a minimum mapping unit of 250 m 2 , we found that Esri had the highest overall accuracy (75%) compared to DW (72%) and WC (65%). Across all global maps, water was the most accurately mapped class (92%), followed by built area (83%), tree cover (81%) and crops (78%), particularly in biomes characterized by temperate and boreal forests. The classes with the lowest accuracies, particularly in the tundra biome, included shrub and scrub (47%), grass (34%), bare ground (57%) and flooded vegetation (53%). When using European ground truth data from LUCAS (Land Use/Cover Area Frame Survey) with a minimum mapping unit of <100 m 2 , we found that WC had the highest accuracy (71%) compared to DW (66%) and Esri (63%), highlighting the ability of WC to resolve landscape elements with more detail compared to DW and Esri. Although not analyzed in our study, we discuss the relative advantages of DW due to its frequent and near real-time data delivery of both categorical predictions and class probability scores. We recommend that the use of global LULC products should involve critical evaluation of their suitability with respect to the application purpose, such as aggregate changes in ecosystem accounting versus site-specific change detection in monitoring, considering trade-offs between thematic resolution, global versus. local accuracy, class-specific biases and whether change analysis is necessary. We also emphasize the importance of not estimating areas from pixel-counting alone but adopting best practices in design-based inference and area estimation that quantify uncertainty for a given study area.","Introduction: Global land use land cover (LULC) maps provide information necessary to quantify and understand Earth system processes and anthropogenic pressures, often at multiple spatial and temporal scales 
Global LULC maps are adopted in a vast range of scientific domains and application environments. A few examples of LULC map application include: data input into mesoscale models for operational numerical weather forecasts and climate models for future climate projections 
Over the past two decades, the spatial resolution of land cover maps has kept pace with the resolution of available satellite sensors, including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS; 250-500 m), PROBA-v (100 m) and Landsat (30 m) satellites. The most prominent corresponding global LULC maps include the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) MCD12Q1 500 m resolution dataset 
Advancing upon the revolutionary legacy of the open-access Landsat missions 
To date, there have been no systematic evaluations of the three global 10 m LULC products with reference to one another. Given the importance of global LULC maps for various applications, and the large differences in the production of the recent 10 m products, we aimed to compare DW, WC and Esri global LULC maps in terms of their spatial correspondence with one another and their global and regional accuracy. To quantify accuracy at the global scale, we used the hand-annotated validation dataset published alongside DW. We supplemented this with a regional reference dataset of in situ point-based survey data on LULC across the European Union. We discuss how spatial correspondence and accuracy vary across LULC classes, biomes and human settlement types and explore key limitations and advantages of the three datasets. | Materials and Methods:  | Land Cover Data Processing: Data pre-processing and extraction took place in GEE  | Spatial Correspondence Assessment: To assess how strongly the global LULC products corresponded to one another over space, we quantified and compared class-wise LULC area sums that were aggregated to an equal-area hexagonal grid (70,000 km 2 ), which covered the globe. The size of the grid was chosen based on a trade-off between computation time and precision of area  | Spatial Correspondence Assessment: To assess how strongly the global LULC products corresponded to one another over space, we quantified and compared class-wise LULC area sums that were aggregated to an equal-area hexagonal grid (70,000 km 2 ), which covered the globe. The size of the grid was chosen based on a trade-off between computation time and precision of area aggregation. Pixels were aggregated over mutually overlapping extents and image masks across the three LULC products. To quantify correspondence between products, for each LULC class and unique hexagonal grid cell, we calculate the proportional share of each product's area estimation. Perfect correspondence resulted in a proportional ratio of 0.33:0.33:0.33 or 33% proportional share for each product. We defined strong correspondence when no single product's proportional share of the LULC class area exceeded 40% in a grid cell. Therefore, weak correspondence was when the maximum difference between the product with the biggest and smallest proportional share was greater than 20%. We visualized these proportional shares for each hexagon over the globe by assigning a color code along a tri-color gradient using the tricolore (v1.2.2.) package in R. The relative abundance of the given LULC class (average of the three products' area estimates) was mapped to the opacity of each hexagon grid so that areas where the LULC is abundant appear opaque and those where the LULC is less abundant are transparent. | Accuracy Assessment: To quantify the accuracy of the three LULC products, we used two sources of openaccess reference data (Figure  | Flooded vegetation: Wetlands (H00): Wetlands located inland and having fresh water and wetlands located on marine coasts or having salty or brackish water as well as areas of a marine origin.  | LULC Class LUCAS Classes Used and Descriptions:  | Water: Water areas (G10 to G40): Inland or coastal areas without vegetation and covered by water and flooded surfaces, or likely to be so over a large part of the year. | Snow and ice: Glaciers, permanent snow (G50): Areas covered by glaciers (generally measured at the time of their greatest expansion in the season) or permanent snow.
The 2020 LULC predictions for each global product were sampled over the annotated image pixels (global validation set) and survey locations (regional validation set). Accuracy was quantified globally/regionally, but also stratified by biome, settlement type (urban, rural and uninhabited) and continent. Biomes were defined using the RESOLVE bioregions dataset  | Implementation Details: Data were summarized and/or extracted from GEE using the JavaScript API. The data were summarized by a global grid created using the dgggridR (v2.0.3) package. The figures were all created in R (v4.2.1) using the tricolore (v1.2.2.), ggplot2 (v3.3.5), ggmap (v3.0.0), sf (v1.0.9) and raster (v3.5) packages. | Results:  | Spatial Correspondence: The area estimates for built area, crops, trees and water showed strong correspondence between the three global LULC products, particularly in areas with the greatest relative abundance of the given LULC class (i.e., gray areas with bordered grid cells in Figure 
The LULC classes with the lowest correspondence between global products were bare ground, grass, scrub and shrub (Figure 
The LULC classes flooded vegetation, and snow and ice exhibited notable disagreements between products for the northern latitudes (Figure  | Accuracy: Using the global ground truth dataset with a minimum mapping unit of 250 m 2 , we found that Esri had the highest overall accuracy (75%) compared to DW (72%) and WC (65%; Table  | Accuracy Dynamic World Esri World Cover: Global validation 72% 75% 65% Regional validation (European) 66% 63% 71% Using the regional ground truth dataset (LUCAS) across Europe with an MMU of <100 m 2 , we found that the order of product accuracies was reversed compared to the global validation (Table  | Discussion:  | Explaining the Differences between Global LULC Products: The production of global LULC maps is inherently difficult due to the extensive biogeographical variations within and across biomes that lead to diverse spectral signatures within a single LULC class  | Discussion:  | Explaining the Differences between Global LULC Products: The production of global LULC maps is inherently difficult due to the extensive biogeographical variations within and across biomes that lead to diverse spectral signatures within a single LULC class  | Minimum Mapping Unit: The global LULC maps had contrasting accuracies when validated against the global versus regional reference datasets (Figure  | Classification Typology: Another factor leading to differences between global LULC products is the classification typology used. For the purposes of cross-comparison, we harmonized all three LULC products to a nine-class typology (Table 
Another source of discrepancy between LULC products is the slight difference in LULC definitions for certain classes (see descriptions in Table  | Modeling and Validation Methods: At the global scale, the accuracies of DW, WC and Esri were different to one another (Figure 
The DW and Esri maps were produced using a deep learning model, whereas WC was produced using a random forest classification. This difference in modeling framework likely explains some of the difference in accuracy between LULC products. Deep learning models, such as the fully convolutional neural network employed in DW, take the pixel context into account when making inferences, whereas random forest does not. This, together with the difference in MMU, explains why the DW and Esri maps are clustered and generalized at a landscape scale (inset maps Figure 
Finally, we acknowledge that we are using reference data from 2019 (global) and 2018 (European) that do not align with the year of the LULC maps (2020) and that this may lead to discrepancies between the validation set and the reality on the ground in 2020. However, we suspect these changes to be minimal, and any bias introduced should be consistent across global LULC products. Furthermore, even the WC reference dataset, which is not open-access, faces the same limitation as it was collected for the year 2015 and used to create and validate the WC map for the year 2020. | Recommendations for Users: The cross-comparison results presented here indicate that there is no ""one-size-fits-all"" when it comes to global LULC maps and their potential application. We find differences in accuracy across spatial scales (global versus regional), LULC classes, continents, biomes and urban settlement types. Therefore, an overall recommendation is to carefully evaluate the global LULC products with respect to the aforementioned factors and how they relate to the application requirements. We note that it is also possible to use all three LULC products in combination by creating some form of majority vote or weighted average. Nevertheless, we make some general recommendations for users of either DW, Esri or WC or a combination thereof: | ‚Ä¢: Regardless of LULC product, users should implement design-based inference when calculating LULC areas or changes and avoid drawing conclusions from simple 'pixelcounting', which leads to biased area estimates  | ‚Ä¢: WC is most appropriate when considering an MMU of <100 m 2 or when a user wants to resolve smaller landscape elements. For example, WC is advantageous in urban areas and complex agricultural landscapes with small or thin vegetation structures, such as trees or hedge rows. | ‚Ä¢: Based on our supplementary analysis of the DW compositing method (Figure  | ‚Ä¢: The delivery format of DW in near real-time, covering the entire Sentinel-2 image collection and including LULC class-specific probability scores, is qualitatively unique from Esri and WC, which only produce annual LULC maps without probability scores. We encourage users to take advantage of this unique aspect to DW by exploring novel possibilities discussed in the section below. | Potential for Future Research: Although our analysis provides important information about global model accuracies, it remains to be seen which LULC product provides area change estimates with the least amount of error as measured using design-based inference for area estimation 
The probability scores available in the DW product provide scope for several other avenues of further research and tailored LULC classification. Firstly, they can be aggregated over time frames relevant to the application task. For example, annual composites might be appropriate for some tasks, while summer or winter mosaics might be appropriate for others. Secondly, users can apply custom thresholds or more complex decision frameworks to the predicted probabilities in order to derive continuous or discrete LULC outputs (Figure 
There are several spheres of application for which 10 m LULC maps are particularly well-suited. Urban ecology and climate science is one such area because landscape composition and structure often manifest at scales of 10 m or less. In an increasingly urbanizing planet, it is important to accurately monitor global and regional urban extent for planning purposes. How these newer-generation datasets compare to existing estimates across regions is still largely unknown  | Conclusions: LULC mapping at global extents has been revolutionized by the plethora of mediumresolution satellite data available from programs such as Landsat and Sentinel. In our cross-comparison of global 10 m resolution LULC maps, we found large inaccuracies and spatial and thematic biases in each product that vary across biomes, continents and human settlement types. Our overarching recommendation is to critically evaluate each LULC product with reference to the application purpose. We highlight the novelty of DW as a global near real-time LULC product with class probability scores. LULC types, regardless of definition and type system, share with ecosystems the property that their composition, structure and processes often vary in a gradual, continuous manner over space and time. We suggest that the DW probability scores offer a fundamental shift in land cover mapping from categorical to continuum concepts.","Recent Applications of Landsat 8/OLI and Sentinel-2/MSI for Land Use and Land Cover Mapping: A Systematic Review (, , , ) || Sentinel-2 Data for Land Cover/Use Mapping: A Review (, , , , , , ) || Finer-Resolution Mapping of Global Land Cover: Recent Developments, Consistency Analysis, and Prospects (, , , , , , ) || Towards Delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals Using Earth Observations (, , , , , , , , , ) || Representing a New MODIS Consistent Land Surface in the Community Land Model (CLM 3.0) (, , 2007. 01023) || Assessment of Implementing Satellite-Derived Land Cover Data in the Eta Model.

Land use land cover change and the resilience of social-ecological systems in a sub-region in South west Cameroon,Ewane Ewane,"LULCC and magnitude of impact of the drivers and predictors of LULCC in the sub-region by engag-| ing 25 stakeholders in a focus group survey. Other cultivated areas of cropland, built-up, oil palm, and banana plantation covers increased by 21,360 ha (10.5%), 3152 ha (1.6%), 5721 ha (2.8%), and 1823 ha (0.9%), while dense forest, rubber and tea plantation covers decreased by -44,945 ha (-22.1%), -15,557 ha (-7.7%), and -110 ha (-0.1%), respectively, from 1986 to 2018. Most of the deforestation and LULCC was caused by expansion of other cultivated areas of cropland by smallholders, contrary to the widely publicised narrative of agro-industrial and built-up areas expansion. The spatial pattern of LULCC showed that expansion of other cultivated areas of cropland and agro-industrial plantations were highest in the north and east zones, respectively, while expansion of builtup areas and decrease in agro-industrial plantation covers were highest in the central, south and western coastal zones of Fako division. The variations in the spatial patterns of LULCC between the sub-divisions are attributed to differences in rates of population growth and urbanisation, topography, size of farming population, proportion of cultivable land, socioeconomic opportunities, and strength and resilience of Abstract The old paradigm of horizontal expansion of agricultural land and built-up areas over highland and lowland ecosystems remains highly prevalent in Cameroon, causing significant changes in LULC and undermining the resilience and sustainability of social-ecological systems.

In addition, we explored the likelihood of Highlights ‚Ä¢ Most of the deforestation and LULCC was caused by expansion of other cultivated areas of cropland by smallholders, contrary to the widely publicised narrative of agro-industrial plantation and built-up area expansion from 1986 to 2018. ‚Ä¢ Dense forest and rubber plantation covers decreased, while oil palm and banana plantation covers increased, owing to local economics and increase in local and international palm oil demand. ‚Ä¢ Spatial patterns of change in LULC classes were highly variable within the sub-region, but common temporal trends in LULCC were observed on the most part. ‚Ä¢ Differences in biophysical and socio-economic factors explained the variability in the spatial patterns of LULCC among sub-divisions. ‚Ä¢ Changes in LULC decreased with elevation, but increased with nearness to the sea and national road networks.","Introduction: Holistically, landscape as a geographical area is characterised by its biophysical contents of observable, natural, and human-induced characteristics, including ecosystem type and socio-cultural relations to areas at different spatial scales 
Decision-making in land use land cover change (LULCC) can be explained, to a large extent, by the socio-economic, climatic, and soil conditions of a location 
SES are integrated complex and adaptive systems, in which social and ecological sub-systems are coupled and interdependent, each a function of the other, expressed in a series of mutual feedback relationships 
Landscapes and their ecosystems are influenced by the institutions that govern their use and by the indigenous communities dependent on the forest resources 
The spatio-temporal patterns, processes, and causes of LULCC are still not well understood in land system science 
The old paradigm of horizontal expansion of agricultural land and built-up areas over highland and lowland ecosystems remains the norm in Cameroon, causing significant changes in LULC and undermining the resilience and sustainability of SES along its western highland region, where the study area of Fako division is located. The biophysical landscape of the study area is composed of important lowland agricultural estates, mountain forests, and coastal mangrove ecological systems across its five sub-divisions, which are undergoing increasing transformation. In this study, the concept of SES was used to understand human-environment interactions and outcome, while that of LULCC was used to understand the spatio-temporal patterns and processes of change related to biophysical and socio-economic factors in Fako division from 1986 to 2018. 
The main objective of this study is to explore LULCC and expert stakeholder perceptions of changing SES in Fako division, South west region of Cameroon. Specifically, the study aims  | Methods:  | Study area: The study area is Fako division (Fig. 
The sub-region falls within the tropical rainforest zone with an equatorial monsoon climate. Annual rainfall ranges from 2000 to 4000 mm, attributed to the effect of the forested Mount Cameroon (4095 m above sea level), which intercepts wet air masses and its proximity to the Atlantic Coast of Cameroon. The highest rainfall comes between July and September with monthly amounts ranging from 400 to 500 mm, particularly in Limbe, Buea, and West Coast sub-divisions, with the latter receiving even higher monthly and annual rainfall. The high annual rainfall and historical volcanic eruption of lava and ash contributes to the very high soil fertility in the sub-region, which is highly exploited for small-, medium-, and large-scale agricultural production activities. The sub-region presents the best example of historically human-induced progressive conversion and changes in lowland dense forest and grassland cover in Cameroon, predominantly for plantation agriculture, a legacy of German colonial administration. Current urban sprawl dominated by housing development and expanding arable cropland and agro-industrial plantations in peri-urban areas are significantly transforming the landscape and producing varied social-ecological systems in Fako Division. | Data sources:  | Land use land cover data: A combination of Multispectral Scanner 3 (MSS), Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus 7 (ETM +), and Landsat Operational Land Imager 8 (OLI) was used to obtain the LULC and LULCC data of Fako division, in the South west region of Cameroon (http:// glovis. usgs. gov/), supplemented with Google Earth Imagery data. Details of the methods of LULCC data collection and the general procedure for acquisition of the LULC maps and classification of LULC classes can be found in 
The study is based on the biophysical landscape characterisation approach using statistical analyses to obtain LULC data in order to identify gradients of variation in the presence and /or abundance of landscape diversity 
The study used two LULC maps of Fako division for the period 1986 (Fig.  | Focus group survey data: This exploratory study followed a stakeholder-driven scenario development during multi-stakeholder questionnaire administration in focus group discussion sessions held in Buea, headquarter of Fako division. Focus group survey is a form of group interview that capitalises on communication and deliberation between participants to generate data based on a group consensus 
Stakeholders play an important role in scenario analysis, especially for assessing and modelling future LULCC and their possible impacts 
The identification and selection of participants for the stakeholder focus group interview took into consideration the participant's knowledge of evolving land uses, their drivers, and indicators, and demonstrated interest, willingness, and readiness in local knowledge sharing and collaborative learning. The survey method involved the selection of economic sectors and development of qualitative and semiquantitative sector trajectories; assessing the likelihood of LULCC, identifying the drivers, indicators, and the spatial patterns. In the stakeholder scenario analysis, we used the business as usual scenario (BUS) and green economy scenario (GES). In the BUS, continuous expansion of human degradation activities such as land use conversion to agricultural uses impacts forests, woodland, and wetlands, with no productivity gain expected. In the GES, decreasing deforestation and degradation with increasing productivity and implementation of payment for ecosystem service schemes is envisaged 
In this study, we identified 8 socio-economic drivers of LULCC specific to Cameroon, including population growth, agricultural and cropland expansion, biomass energy (fuelwood and charcoal) exploitation, livestock grazing, commercial logging/timber exploitation (legal and illegal), bushfires (human-set fire), infrastructural development, and mining expansion. All the 25 participants in the focus groups were presented with these socio-economic sectors most relevant to local livelihoods and national economy. It is invaluable to define a representation of the proximate and most important groups of drivers and underlying causes of deforestation and LULCC 
During the focus groups, participants were encouraged to use information such as specific sites of potential LULCC such as administrative units or gazetted sites, or biophysical factors associated with them such as nearness to mountain, sea and national road network, proportion of cultivable land, endemism, conservation attraction, size of farm labour, and business growth attractions, among others, in the ranking exercises. The stakeholders discussed their different perspectives to generate consensus and harmonise visions within each sub-division and in the sub-region. Each expert focus group discussion session was led by a facilitator, who took notes and ensure a collective understanding of the objectives, without actively participating in the discussion. The structured questions were designed to explore expert stakeholder observations, perceptions, and future scenarios of either continuous resource degradation or improved resource governance, sustainable land use planning and green economy development based on the current activities and practices in the sub-region. | Data analysis: Quantitative analyses for LULCC assessment statistics and understanding of evolving spatial patterns and trajectories in the sub-region from 1986 to 2018 were performed using ArcGIS 10.2. Data on the likelihood for potential changes from one LULC class to another in each of the sub-divisions was analysed using a likelihood probability ratio scale to locate the points of similarity or dissimilarity of variables within the sub-divisions and sub-region. We used the likelihood probability ratio scale of 0.95-1.0 (Extremely likely), 0.9-1.0 (Very likely), 0.66-1.0 (Likely), 0.50-1.0 (Possible), 0.33-1.0 (Unlikely), 0.10-1.0 (Very unlikely), and 0.05-1.0 (Extremely unlikely). This vulnerability or likelihood scale enabled stakeholders to deliberate and negotiate uncertainty and confidence intervals of variables in the LULCC and scenario analysis framework. Data from stakeholder ranking of the drivers and indicators of LULCC under the BUS and GES were also analysed using radar charts while statistically significant differences in the stakeholder perceptions ranking across the five sub-divisions was detected using Friedman test statistics in XLSTAT version 2020. In a radar chart, the data length of a spoke is proportional to the magnitude of the variable for the data point starting from a center point of 0.0 relative to the maximum magnitude point of 1.0 of the variable across all the data points  | Results:  | Spatial distribution of land use land cover change assessment: The spatial distribution of LULCC among the five sub-divisions in the sub-region showed appreciable spatial and temporal variability but with somehow similar trends from 1986 to 2018 (Appendix 1). In Buea sub-division, dense forest cover decreased from 25,937 to 12,736 ha (-50.9%), that is, by 22.3% of the total land surface area, and at an annual rate of 0.7% (Table 
In Limbe sub-division, dense forest cover decreased from 12,675 to 9818 ha (-22.5%), that is, by 11.76% of the total land surface area, and at an average annual rate of 0.37% from 1986 to 2018 (Table 
In Tiko sub-division, dense forest cover decreased from 16,221 to 5179 ha (-68.1%), that is, by 23.8% of the total land surface area, and at an average annual rate of 0.67% from 1986 to 2018 (Table 
In Muyuka sub-division, dense forest cover decreased from 29,618 to 6859 ha (-76.8%), that is, by 47.4% of the total land surface area, and at an average annual rate of 1.48% from 1986 to 2018 (Table 
In West Coast sub-division, dense forest decreased from 17,565 to 6232 ha (-64.5%), that is, by 46.1% of the total land surface area, at an average annual rate of 1.44% from 1986 to 2018 (Table 
For LULCC at the sub-regional scale, mangrove forest, grassland, and montane forest increased from 14,971 to 20,155 ha (2.55%), 9062 to 9686 ha (0.31%), and 2795 to 28,733 ha (12.8%), respectively, from 1986 to 2018 (Table 
Under the GES analysis, sustainable land management (e.g. adequate master and land use plans), good governance (e.g. law enforcement, capacity building, community awareness), conservation (e.g. creation of protected areas, community forest, council forest), and afforestation and reforestation (ecosystem restoration initiatives) were ranked as the most important measures towards LULCC reduction in all the subdivisions. On the other hand, sustainable forest management (good practices, access, and equity in benefit sharing), incentives (payment for ecosystem services to smallholders and communities), and technological improvement (improved stoves, alternative energy sources) were ranked as the lowest impact measures towards LULCC reduction under GES in the subdivisions (Fig. 
Furthermore, the expert stakeholders ranked the indicators of the socio-economic drivers of LULCC under the BUS and GES and the results were similar on the most part, with only small variations in the order of the ranking of the indicators among the subdivisions (Figs. 
The likelihood of a potential change from one LULC to another was envisaged to be highest for mangrove forest, oil palm plantation, banana planation, water, dense forest, and other cultivated areas in Buea subdivision (Fig. 
The spatial pattern of degradation of LULC under the BUS in the future is presented in Fig. 
The spatial pattern of degradation of LULC under the GES in the future is presented in Fig.  | Discussion: In the 1980s, landscape transformation in the study area was mainly dominated by conversion of lowland dense forest and grassland to agro-industrial plantations in a time of low population growth and low land and food demand, thus producing more resilient and adaptable SES. In the 2000s, the historical hot zones for agro-industrial plantations that were initial sites of rapid dense forest cover conversion became attractive sites for conversion to built-up areas and other cultivated areas of cropland in the sub-region, following increased population growth and high land and food demand, thus producing less resilient and adaptable SES. The spatial pattern of LULCC show some appreciable common decreasing trends in dense forest cover in all the five sub-divisions, with the decrease ranging from 11.76 to 47.4% from 1986 to 2018. The increased LULCC from the year 2000 are associated with the dwindling resilience and adaptability of SES in areas closer to the sea and national road networks in the sub-region, where social systems such as student villages, residential suburbs, migrant settlements, and farming and fishing village communities have developed and expanded at the detriment of ecological systems such as lowland forests, grassland and mangroves. Consistent with this result, forest cover loss showed increasing trends in four community forests in Fako division from 2001 to 2018, due to mainly to agricultural expansion, illegal exploitation of wood and non-wood products, and weak governance 
The decrease in rubber plantation cover, ranging from 1.08 to 13.2% across all the sub-divisions, is indicative of changing global commodity consumption patterns and falling commodity product prices in the export market, consistent with the observations of 
The population of Fako division has almost doubled over the last 30 years, that is, from 248,032 inhabitants in 1987 to 466,412 inhabitants in 2005 with a growth rate of 4.89, compared to a national average of 2.59%. Urban sprawl remains the dominant and widely prevailing form of urban growth in the sub-region. The observed significant differences in the increase of built-up areas between the sub-divisions are attributable to differences in population growth, socio-economic attractions, and strength and resilience of the local economy. Buea and Limbe sub-divisions have higher population growth rates (> 4.5% compared to 2.59% national average), urbanisation rate, socio-economic attractions, business growth rate, and traffic density than Tiko, Muyuka, and West Coast sub-divisions with significantly more agrarian local economy. Beyond 2000, much of the expansion in built-up areas and other cultivated areas of cropland occurred more in non-forest than forest areas in Buea and Limbe subdivisions, leading to a decrease in the area cover of agro-industrial plantations. Built-up land expansion due to urban growth usually occurs at the expense of ecological land cover classes in many developing countries 
In addition, the rapid population growth is causing high land value and increasing competition for farmland, leading to increased food prices, and threatening food security in Buea and Limbe sub-divisions. In particular, the rapid population growth rate due mainly to migration is triggering unprecedented progressive land tenure change from public land tenure to customary tenure and private land ownership since the 2000s to meet up with the increasing land demand for housing and farmland development. The wellintended government development strategy of land redistribution (land reform) has increased land and land use conflict, systematic land grabbing by local elites, wealthy business owners and decentralised government administrators, and exacerbated forest clearing and land use conversion for personal gains, consistent with the results of 
The old paradigm of horizontal expansion of smallholder cultivated areas of cropland and agro-industrial (including non-industrial oil palm) plantations remains the main form of agricultural growth in the sub-region. It occurs in both non-forest and dense forest areas, mostly in West Coast, Muyuka, and Tiko sub-divisions of the sub-region, with higher farming population and poorer socio-economic development. Smallholder land use decision-making in terms of survivalist, subsistence-oriented, and market-oriented types are more likely found in areas with higher poverty levels and overall lower levels of socio-economic development 
Results on the spatial distribution of LULCC in the sub-region indicated dense forest cover and other cultivated areas of cropland, respectively, decreased and increased the highest in the Northern and Eastern zones, located in Muyuka (-47.4% and 16.2%) and Tiko (-23.8% and 11.9%) sub-divisions from 1986 to 2018. In both sub-divisions, the topography is relatively low-lying, high farming population, and large proportion of cultivable land favoured the conversion of dense forest to cocoa, arable cropland, and agro-industrial plantations. In the northern zone, the on-going armed conflict in Anglophone Cameroon is causing more and more people to seek semi-permanent refuge in the forests, clearing more forest land to expand farmland and semi-permanent settlements. In general, the lowland ecological systems in the subregion experienced tremendous transformation due to greater vulnerability to overwhelming human pressure, undermining their resilience and sustainability. The lowland dense forest and grassland covers were converted to other land uses, mainly other cultivated areas (10.51%), oil palm (2.82%), banana (0.92%) plantations, and built-up areas (1.6%). In the lowland ecological systems, LULCC mostly increased with nearness to the Atlantic Coastline and settlements, and along national road networks and major markets linking main cities, towns, and villages in the sub-region, emphasising the vulnerability of lowland and coastalland boundary ecosystems. Consistent with this study results, 
On the other hand, the conversion of dense forest to other land uses was lower (-13,201 ha and -22.3%) in the mountain ecological systems in Buea sub-division, indicating their greater resilience to human-induced change relating to deforestation and forest degradation, and lesser vulnerability to agricultural expansion activities compared to lowland areas of Muyuka and Tiko sub-divisions. The results confirm the hypothesis that LULCC decreased with increase in elevation of Mount Cameroon (4095 m), a biophysical barrier in the northwest zone, emphasising the resilience of the mountain ecosystem in the sub-region. 
The stakeholder groups successfully ranked the drivers and indicators of LULCC under the BUS and GES despite the technical complexity of the questionnaire, thanks to the higher education level, academic and professional background, and technical experience. Under the BUS, the expert stakeholders emphasised that population growth, agricultural land expansion, infrastructural development, and biomass energy exploitation (fuelwood and charcoal), respectively, are the key drivers of increased LULCC in the sub-region. This is consistent with the findings of  | 338: Page 20 of 23
The expansion of agricultural and croplands is consistent with government policy encouraging more youths to engage in agriculture as a means of employment, with the aim of increasing national GDP from export earnings, food security, nutrition diversity, household income, and local economic resilience. This is consistent with reports that arable production in Cameroon is declining or stagnating, and the situation is pushing more people to facing the problems of food insecurity 
The expert stakeholders ranked sustainable land management, good governance, conservation, and reforestation, respectively, as the highest impact drivers and predictors of green economy development, with only small variations in stakeholder perceptions between the sub-divisions. Consistent with this result, 
The stakeholders emphasised that population growth and sustainable land management, respectively, are the main drivers of increased and decreased degradation under the BUS and GES in the subregion. Population growth drives expansion in oil palm plantations at small scale, while national agricultural development plan triggers expansion of agroindustrial plantations at large spatial scales in the subregion  | Conclusion: Natural vegetation landscapes are undergoing significant human transformations, causing significant alterations of ecosystem services and functions, and undermining the resilience and sustainability of SES. We analysed satellite imagery of 1986 and 2018 to examine the extent and spatial patterns of LULCC and validated current and future LULCC scenarios with expert multi-stakeholder perceptions in five subdivisions of Fako division of Cameroon. The increase in other cultivated areas of cropland, oil palm plantations and built-up areas, and decrease in dense forest and rubber plantation covers dominated the LULCC in the sub-region from 1986 to 2018. However, most of the deforestation and LULCC was caused by expansion of other cultivated areas of cropland by smallholders, contrary to the widely publicised narrative of agro-industrial and built-up areas expansion. Expansion of other cultivated areas of cropland, oil palm, and banana plantations were highest in the northern and eastern zones located in Muyuka and Tiko sub-divisions, respectively. The low-lying topography, higher proportion of cultivable land, farm labour, and predominantly agrarian local economy favoured horizontal agricultural land expansion more in the northern and eastern zones of the subregion. The increase in built-up areas was highest in Page 21 of 23 338 the central, south, and western coastal zones due to rapid population growth, unregulated urbanisation, and better socio-economic opportunities in Buea and Limbe sub-divisions. Due to the rapid unregulated urbanisation, urban sprawl was the dominant mode of urban growth in the sub-region. Rubber plantations and lowland dense forest are extremely vulnerable to degradation based on the economics of changing commodity market prices. Oil palm and banana plantations, mangrove, and montane forests showed appreciable resilience to human transformation activities in the sub-region. Population growth, agricultural and farmland expansion, and infrastructural development were ranked as the three most important drivers of degradation under the BUS, while sustainable land management, good governance, and afforestation/reforestation were ranked as the three most important predictors of LULCC reduction under the GES. LULCC decreased with increase in elevation of Mount Cameroon (4095 m) in the northwest zone, but increased with nearness to the Atlantic Coast in the western zone and national road networks, emphasising the resilience of the mountain ecosystem and the vulnerability of lowland and coastal-land boundary ecosystems. The west and south facing slopes of Mount Cameroon harbours high value forests with high endemism and conservation attractiveness, and remains a key biodiversity hot spot, watershed providing clean water, healthy soil and regulating the climate in the central Africa sub-region and beyond. In general, production and living land covers significantly increased at the expense of ecological land covers. Therefore, increasing the legal protection of the mountain and coastal land-boundary ecological systems while providing for production and living land is invaluable for the sustainability of ecosystem functions and services in the western highland region of Cameroon and in the rainforest-rich Congo Basin.","Urbanization, land use transformation and spatioenvironmental impacts: Analyses of trends and implications in major metropolitan regions of Ghana (, , , , , , , , 2020) || Shifting patterns of oil palm driven deforestation in Indonesia and implications for zero-deforestation commitments (, , , , , , 2017) || The impact of urbanization on agricultural dynamics: A case study in Belgium (, , , , 2020. 17692) || Environmental governance for the Anthropocene?

Development of a map for land use and land cover classification of the Northern Border Region using remote sensing and GIS,Abdulbasit Darem; Asma Alhashmi; Aloyoun Almadani; Ali Alanazi; Geraldine Sutantra,"The land use and land cover study (LULC) play an essential role in regional socio-economic development and natural resource management to develop sustainable development in vegetation changes, water quantity and quality, land resources, and coastal management. This study uses remote sensing data to investigate LULC in the Northern Border Region (NBR) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The purpose of this study is to obtain a better understanding of the patterns and drivers of changes in LULC in the NBR over the past three decades. Remote sensing data from Landsat imagery between 1990 and 2022 were used to classify LULC types, and a time series analysis was performed using Landsat imagery to detect changes over time. The classification finds four main classes: bare land, built-up area, rocks, and vegetation. The results indicate a significant increase in urban development. The outcomes revealed that most urbanization occurred in the outskirts of the cities, where previously there were bare soil lands. The main drivers of urbanization were population growth and economic development. These findings have important implications for city planning, the management of green spaces, and the sustainable development of cities. Maximum Likelihood classifier was used to perform the classification. The accuracy assessment demonstrated satisfactory results, with an overall accuracy of 92.6%. The study paves the way for further monitoring LULC changes in the NBR geographic location. The technique used was adequate to address the objectives of this study.","Introduction: LULC is a source of information for countries to make appropriate decisions based on remote sensing (RS) data. This knowledge and detection of land change are considered essential factors for planning land conservation, management, and development. Understanding the dynamics of environmental change to ensure sustainable development and formulate policies for the optimal future use of these lands. LULC classification is an important technique to assess the relationship between the environment and human activities 
This research study is significant because the growing population and the increasing socio-economic had created pressure on LULC, which led to unplanned and uncontrolled changes. The Northern Border Region is a critical ecological and economic zone that encompasses a variety of land uses and covers, including urban areas, agricultural lands that has not been used, and natural ecosystems. However, the region is undergoing rapid and extensive land-use changes, resulting in significant impacts on local communities, natural resources, and the environment. Therefore, it is essential to develop accurate and efficient tools to monitor and manage land use and land cover changes in the region. Remote sensing and GIS technologies offer a powerful means to quantify and analyze LULC changes, but their application requires a specific method tailored to the unique characteristics of the study site. Our study aimed to develop a map for land use and land cover classification of the Northern Border Region using remote sensing and GIS, which can provide a reliable and efficient tool to monitor and manage land use and land cover changes in the region. The study's results can contribute to the development of effective land management policies and practices, promote sustainable land use and resource conservation, and provide critical information for urban planning, agricultural management, and biodiversity conservation. The KSA plays a crucial role in global efforts to preserve the future of the Earth, as it launched the Green Saudi Initiative to renew its belief in a sustainable future for all. From this point of view, there was a need to study the environment and topography of the Kingdom from several points of view to delineate the maps of LULC. Information and data are needed to help decision-makers detect the change in the LULC of the NBR and understand the dynamics of environmental change to ensure sustainable development and formulate policies for the optimal future use of these lands. There are no previous studies covering the LULC of the Northern Border region. The generated and processed maps that will result from this study will be significant for the future planning of the NBR. In this study, RS techniques will be used to map the land use and cover of NBR, one of the most critical regions of the Kingdom in terms of environmental diversity, in addition to the presence of many essential minerals. Decision-makers can use the results of this study to manage natural resources in the region, help in socio-economic development, plan the appropriate use of land (agriculture, construction, and urban expansion), and know the size and type of vegetation in the northern border area. The maps from this study will help find suitable places for mining essential minerals in the northern border region.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides background information on the topic, followed by a review of relevant literature in Section 3. Section 4 describes the research design, including the deadest materials and procedures. Section 5 presents the study findings, including the statistical analyses and data classes. Section 6 presents the Challenges and Limitations, followed by the conclusion to summarize the main findings and their implications. | Background: LULC classification is a fundamental tool for understanding the spatial distribution of land features and their associated character-istics. Accurate LULC classification is essential for various land management, natural resource management, and urban planning applications. Due to the rapid advancement of RS technology, high-resolution images are now available with a wide range of spectral and spatial resolutions, allowing for accurate and timely land cover classification. However, due to the complexity of land features, the classification of LULC remains challenging. A key factor affecting the accuracy of LULC classification is the selection of features for classification. There are many classification methods. The following sections briefly describe the classification and feature selection methods.
The three main methods for classifying LULC objects using RS and GIS are satellite imagery, spectral analysis, and digital terrain analysis. First, satellite imagery involves using satellites to acquire images of land surfaces from different angles. These images are then processed and analyzed to identify and classify LULC objects. The data collected can include details such as elevation, vegetation, and soil type. Second, spectral analysis is used to identify and classify LULC objects using electromagnetic radiation (EMR) emitted from these objects. This technique uses different wavelengths of EMR, such as infrared, visible light, and thermal imaging, to detect and characterize different LULC objects. Third, digital terrain analysis involves using computer algorithms and GIS software to analyze and classify LULC objects. This technique is used to create detailed contour maps and 3D models of terrain in order to classify and identify LULC objects accurately. | Literature review: Various studies have been conducted to classify and update LULC information in different regions using RS and GIS technology with varying levels of success  | Materials and methods: The workflow diagram of this study can be illustrated in Fig.  | Study area: The study area is in Saudi Arabia's Northern Border Region (NBR), along the borders with Iraq and Jordan. It consists of several towns, villages, land, and semi-arid areas. The elevation of the area is 536 m above sea level. The GPS coordinates of NBR are 30.975 and 41.038, and its longitude is 41.016666. 30¬∞59 0 0.0024 00 N and 41¬∞0 0 59.9976 00 E (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arar,_Saudi_ Arabia). Its population is 395,000 (the year 2014 census). It is recognized for its fertile grazing plains. The Saudi Arabian Highway 85 passes through NBR, a significant supply stop connecting Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Fig.  | Dataset collection: The dataset consists of RS imageries of NBR's maps from 1990 to 2022. It was extracted using Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 from various satellite images repository like Google Earth Pro, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) 1 and (diva) 2 website. These images were clear of cloud cover. Table  | Pre-processing: Data pre-processing is an essential part of LULC classification, as it affects the accuracy of the resulting classification outputs. Data pre-processing is a method used prior to LULC classification to optimize the accuracy of the classification results. It helps the data to be improved to provide better results. Data pre-processing encompasses various stages, such as radiometric corrections, data enhancement, and spatial filtering, which are essential for obtaining more accurate classifications. Radiometric corrections are performed to compensate for sensor gain and offset effects, which can adversely affect the LULC classification results. The primary radiometric corrections used in LULC classification are signal-to-noise ratio adjustment and histogram equalization. The signal-to-noise ratio adjustment minimizes the variation so that the output image has a more even signal distribution. Histogram equalization compensates for the non-uniform luminance distribution in regions with varying illumination intensity by redistributing the pixel values across the entire dataset.
It is crucial to pre-process the RS data to correct the radiometric and geometric inaccuracy that occurs during acquisition, scanning, and transmission. The pre-processing steps include clipping maps, image registration, geo-referencing, radiometric correction, image enhancement, campsite bands, and layout maps. These steps improve image quality and remove noise sources, providing a more reliable dataset. The steps are described as follows: i) Clipping maps are used to cut out specific regions of interest from the original images. It is done by cutting out unneeded background information, allowing images to be analyzed more precisely. ii) Image registration is a process of aligning images of different areas together, allowing similar features to be compared. It can also match the coordinate systems of two images taken at the exact location  | No. Class Description:  | 1.: Bare land Bare soil and land do not contain the population of people like the desert. | Built-up Area: The built area can be a large or small building. | Rocks: Mountains or bare rocks 4.

images to be compared, helping to identify detailed changes in the LULC features over time. Figures  | Results & discussion: To classify the re-travel segmented images. We used maximum likelihood classification (MLC) to classify images based on specific features. Eq. ( 
Where: x = n-dimensional data (where n is the number of bands); i = class; p(x i ) = probability that class x i occurs in the image and is assumed the same for all classes; |R i | = determinant of the covariance matrix of the data in class x i ; R i -1 = its inverse matrix; m i = mean vector.
This study recognized four classes: bare land, Built-up area, rocks, and vegetation. The classes' details are described in Table 
All LULC classes in the northern border region from year to year have changed. The built-up area increased from 1990 with 21 km 2 wide to 2022 with 132 km 2 wide area. Vegetation also increased from 1990 at 1 km 2 wide to 2022 at 23 km 2 wide. Changes that happened to Rocks and Bare Land are not increased or decreased constantly. The possibility that made it happen is because the satellite captured rocks covered by sand or vice versa.
The built-up area class experienced the most significant change in NBR. The results showed that urban areas increased by approximately 628% between 1990 and 2022. It is a predictable situation because the increment of human activity, such as construction and urban development, will continue to drive growth. The built-up area in NBR is shown in Fig. 
Our work on developing a map for land use and land cover classification of the Northern Border Region using remote sensing and GIS is an important contribution to the field of environmental monitoring and natural resource management. Our approach utilizes advanced remote sensing and GIS techniques to achieve a higher accuracy of land use and land cover classification, which is essential for sustainable land management, natural resource conservation, and environmental monitoring.
Our approach has several potential applications in different fields, such as urban planning, agricultural management, and biodiversity conservation. In urban planning, accurate land use and land cover classification maps can be used to identify areas suitable for development, estimate population density, and monitor changes in the built environment. In agricultural management, such maps can be used to identify land use patterns and estimate crop yields, which can inform decisions on land use planning and resource allocation. In biodiversity conservation, our approach can be used to identify areas with high ecological value and potential threats to biodiversity, which can inform conservation strategies.
This work also contributes to the ongoing efforts to monitor and understand the land use and land cover changes in the Northern Border Region. Such information is essential for policymakers, land managers, and researchers to develop effective strategies to promote sustainable land use practices and natural resource conservation. | Accuracy assessment: The confusion matrix of ground truth data and the Kappa coefficient were used to assess accuracy. Ground-truth data were gathered from fieldwork carried out in NBR. A confusion matrix is a popular tool for evaluating LULC classification techniques' accuracy 
The accuracy assessment with the confusion matrix often offers more profound insights into the results of the classification pro- Main Cities Towns and villages cess, making it a valuable tool for LULC classification tasks. Additionally, it can be used to compare the performance of different techniques or assess the accuracy of a particular technique concerning a reference classifier. The confusion matrix results are described in Tables 
Where: N is the total number of classified values compared to truth values; i is the class number; m i,i is the number of values belonging to the truth class i that have also been classified as class i; G i is the total number of truth values belonging to class i; C i is the total number of predicted values belonging to class i.
Table  | Challenges and limitations: While the current developments in RS and GIS LULC classification are promising, there are still limitations and challenges. First, the accuracy of collected data can vary depending on the type of equipment used and the environment in which the data was collected. Due to the nature of the classification process and the challenges of detecting small-scale land-use changes, there is a need to improve the accuracy of the classification process. It can be achieved by deploying more sophisticated RS platforms and algorithms. For example, one future direction is combining many machine learning and deep learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of LULC classification. Furthermore, multimodal data fusion can be applied to improve the quality of classification algorithms, and pixel-based classification techniques can be used to analyze subtle changes in LULC at a fine scale. Second, data acquisition and processing costs can be high, making it difficult for smaller organizations or researchers to obtain the resources needed to carry out the analysis. Finally, the resolution of the imagery can be limited, making it difficult to detect small LULC objects accurately. | Conclusions: This study aimed to investigate LULC changes in NBR over the past three decades to understand the patterns and drivers of LULC. The study utilized RS data from Landsat imagery between 1990 and 2022 and conducted a time-series analysis to detect changes over time. Four classes were identified: bare land, built-up area, rocks, and vegetation. The results showed that there had been a significant increase in urbanization and a decrease in bare soil and green spaces during this period. Most of the urbanization occurred in the outskirts of the cities, where previously there was bare soil. The main driver of urbanization was population growth and economic development. The finding showed how human factors and processes have greatly affected the shapes and disappearance of many forms of the Earth's surface between 1990 and 2022. The study provides a reliable baseline for monitoring changes in the LULC of the study area and can be used as a starting point in other studies that involve a change in land cover in the NBR. The outcomes show that the classification scheme accurately mapped the NBR's LULC classes, with an overall accuracy of 92.6% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.90. This study demonstrated the usefulness of remote sensing and GIS techniques for mapping and monitoring LULC change dynamics in the Northern Border Region over an extended period of time. However, the limitations and challenges identified in this study also highlight the need for more advanced techniques to predict LULC change dynamics in the future. Therefore, it is recommended that future studies in the region should explore more advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, such as deep learning, to improve the accuracy and efficiency of LULC classification and prediction. In addition, incorporating ancillary data sources, such as socioeconomic and environmental variables, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the driving factors of LULC change in the region. Such studies would not only advance our knowledge of LULC dynamics in the region but also inform effective land management and planning strategies for sustainable development. | Declaration of

"Land Use/Land Cover Change Impact on Hydrological Process in the Upper Baro Basin, Ethiopia",Tewodros Getu Engida; Tewodros Nigussie; Abreham Aneseyee; John Barnabas,"Understanding the hydrological process associated with Land Use/Land Cover (LU/LC) change is vital for decision-makers in improving human wellbeing. LU/LC change significantly affects the hydrology of the landscape, caused by anthropogenic activities. e scope of this study is to investigate the impact of LU/LC change on the hydrological process of Upper Baro Basin for the years 1987, 2002, and 2017. e Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)  model was used for the simulation of the streamflow. e required data for the SWAT model are soils obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization; Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and LU/LC were obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). e meteorological data such as Rainfall, Temperature, Sunshine, Humidity, and Wind Speeds were obtained from the Ethiopian National Meteorological Agency. Data on discharge were obtained from Ministry of Water, Irrigation and Electricity. Ecosystems are deemed vital. Landsat images were used to classify the LU/LC pattern using ERDAS Imagine 2014 software and the LU/LC were classified using the Maximum Likelihood Algorithm of Supervised Classification. e Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2) global sensitivity method within SWAT Calibration and Uncertainty Procedures (SWAT-CUP) was used to identify the most sensitive streamflow parameters. e calibration was carried out using observed streamflow data from 01 January 1990 to 31 December 2002 and a validation period from 01 January 2003 to 31 December 2009. LU/LC analysis shows that there was a drastic decrease of grassland by 15.64% and shrubland by 9.56% while an increase of agricultural land and settlement by 18.01% and 13.01%, respectively, for 30 years. e evaluation of the SWAT model presented that the annual surface runoff increased by 43.53 mm, groundwater flow declined by 27.58 mm, and lateral flow declined by 5.63 mm. e model results showed that the streamflow characteristics changed due to the LU/LC change during the study periods 1987-2017 such as change of flood frequency, increased peak flows, base flow, soil erosion, and annual mean discharge. Curve number, an available water capacity of the soil layer, and soil evaporation composition factor were the most sensitive parameters identified for the streamflow. Both the calibration and validation results disclosed a good agreement between measured and simulated streamflow. e performance of the model statistical test shows the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) and Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) efficiency values 0.87 and 0.81 for calibration periods of 1990-2002 and 0.84 and 0.76 for the validation period of 2003 to 2009, respectively. Overall, LU/LC significantly affected the hydrological condition of the watershed. erefore, different conservation strategies to maintain the stability and resilience of the ecosystem are vital.","Introduction: e response of hydrologic circulation is closely related to land use planning and management 
is can be either by increasing the water yield or by eliminating the flow in some circumstances, thereby increasing the sediment load and decreasing the groundwater 
LU/LC changes and population growth are the most common problems in developing countries such as Ethiopia since their economic development mainly depends on agriculture 
e modifications/conversions of natural vegetation and physical soil conditions are usually the principal cause of changes in rainfall-runoff characteristics of the local catchment, which consequently change the river flow regimes 
Watershed studies can provide direct evidence of LU/ LC change impacts on runoff 
e Upper Baro Basin is hurt from human-induced degradation mainly due to large-scale agricultural expansion, which leads to LU/LC dynamism. e impacts of such changes on local hydrology are poorly understood. Hence, systematic analyses and understanding the impacts of LU/ LC changes on the watershed hydrology are important for planning water resources management and maintaining the sustainable flow of water to the Baro-Akobo River. is study also helps decision-makers know where to invest to conserve the hydrological services.
erefore, the objectives of the study are as follows: (1) to assess the LU/LC change over the past 30 years on the hydrological response of Upper Baro Basin and (2) to check the applicability of SWAT model for the study area. | Materials and Methods:  | e Study Area.: e Upper Baro Basin is found in southwestern Ethiopia located at 766 km away from Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia, between latitudes 7.44 ¬∞and 9.41 ¬∞N and longitudes 34.52 ¬∞and 36.31 ¬∞E, covering an area of 23462 km 2 . e altitude ranged from 390 m to 3266 m above sea level (Figure 
e Upper Baro basin has a long rainy season in the months of May-September. e area indicates a monomodal, bimodal, and triple-modal rainfall pattern. e annual average rainfall is varying from about 1163.03 mm to over 2258.36 mm with a monthly maximum rainfall record of 302.79 mm in August, while relative mean monthly rainfall for dry seasons occurs between December and March (Figure 
e topography of the Upper Baro Basin is characterized by variation from flat to mountainous terrain and falls in the altitude range of 390 m to over 3000 m a.m.s.l. with 42% in between 1000 m and 2000 m a.m.s.l. e eastern two-thirds of the basin area lies between 1000 m and 2400 m a.m.s.l. and a gently sloping plain lies in the west between 380 m and 500 m a.m.s.l. Dystric nitisols and dystric gleysols are the dominant soil type in the study area. | SWAT Model Data Types and Analysis:  | Meteorological Data.: e SWAT model requires daily meteorological (Weather) data such as daily precipitation, minimum and maximum air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, dew point, and daily sunshine. e standard deviation of each parameter was calculated. iessen method is used to adjust for nonuniform meteorological station distribution by proportion to the area which is closer. Eleven meteorological stations were selected (Table 
ese data were obtained from the National Meteorological Agency of Ethiopia (NMAE) over the period . e missing values were estimated from other stations around the missed record station by using both arithmetic mean method and normal ratio method and also consistency test which shows double mass.
e SWAT weather generator model (WGEN) was used to match the access table and lookup table. e daily precipitation and temperature of all gauging stations were prepared in comma-delimited (.csv) format. Solar radiation, relative humidity, and wind speed data were available only for principal Gore and Masha stations (synoptic stations).   | Soil: ey were radiometrically calibrated to reflectance value and the Quick Atmospheric Correction algorithm was applied in ERDAS software. Radiometric and geometric corrections were applied to the removal of sensor noise, haze, correction data loss, and missing lines due to a solar position, satellite calibration 
Overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient, the classify maps will check classification accuracy. According to 
e SWAT Model has predetermined four-letter codes for each LU/LC category (Table  | SWAT Model Description.: SWAT is a physically based semidistributed continuous time-scale hydrological model, which works on a daily time step. is model can simulate runoff, sediment, nutrients, pesticide, and bacterial transport from agricultural watersheds 
where SW t and SW o are the final and initial soil water content, respectively, (mm), Q i ÔøΩ daily surface runoff (mm), R i ÔøΩ daily rainfall (mm), ET i ÔøΩ daily evapotranspiration (mm), R i ÔøΩ daily lateral flow (mm), and P i ÔøΩ daily percolation (mm). | Peak Runoff Rate.: e peak runoff rate is a result of the erosive power of a storm and is used to predict sediment loss. SWAT calculates the peak runoff rate with a modified rational method for each HRU using the following equation:
where Q peak is peak runoff rate (m 3 /s), Œ± tc the fraction of daily rainfall that occurs during the time of concentration, Q surf is the surface runoff (mm), A is the sub-basin area (km 2 ), and t conc is the time of concentration (hr). | Surface Runoff Generation.: e CN method was initially developed for small agricultural watersheds and the CN varies nonlinearly with the moisture content of the soil. It drops to zero as the soil approaches the wilting point and increases to be near 100 as the soil approaches saturation, with higher CNs associated with higher runoff potential watershed. is method is widely used 
According to USDA, 1985 
where Q s is the accumulated runoff (mm), Ra is the rainfall depth for the day (mm), and
where CN is the curve number for the day and its value is the function of land use practice, soil permeability and soil hydrologic group. Conceptual framework showing the components and relationships have been used as a framework for the analysis of hydrology in research (Figure  | SWAT Model Simulation, Sensitivity Analysis, Calibration, and Validation.: e simulation result cannot be directly used for further analysis. Instead, the ability of the model to sufficiently predict the constituent streamflow should be evaluated through sensitivity analysis, model calibration, and model validation 
2.6.1. Sensitivity Analysis. Fifteen hydrological parameters related to streamflow were selected for sensitivity analysis in the study area.
e sensitivity of each parameter was identified using the T test and P values. P values were used to determine the significance of the sensitivity. A value close to zero has more significance. T test provides a measure of sensitivity and the most sensitive parameters usually appear with P values less than the alpha level of 0.05 (larger absolute values are more sensitive)  | Model Calibration and Validation.: e SUFI-2 algorithm was applied and frequently used in this study of calibration for the SWAT model at a large scale due to its easy application and the reduced number of model runs needed to achieve a decent prediction  | Model Performance Evaluation.: Model performance was carried out to verify the robustness of the model to simulate hydrological processes. A model performance framework proposed by 
Nash and Sutcliffe simulation efficiency (NSE) indicates the degree of fitness of observed and simulated data, and it is calculated using the following equation:
where N ÔøΩ number of compared values, Q obs is the observed data, Q obs is the observed mean, and Q sim is the simulated data. e NSE indicates how well the plot of observed versus simulated value fits the 1 : 1 line. e closer the model efficiency is to 1, the more accurate the model, and if it is found between 0 and 1, it indicates deviations between measured and predicted values. If NSE is negative, predictions are poor, and the average value of output is a better estimate than the model prediction 
Coefficient of determination (R 2 ) measures the ability of a model to predict or explain an outcome in the linear regression setting (Equation ( 
where X i is measured value, X av is average measured value, Y i is simulated value, and Y av is the average simulated value. Percent bias (PBIAS) measures the average difference between the simulated and measured values for a given quantity over a specified period (usually the entire calibration or validation period) and it is calculated using the following equation 
where X i is measured value and Y i is simulated value. Model evaluation classifies as follows:
(i) 0.75 < NSE < 1.00, PBIAS < ¬±10-better predictor (ii) 0.65 < NSE ‚â§ 0.75, ¬±10 < PBIAS < ¬±15-good (iii) 0.50 < NSE ‚â§ 0.65, ¬±15 < PBIAS < ¬±25-satisfactory (iv) (NSE ‚â§ 0.50, PBIAS >¬±25)-unsatisfactory   | Results and Discussion: e results obtained for 1987-2002 reveal that forest land covers 36.74% and followed by grassland, 19.77% and shrubland and woodland also cover 19.76% and 11.32%, respectively. Between 2002 and 2017, the distribution of forest cover demonstrates highest in the catchment, which covered 33.33%, followed by agricultural land and shrubland, with the value of 15.6%, 15.1%, respectively. Forest land and shrubland decreased after 1987-2002, with -3.41% and -4.65%, respectively (Figure 
In the last 30 years, the study displays an increase in agriculture, bare land, urban, and shrubland, whereas the forest, grassland, water, and wetland were noted declined. Agricultural land increased by 18.01% during the study period. is is due to the increase of population growth that causes the increase in demand for cultivation land for different agricultural products like cereal crops, field crops, industrial crops, whereas the forest area was diminished.
is might be due to deforestation activities that have taken place for agriculture and urban expansion.
Consequently, agricultural investment policies encouraged further deforestation that leads to land conversion 
In this study, the accuracy assessment was performed using the 340 referenced points collected through stratified sampling. Overall accuracies obtained were 92.14%, 94.63%, and 95.93% for the 1987, 2002, and 2017 images, respectively (Table  | Stream Flow Modeling Using SWAT: 3.2.1. Sensitivity Analysis. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to identify which model parameter was the most important or sensitive. Flow sensitivity analysis was carried out for 13 years, the calibration period (from January 1, 1990, to  | SWAT Model Calibration and Validation.: e simulated monthly flows demonstrated a good agreement with the monthly observed discharge of Upper Baro Basin with a coefficient of determination (R 2 ÔøΩ 0.86), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE ÔøΩ 0.80), and percent bias (PBIAS ÔøΩ -17%) (Figure 
SWAT model also successfully validated streamflow for an independent period (2003-2010) with R 2 ÔøΩ 0.84, NS ÔøΩ 0.76, and PBIAS ÔøΩ -4.5% during the validation period; the values fulfilled the statistical model performance criteria R 2 > 0.6 and NSE > 0.5 recommended by SWAT developer 
e percent bias (PBAIS) values (-17% and 4.5%) during calibration and validation periods, respectively, also fulfilled the statistical model performance criteria PBAIS> ¬±15 
Generally, the above information showed that the performance of the model was better during the calibration period more than the validation period (Table  | Land Use/Land Cover Change Response to Hydrological: Process.
e simulated results of the Upper Baro Basin under different land use/land cover scenarios are shown in Table  | Mean Monthly Wet and Dry Month Streamflow Simulation and eir: Variability. Months July, August, and September were considered as wet periods and Jan, Feb, and March were considered dry months; these seasonal variabilities of streamflow were evaluated. | Spatial Variability of Surface Runoff over Sub-Basin.: Spatial variability of surface runoff shows that surface runoff is highly sensitive to the change of LU/LC over subwatersheds in the period of 1987, 2002, and 2017 (Figure  | Comparison of Mean Monthly Surface Runoff and: Groundwater. Decreases in base flow had a potential effect on the change in annual river flow (Figure  | Conclusions: In the present study, the Upper Baro Basin has been simulated using the SWAT hydrological model for assessing the impact of LULC change on its hydrological regime successfully. Initially, the change in LULC between the years 1987, 2002, and 2017 has been assessed. It is evident that land cover changes had occurred between 1987 and 2017. Forest cover had decreased from 36.74% to 31.21%, attributable to logging for timber, firewood, and clearing for agricultural purposes. In contrast, the agricultural area increased over the years from 8.81% to 26.81%. Similarly, grasslands and bushes have also been converted to agricultural areas. Sensitivity analysis of the SWAT parameters indicates that runoff is most sensitive to curve number, an available water capacity of the soil layer, soil evaporation composition factor, manning's ""n"" value for the main channel, and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Seasonal streamflow variability due to the LU/LC was assessed and comparisons were made on surface runoff, lateral flow, and groundwater flow contributions to streamflow based on the three simulation outputs. Surface runoff was increased from 713.85 mm to 760.49 mm, while groundwater was decreased from 283.21 mm to 257.13 mm in the years 1987 and 2017. Also, surface runoff was increased from 737.67 mm to 760.49 mm, while groundwater was decreased from 266.32 mm to 257.13 mm in the year 2002 and 2017. Land use/land cover change over the last 30 years also affect the soil and soil properties in the study area significantly. For example, forest land declined and agricultural land is increased. is dynamism would maximize soil erosion, which leads to the loss of important soil nutrients. erefore, different soil and water conservation measures are required to reverse the challenges.

Remote Sensing of Environment,Dizhou Guo; Wenzhong Shi; Ming Hao; Xiaolin Zhu,"Spatiotemporal fusion is a feasible solution to resolve the tradeoff between the temporal and spatial resolutions of remote sensing images. However, the development of spatiotemporal fusion algorithms has not yet reached maturity, and existing methods still face many challenges, e.g., accurately retrieving land cover changes and improving the robustness of fusion algorithms. The Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) method proposed by Zhu et al. in 2016 solved the abovementioned problems to some extent. However, FSDAF has two shortcomings that can be further improved: (1) FSDAF is prone to losing spatial details and predicting a ""blurrier"" image due to the input of coarse pixels containing type change information and a large amount of boundary information for unmixing calculation, and (2) FSDAF does not optimize the areas of land cover change. In this paper, an improved FSDAF method incorporating change detection technology and an optimized model for changed-type areas (FSDAF 2.0) was proposed to improve the aforementioned problems. Based on the existing FSDAF algorithm, FSDAF 2.0 excludes changed pixels and boundary pixels for unmixing calculation, and establishes a model to optimize the changed pixels. Its performance was compared with that of the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), the original FSDAF, and the enhanced FSDAF that incorporates sub-pixel class fraction change information (SFSDAF). Two sites consisting of landscapes with heterogeneous and large-scale abrupt land cover changes were employed for testing. The results of the experiments demonstrate that FSDAF 2.0 effectively improves the shortcomings of FSDAF, blends synthetic fine-resolution images with higher accuracy than that of the other three methods at two different sites, and strengthens the robustness of the fusion algorithm. More importantly, FSDAF 2.0 has a powerful ability to retrieve land cover changes and provides a feasible way to improve the performance of retrieving land cover changes. Consequently, FSDAF 2.0 has great potential for monitoring complex dynamic changes in the Earth's surface.","Introduction: With the rapid development of remote sensing technology in the past decade, remote sensing has played an increasingly important role in monitoring urbanization 
Moreover, a growing problem currently exists in the use of remote sensing data: the remote sensing community has accumulated a large amount of historical data since the first remote sensing satellite launched. However, due to the influence of thick cloud contamination and other factors (e.g., SLC-off problem in Landsat 7 ETM+), limited remote sensing data can be employed directly, which further increases the difficulty of obtaining dense time series with high spatial resolution data.
To solve the abovementioned problems, launching more satellites or improving the performance of sensors in a short period of time is impractical, while the spatiotemporal fusion of multisource images from multiple satellites to obtain high spatial resolution and dense timeseries data is a feasible solution. Compared with traditional pansharpening fusion, spatiotemporal fusion is a relatively new concept 
Due to a large number of satellite images being freely available to the public (e.g., Landsat, MODIS, and Sentinel) and the large demand for Earth monitoring with high spatial resolution and dense time series, in the last two decades, there has been increasing interest in spatiotemporal fusion. Recently, existing spatiotemporal fusion methods have been classified into five groups based on the specific principle: weight function-based, unmixing-based, Bayesian-based, learning-based, and hybrid methods. A comprehensive review of spatiotemporal fusion methods in these five groups can be found in the literature 
The Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) is the weight function-based method developed first 
Consequently, spatiotemporal fusion technology has developed rapidly, but as a relatively new research topic in the remote sensing field, existing fusion methods based on different principles have their own strengths and weaknesses. The development of spatiotemporal fusion algorithms has not yet reached maturity, and existing solutions still face many challenges, such as the following typical problems. | Difficulty in retrieving land cover changes: Retrieving land cover changes is a difficult problem for spatiotemporal fusion  | Low robustness in different types of landscapes: Currently, existing spatiotemporal fusion algorithms have different advantages and limitations in different landscapes due to their various principles. For example, faced with a site with a heterogeneous landscape, a site with a homogeneous landscape, and a site with large-scale abrupt land cover changes, the blending results of using various spatiotemporal fusion algorithms are quite different; for example, STARFM has promising accuracy in homogeneous landscapes, but it is ineffective in the face of heterogeneous landscapes  | High demand of input data: Many existing spatiotemporal fusion methods, including ESTARFM, STAARCH, STDFA, SPSTFM, etc., need more than one prior coarse-and fine-resolution image pair as input data. For real-time processing, some fusion methods like ESTARFM and STAARCH cannot be used because they need the image after the prediction time. For historical case, due to the influence of thick cloud contamination and other factors, it is difficult to acquire one more high-quality coarse-and fine-resolution image pair that has acceptable temporal distance or does not experience large-scale land cover changes between the image pairs, only one pair of prior images may be available in most cases 
The FSDAF proposed by 
Although FSDAF performs excellently in spatiotemporal fusion, it has two problems that can be improved: (1) in the unmixing process of FSDAF, coarse pixels with change values within the range of the 0.1-0.9 quantiles (or a narrower range, e.g., 0.2-0.8) are selected to participate in the unmixing calculation to filter out the changed pixels. However, this strategy is empirical and not strict. In addition, the coarse pixels containing a large amount of boundary information are not excluded. These pixels would introduce the wrong spectral information into the unmixing calculation once selected. As a result, FSDAF is prone to reducing the contrast between different objects, losing spatial details and predicting a ""blurrier"" image. This problem is particularly acute in the case of the large-scale type change occurring during the fusion period.
(2) FSDAF can capture part of the change information from the coarseresolution image at T 2 by using the TPS interpolation method 
To address the above problems, an improved FSDAF method incorporating change detection technology and an optimized model for changed-type areas (FSDAF 2.0) is proposed in this paper. Its goal is to overcome the disadvantages of FSDAF and solve the three typical problems mentioned above. Specifically, FSDAF 2.0 employs change detection technology to find the changed-type pixels by detecting two coarse-resolution images of different phases and excludes the coarse pixels containing changed-type areas and a large amount of boundary information in the unmixing process. Furthermore, FSDAF 2.0 establishes an optimized model that performs targeted optimization on the prediction values of changed-type pixels. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we compared the performance of FSDAF 2.0 with the STARFM, the original FSDAF, and the enhanced FSDAF that incorporates sub-pixel class fraction change information (SFSDAF)  | Methodology: FSDAF 2.0 only requires one pair of coarse-and fine-resolution images acquired at T 1 and one coarse-resolution image at T 2 . The flowchart of FSDAF 2.0 is shown in Fig. 
FSDAF 2.0 includes four main steps: (1) classify and detect edges; (2) obtain thin plate spline (TPS) interpolation images and detect changed pixels; (3) unmix and obtain the temporal prediction; and (4) optimize and obtain the final prediction. The specific steps and theories of FSDAF 2.0 are as follows: | Classify and detect edges: This step involves acquiring the classification map and the edge image. The fraction of each class within one coarse pixel, which needs to be used in the subsequent unmixing process, can be obtained from the classification map. In this paper, the unsupervised classifier ISODATA is used to classify the fine-resolution image at T 1 . The edge detection algorithm is employed to extract the features of the object boundary, i.e., obtain the edge image of the fine-resolution image at T 1 . For convenience, the edge of the surface is referred to as the ""boundary area"". The fine pixels inside the boundary area are called ""boundary pixels"". The boundary pixels can be found by using the threshold method in the edge image. The boundary pixel is mixed with two or more types of features, generally due to being located at the edges of different objects. Accordingly, its spectral features are quite different from the type to which it belongs. Therefore, the prediction accuracy can be affected once coarse pixels containing a large number of boundary pixels are employed to estimate the temporal change of each class, specifically, increasing the error of the unmixing calculation and reducing the contrast between different objects in the blending image. To avoid the above problems, determining the boundary pixels is a key process. FSDAF 2.0 employs the Sobel operator to obtain the edge image. The pixels in the edge image with values within the range of the 0.96-1.0 quantiles are defined as boundary pixels. | Obtain TPS interpolation images and detect changed pixels: Thin plate spline (TPS) interpolation is a kind of spatial interpolation method based on spatial dependence, and is a tool for interpolating surfaces from scattered datasets. TPS interpolation can produce a ""smooth"" interpolation image and capture the spatial patterns and land cover type change signals. More information about TPS can be found in the literature 
The ability of capturing change information in FSDAF mainly results from the TPS interpolation of coarse-resolution image at T 2 (i.e., spatial prediction). However, FSDAF distributes residuals on the assumption that errors depend mainly on the homogeneity of the surface in step 3. In other words, the original FSDAF does not make targeted optimization to changed-type areas. The lack of this process affects the accuracy and reliability of the blending result when facing a site with land cover type changes. The key to settling this problem is to find the changed-type pixels during the fusion period. Therefore, it is reasonable to employ change detection technology to solve this problem. The selection of the change detection algorithm depends on many factors, e.g., image size, resolution, scale of the type changes, and calculation efficiency. For convenience, the fine pixels that have type changes during the fusion period are referred to as ""changed pixels"", while other pixels are called ""unchanged pixels"".
In this paper, two thresholding algorithms were employed: the thresholding method based on the Gaussian distribution model and OTSU 
where C 1 and C 2 are the coarse-resolution images at T 1 and T 2 , respectively; In most cases, the difference values of remote sensing images in two phases approximately agree with the Gaussian distribution 
where œâ 0 is the ratio of the unchanged pixels to the number of total pixels, œâ 1 is the ratio of the changed pixels to the number of total pixels, Œº 0 is the average value of the unchanged pixels, Œº 1 is the average value of the changed pixels, and Œº is the average value of the total pixels. OTSU employs the traversing method to obtain the threshold values. The thresholds are calculated separately for two cases.
Compared with the Gaussian distribution model, OTSU tends to mistakenly judge phenological changes as classification changes, but it is suitable for detecting areas where the land cover type changes on a large scale. Consequently, FSDAF 2.0 chooses the change detection algorithm according to whether the difference values of TPS interpolation result in two phases in accordance with the Gaussian distribution model. There are many methods that can judge whether the difference values agree with the Gaussian distribution model, such as the Shapiro-Wilk test 
In the above threshold calculation, coarse-resolution images are used instead of TPS interpolation images. We found that there is negligible difference between the threshold values obtained by using interpolation images and coarse-resolution images as input. This strategy effectively reduces the calculation amount. After thresholds are obtained, the difference image of two interpolation images is employed to make the change detection binary image. Specifically, the values of pixels in the range of the thresholds are selected as changed pixels.
The specific steps of change detection include (1) acquiring a difference image by subtracting two coarse-resolution images; (2) judging whether the difference values are accordance with the Gaussian distribution model; (3) calculating thresholds; and (4) determining the changed pixels in the difference image of interpolation images. In this paper, the thresholds of each band are obtained, which need to be used to limit the results of the unmixing calculation in step 3. In the change detection process, the shortwave infrared band (e.g., SWIR1 or SWIR2 is chosen in Landsat 7 ETM+) is employed to calculate difference values only. The shortwave infrared band is often employed to distinguish rock  | Unmix and obtain the temporal prediction: This step employs linear unmixing technology to estimate the change value between two phases and then calculate the temporal prediction. In the classification process, the class fractions within a coarse pixel f c (x i , y i ) are acquired. According to the spectral linear unmixing theory, and assuming no type change occurs during the blending period, the temporal change of a coarse pixel is the weighted sum of the temporal change of all classes within it:  
(1, )
Considering that the changed pixels involved in the inversion calculation can affect the accuracy, the original FSDAF excludes the pixels with ŒîC outside of the range of the 0.1-0.9 quantiles. This strategy is empirical and has no theoretical basis. Instead, FSDAF 2.0 excludes the changed pixels according to the result of change detection in step 2 and limits the change value of class ŒîF in the closed interval [Q neg , Q pos ]. Furthermore, FSDAF 2.0 takes into account the effect of boundary pixels, and coarse pixels containing more than 10% of boundary pixels are also excluded. The process of filtering pixels is shown in Fig. 
After the calculation of temporal change is completed, and the change value of each class is assigned to fine pixels in the T 1 phase of the corresponding class, and the temporal prediction can be obtained. | Optimize and obtain the final prediction: Similar to FSDAF, FSDAF 2.0 distributes residuals on the assumption that errors depend mainly on the homogeneity of the surface. Consequently, the change value of each class is corrected. However, the above calculation is on a pixel-by-pixel basis; thus, the neighborhood information is employed to reduce the block effect and obtain a more robust prediction F c . The specific processes of distributing residuals and using neighborhood information to obtain robust prediction can be found in the literature 
Theoretically, the TPS interpolation result of the coarse-resolution image at T 2 preserves most of the actual information of the fine-resolution image at T 2 in homogeneous areas. In that case, using the TPS interpolation result to replace the changed pixels is a reasonable optimization method. The TPS interpolation result, however, only uses the spatial dependence of the coarse pixels, which means it produces a ""smooth"" result. Compared with the real fine-resolution image at T 2 , the TPS interpolation result loses many spatial details, and may lead to many spectral and structural errors. In addition, the spectral differences between two sensor platforms should also be considered. Therefore, replacing the changed pixels directly by TPS interpolation results is not rigorous.
To address this problem, FSDAF 2.0 proposes the TPS reliability coefficient (TRC) to describe the reliability degree to which the changed pixels are replaced by the TPS interpolation result. The similarity, homogeneity and consistency index between two images in different phases are used to calculate the TPS reliability coefficient.
The similarity index (SI) describes the spectral similarity between the TPS interpolation image and the real fine-resolution image. Specifically, the similarity index not only describes the difference in pattern between the fine-resolution image and TPS interpolation image but also reflects the spectral difference of different sensor platforms. Theoretically, more similarity between the real image and TPS interpolation image leads to more reliable employment of the TPS interpolation result at T 2 to correct the changed pixels. Logically, the values of SI in the T 2 phase need be obtained. However, the fine-resolution image at T 2 is unknown; instead, the images at T 1 are employed to calculate the SI. Before calculating the similarity index, the difference values of the TPS interpolation image and fine-resolution image at T 1 need to be obtained, as shown in the following equation:
(5)
where (x ij , y ij , b) is the coordinate index of the jth fine pixel within the coarse pixel at location (x i , y i ) in band b, F 1 TPS (x ij , y ij , b) is the value of the TPS interpolation result at T 1 , and F 1 (x ij , y ij , b) is the value of the fine-resolution image in T 1 phase.
To simplify the calculation, we assume that the difference values F d (x ij , y ij , b) are in accordance with the Gaussian distribution model and consider that there is no spectral similarity between the TPS interpolation image and the real image when the difference value is beyond the triple standard deviations of the average difference. In that case, the similarity index is 0. For other changed pixels, the calculation process is as follows:
where mean(F d ) is the average difference value in band b, stddev(F d ) is the standard deviation of the difference value in band b. The SI ranges from 0 to 1, and larger values indicate more spectral similarity between the TPS interpolation image and the real image.
The homogeneity index reflects the complexity of the land surface. Logically, the higher the homogeneity of the image is, the less spatial details the surface has; thus, less information can be lost by TPS interpolation. In that case, it is more suitable to use the TPS interpolation result to modify the value of the changed pixel. FSDAF 2.0 uses a modified version of the homogeneity index in the original FSDAF to describe the homogeneity of the fine-resolution image in the T 1 phase:
where I p = 1 means the pth fine pixel within a moving window with the same land cover type as the central pixel (x ij , y ij ); otherwise, I p = 0. k is the number of fine pixels within one coarse pixel; MHI ranges from 0 to 1, and larger values indicate a more homogenous landscape 
Because the similarity index and homogeneity index at the prediction phase cannot be calculated without the fine-resolution image of the T 2 phase, instead, the similarity index and homogeneity index mentioned above are the values of the T 1 phase. These indexes of the two phases are different mainly because of the land cover changes. The reliability of the blending result cannot be guaranteed by using the calculated value of the T 1 phase to correct the values of the changed pixels. To solve this problem, the consistency index (CI) of the two coarse-resolution images is proposed to reflect the consistency of the spatial information and structural relations in different phases. A larger consistency index indicates a smaller change in the internal spatial relation between two phases; furthermore, a larger index means that the similarity index and homogeneity index of the two phases are closer. The calculation formula of CI is as follows:
where stddev(C 1 ) is the standard deviation of the coarse-resolution image value in band b at T 1 and stddev(C 2 ) is the standard deviation of the values of the coarse-resolution image in band b at T 2 . The standard deviation can describe the internal relationship characteristics of the image data. Theoretically, CI can reflect the changes in the internal characteristics of the two phases.
The TPS reliability coefficient TRC is the product of the similarity index, homogeneity index and consistency index, as follows:
The list optimization model for changed pixels is as follows:
where (x ij , y ij , b) is the index of the changed pixel, F c (x ij , y ij , b) is the value of the changed pixel in the robust prediction, and F 2 TPS (x ij , y ij , b) is the TPS interpolation result in the coarse-resolution image at T 2 , i.e., the spatial prediction. After optimizing each changed pixel, the final synthetic image is obtained. | Testing experiment:  | Study area and data: FSDAF 2.0 was tested by two challenging landscapes that were intercepted from Irina V. Emelyanova's open spatiotemporal fusion experimental data 
The heterogeneous site is located in the southern part of New South Wales, Australia (145.0675¬∞E, 34.0034¬∞S), as shown in Fig. 
The site with large-scale abrupt land cover changes is located in the northern part of New South Wales, Australia (149.2818¬∞E, 29.0855¬∞S), as shown in Fig. 
There were four images from each landscape: two pairs of Landsat and MODIS images at T 1 and T 2 . The Landsat image at T 2 was employed to compare the experimental results and calculate the blending accuracy. All experimental images were pre-processed for radiation calibration and atmospheric correction before experimentation. | Comparison and evaluation: The performance of FSDAF 2.0 was compared with that of the STARFM, FSDAF and SFSDAF algorithms. Each method requires the same input data: one pair of coarse-and fine-resolution images and one coarse-resolution image in the prediction phase. Blended images predicted by the four methods were compared with the real image in the T 2 phase visually and quantitatively in this section. It should be noted that SFSDAF only participated in the comparison of inputting simulated MODIS-like images in experiment 2. Because SFSDAF requires the input MODIS pixel should be the original pixel, while the process of resampling MOD09GA images to 25 m may incorrectly determine the range of the MODIS pixel. This registration error could affect the final result of SFSDAF.
Visual analysis of the fusion results was used to judge the similarity between the synthetic image and the real image in the spectrum and structure of objects by visual comparison, with the purpose of comprehensively evaluating the advantages of the improved algorithm.
To achieve quantitative analysis, three precision indexes were proposed to reflect different aspects of accuracy. The root mean square error (RMSE) was used to gauge the difference between the predicted reflectance and the actual reflectance and describe the overall errors in the spectrum. The visual assessment index structure similarity (SSIM) was used to evaluate the similarity of the overall structure between the real and blended images. In addition, the correlation coefficient (r) was used to show the linear relationship between the predicted and actual reflectance. Theoretically, a smaller value of RMSE and larger values of SSIM and r indicate a more accurate blending result. | Results:  | Blending results and evaluation in a heterogeneous landscape: In this experiment, there was no distinct type change in the heterogeneous images but rapid phenological changes between two time periods. Therefore, the experimental comparison of blended heterogeneous images focused on the observation of the ecosystem dynamics and overall improvement of FSDAF 2.0 over the original FSDAF. In addition, this experiment also tested the robustness of FSDAF 2.0 and its performance in blending real MODIS images.
The blending results are shown in Fig. 
The quantitative evaluation data of the experimental results are shown in Table 
The quantitative evaluation data of the experimental results are shown in Table  | Discussion: The proposed spatiotemporal data fusion model FSDAF 2.0 shows satisfactory performance in two experiments. In particular, compared with the original FSDAF, FSDAF 2.0 can more accurately capture the ecosystem dynamics and changing type boundaries of objects and retain more details. In this section, a theoretical comparison of the rationale behind the key steps in retrieving land cover changes between FSDAF and FSDAF 2.0 and how FSDAF 2.0 outperforms FSDAF are discussed. Moreover, a comparative experiment of the various steps in FSDAF and FSDAF 2.0 was added. In addition, the efficiency of the algorithm should be considered in the application; thus, a computation time comparison among the four methods was discussed. Finally, we discussed the further improvement of FSDAF 2.0. | Comparison of the processes of FSDAF and FSDAF 2.0 in retrieving land cover changes: The results of experiment 2 in section 4 demonstrate that both FSDAF and FSDAF 2.0 have the ability to retrieve land cover changes. The ability of FSDAF to retrieve changed pixels is mainly come from the spatial prediction. Theoretically, spatial prediction describes the information of the real surface in the T 2 phase, which can maintain the signals of land cover type change and local variability in the fusion result 
The reconversion capability of FSDAF 2.0 comes from the spatial prediction and the optimization model for the changed pixels. FSDAF 2.0 employs edge detection technology and change detection technology to exclude the coarse pixels that contain changed pixels or more than 10% of the boundary pixels. As a result, FSDAF 2.0 obtains more accurate predicted values in the area where the types of objects are unchanged. These differences are the main reason why FSDAF 2.0 obtains more details and more accurate spectral information than the original FSDAF. In addition, FSDAF 2.0 establishes an optimization model for changed areas in the final step to offset the error caused by  unreasonable assumptions in the residual distribution process. Theoretically, FSDAF 2.0 can achieve higher accuracy. To demonstrate the above points explicitly, a comparison of various steps in FSDAF and FSDAF 2.0 to retrieve land cover changes was added. As shown in Fig.  | Comparison of computation time: The computation times of the four methods in section 4 are shown in Table  | Further improvement of FSDAF 2.0: The results of the experiments in section 4 demonstrate that FSDAF 2.0 can obtain satisfactory overall accuracy in two challenging landscapes: heterogeneous and large-scale abrupt land cover changes. The blending results of the improved method have higher overall spectral accuracy, more similar structure and closer correlation to real images, especially in areas where the types of land cover changed. These improvements are due to overcoming the shortcomings of the original FSDAF. Although FSDAF 2.0 has satisfactory performance, it still has the potential to improve.
First, the improvement of FSDAF 2.0 can mainly be achieved through improved temporal prediction and increased targeted optimization in the final step, but the step of obtaining spatial prediction is consistent with that of the original FSDAF; for example, the result of TPS interpolation is used as the spatial prediction. However, the TPS interpolation image is ""smooth"" and loses many spatial details; if the spatial prediction could be replaced by a better scale-down algorithm without consuming too much time, FSDAF could theoretically retain more image details.
Second, similar to FSDAF, FSDAF 2.0 still distributes residuals on the assumption that errors depend mainly on the homogeneity of the surface. This strategy is very empirical and has no theoretical basis. It may not be an optimal way to distribute residuals for different scenarios 
Third, on account of the lack of fine-resolution image in the T 2 phase, FSDAF 2.0 employs the TPS interpolation images of coarse-resolution images in two phases to detect changed areas. Therefore, it is difficult to capture tiny land cover changes. Theoretically, fine-resolution images acquired from other satellites can be employed to solve this problem in the future research process. In addition, long time-series observations or the use of more flexible change detection algorithms can also improve the performance and robustness of FSDAF 2.0. | Conclusions: This study described the theoretical basis, implementation process and performance of an improved flexible spatiotemporal data fusion method incorporating change detection technology and an optimized model for changed-type areas. Landsat and MODIS images of two different sites were employed to test the performance of the improved method. All results demonstrate that FSDAF 2.0 improves the shortcomings of FSDAF, blends synthetic fine-resolution images with higher accuracy in different landscapes, and strengthens the robustness of the algorithm and the ability of retrieving land cover changes compared with those of the original FSDAF algorithm. In addition, FSDAF 2.0 has acceptable efficiency even though it has more steps than the original FSDAF, because effective but fewer computation algorithms were employed in the additional steps.
The key idea of FSDAF 2.0 is using the change detection technology to label the changed pixels. This is a precondition for the subsequent improvement of the unmixing step and targeted optimization, which effectively helps improve the fusion accuracy in changed-type areas. In the spatiotemporal fusion field, retrieving land cover changes is a challenge, and FSDAF 2.0 provides a feasible way to overcome this problem. Moreover, this field has great potential for improvement, such as improving the accuracy of change detection through long time-series observations or using other satellite data to assist in change detection.
Similar to FSDAF and other spatiotemporal methods, FSDAF 2.0 can  also be used to blend other products that are derived from reflectance data, e.g., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), surface temperature and leaf area index. FSDAF has been shown to have high accuracy in fusing other products 
In conclusion, the FSDAF 2.0 algorithm improves the capability for blending fine-resolution remote sensing images, especially for areas of land cover changes. This improvement is beneficial for monitoring the land surface and dynamics of our Earth systems. | Table 4: The computation time of STARFM, FSDAF, SFSDAF and FSDAF 2.0 in two experiments.

Land use and land cover changes along the China-Myanmar Oil and Gas pipelines -Monitoring infrastructure development in remote conflict-prone regions,Thiri Shwesin Aung; Thomas Fischer; John Buchanan,"Energy infrastructures can have negative impacts on the environment. In remote and / or sparsely populated as well as in conflict-prone regions, these can be difficult to assess, in particular when they are of a large scale. Analyzing land use and land cover changes can be an important initial step towards establishing the quantity and quality of impacts. Drawing from very-high-resolution-multi-temporal-satellite-imagery, this paper reports on a study which employed the Random Forest Classifier and Land Change Modeler to derive detailed information of the spatial patterns and temporal variations of land-use and land-cover changes resulting from the China-Myanmar Oil and Gas Pipelines in Ann township in Myanmar's Rakhine State of Myanmar. Deforestation and afforestation conversion processes during pre-and post-construction periods (2010 to 2012) are compared. Whilst substantial forest areas were lost along the pipelines, this is only part of the story, as afforestation has also happened in parallel. However, afforestation areas can be of a lower value, and in order to be able to take quality of forests into account, it is of crucial importance to accompany satellite-imagery based techniques with field observation. Findings have important implications for future infrastructure development projects in conflict-affected regions in Myanmar and elsewhere.","Introduction: Energy development has various potential environmental and social challenges. While coal, oil and gas generation have been the primary focus of research on how landscapes may change, pipeline operations have received less attention. However, over recent years, oil and gas pipelines have undergone substantial expansion globally 
With demand for energy growing very rapidly in China and India, Myanmar, sandwiched between them, has become both, a significant energy source and a transit corridor for energy, in particular fossil fuels. As a result, deals on oil and gas exploration and transmission pipelines are made between Myanmar and the two countries 
While offering multiple economic benefits, there are many environmental (along with social) concerns about oil and gas pipelines as they can affect forest, farmland, and residential areas during construction and operation 
While both, the Myanmar and Chinese governments believe that oil and gas extraction and pipeline projects have the potential to benefit both nations substantially, contributing to significant economic opportunities, there are some grave concerns over their impacts on forests and cultivated lands, as well as on water and wildlife. This can significantly affect the livelihood of local communities 
Environmental governance of large-scale infrastructure projects in this region is often criticized for being weak and projects in Myanmar have been associated with wide-ranging ecological destruction and human rights violations 
Motivated by these concerns, in this paper the authors seek to address critical issues, such as the rate and pattern of LULCC along the pipelines, the extent of forest loss during the study period and the pattern of afforestation in the study area. Adverse impacts of pipelines on Land-Use-Land-Cover (LULC), with a particular focus on forest cover, and the pattern of Land-Use-Land-Cover-Change (LULCC) are reported on.
Myanmar possesses some of the largest remaining forest areas in Asia. Bhagwat et al. (2017) found that 63% of Myanmar was covered by forests in 2014. Nevertheless, the country is suffering from significant annual forest loss due to infrastructure development, firewood overexploitation, illegal logging, shifting cultivation, and an expansion of agricultural lands 
in this context, the country has been said to suffer from limited institutional capacity to deal with these issues  | Study region: The study region is located along the China-Myanmar Oil and Gas Pipelines in Ann township of Kyaukpyu District in Myanmar's western-most state of Rakhine (See Fig 
Land use in the Kyaukpyu District consists of forested and cultivated land, scrubland, nonforested land and cultivable wasteland, as well as protected land area. Some of the land has never been used for cultivation and may or may not be covered by forests. This type of land occupies approximately 53% of the region. Rural, urban, and industrial land use constitutes only 1% of total land use. Over 85% of the households rely on firewood for cooking, and a significant amount of firewood comes from natural forest resources 
Geographically, the area examined in this paper extends from 19Àö49'41.63"" N (elevation 64m) to 19Àö52'26.77"" N (elevation 198m) latitude and 94Àö03'20.57"" E (elevation 333m) to 940 6  | Data and image processing: Diverse datasets are used, including geospatial, socio-economic, demographic, and biophysical data to represent land use and forest cover changes to assess the impact of pipelines on both, ecosystems and livelihoods. The main satellite data used for the classification of Land-Use-Land-Cover-Change (LULCC) are commercial VHRI orthorectified multispectral satellite images, GeoEye-1 and Worldview-2. The satellites are two of the world's highest resolution commercial earth-imaging satellites and offer imageries with 0.5m resolution. GeoEye-1 satellite's positional accuracy is the best of all available satellites today 
Spatial data obtained from the CNPC were used as reference data to manually identify the exact location and route of the pipelines. These were digitized, using Google Earth. In addition, we collected images from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 for 2005, 2010, and 2012 for four representative scenarios in three districts (Kyaukphyu, Mandalay, and Minbu) to validate the pipeline route and the year of construction (see 
Concurrent with the digitization, we conducted field visits to selected sites, during February 2019, for verification and the collection of training samples (Fig 
The training sample covers a total of five land cover and land use categories; (1) forest, (2) scrubland, (3) infrastructure development, (4) residential areas, and (5) agricultural land. This method assures the representation of the samples for each land category 
To quantify Land-Use-Land-Cover-Change (LULCC) associated with the pipelines' operation, primary data from the existing time series from the two commercial VHRI orthorectified satellite images, GeoEye-1 (GeoProfessional) and Worldview-2 were collected 
Finally, land cover land-use change was calculated, and maps were generated, using the Land Change Modeler (LCM) in TerrSet. LCM is the land planning and decision support system that simplifies the complexities of change analysis and allows for rapid analysis of land cover change and model relationships between variables of interest. LCM is an established methodology widely applied in spatially explicit LULCC modeling, trend change analysis, and scenario analysis 
A wide range of geospatial information, such as the pipelines' geographical location, road network, other physical features, affected villages and the geographic boundaries of villages and townships were derived from the databanks of The Humanitarian Data Exchange and Myanmar Information Management Unit's GIS resources.
For the accuracy assessment of the model, RF classification internally estimates accuracy during the bootstrapping process 
In addition, we followed the method developed by 
Where n = number of units, S√∞ √î√û is the standard error of the estimated overall accuracy, Wi is the mapped proportion of the area of class i and S i is the standard deviation of i. S i = ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi ffi
We specify a target standard error for overall accuracy of 0.01. Using proportional approach, we allocated sample size of 10-50 for each change strata. A small overall testing sample size allows for only 10 sample units for some stratum. The estimated variances are them computed based on the sample size allocation. | Results:  | Accuracy assessment: The aim of an accuracy assessment was to evaluate the ability of a model for detecting and delineating LULCC within a study area. Tables  | Land use and land cover change along the pipelines: Maps of the study area from two points in time were analyzed, including pre-(2010) and postconstruction (2012) periods. This way LULCC along the China-Myanmar Oil and Gas Pipelines were established. The maps include designations of five major land cover classes; forests, agriculture, infrastructure development, residential /non-forest areas, and scrubland. The resulting maps for the land-cover classification of pre-and post-construction periods, using   | LULCC modelling results: The increase and decrease of each land use and land cover class can be established more accurately with land change analysis results obtained through the Land Change Modeler (LCM) in TerrSet. Table 
The LULCC map with major land conversion classes, depicting land cover conversion and non-conversion between 2010 and 2012 along the pipelines is shown in Fig 6 . The map identifies a few specific characteristics of LULCC for each land cover and land use type. Table 
Conversely, the transformation of scrubland was mostly associated with forests, accounting to 238 hectares. Additionally, 59 ha of agricultural land, 44.5 ha of infrastructure development  areas, and 19.5 ha of residential areas were converted into forests. This can be attributed to the recent reforestation efforts by the forest department in order to achieve the country's goal of restoring 12 million hectares of forests by 2030 
Fig 
Accordingly, substantial forest conversions took place mainly within the center of the study area where concentrated infrastructure development activities are located, indicating a direct link between the location of the pipelines and the large-scale forest decline. In the center of the study area, surrounding the pipelines, forests to infrastructure development conversion spread more southward, and forest to residential area conversion occurred in the northern part of the study area. Forest to agricultural land and forest to scrubland alterations are concentrated in the center of the map. Meanwhile, the diagrams for overall forest change to all other LULC types and other land types to forests show similar trends with the majority of change happening in the immediate proximity to the pipelines. In the outermost parts of the study area, significantly fewer LULC changes have occurred compared with the center part where the pipelines are located. These results confirm that the magnitude of the impact of infrastructure development by the pipeline are apparent within a 2 km distance / radius. Although the intensity of change can be different given the diverse ecosystem conditions and land cover types across Myanmar, similar occurrence of LULCC can be predicted in other areas along the pipelines. However, future scenarios can change depending on the planning and implementation of mitigation measures to protect forests. | Discussion: Very-high-resolution satellite data were used in the RF classification method and land change modeler to derive detailed LULCC information for analyzing deforestation and afforestation conversion patterns along the China-Myanmar Oil and Gas pipelines between pre-construction (2010) and post-construction (2012) periods. Over the two years, the five investigated land-use types underwent substantial changes along the pipelines. Notably, forests experienced a rapid decline and several conversion patterns. From 2010 to 2012, a large area of forests was converted into anthropogenic use, agricultural land, and scrubland (deforestation) and an extensive area of scrubland and agricultural lands was converted into forests (due to afforestation efforts). The deforestation process mostly resulted from the expansion of infrastructure development (i.e., the construction of pipelines and related activities). Previous studies on the impact of pipelines on forests also found that pipelines contributed to forest losses, although the extent of the impact is likely to depend on the route and the width of the ROW ( 
Anthropogenic drivers, such as the construction of large-scale pipeline projects, are bound to create significant LULC transitions for all land cover classes 
Afforestation at the expense of scrublands and croplands is connected with several forest protection regulations. During the past few years, in a bid to restore forested areas, several regulations were launched in Myanmar, including the National Forest Master Plan, National REDD+ Strategy, and the Myanmar Reforestation and Rehabilitation Program (MRRP). These programs promoted large-scale plantations over the last decade throughout the country, with an estimated 567,000 ha of private commercial plantations. Plantations offer attractive investment opportunities and contribute to meeting the country's reforestation targets. However, it is important that most of these forests constitute lower-value fast-growing wood such as eucalyptus, acacias, fuelwood, and pulp 
As shown in Fig 
Although Myanmar's forests continue to decline, the country does not have appropriate forest management practices for forest restoration and sustainable agricultural use of  | Conclusions: Over recent years, owing to unprecedented region wide economic development, Myanmar's land use and land cover have experienced substantial changes and dramatic forest loss 
The paper addressed three critical questions: (1) What is the rate and pattern of LULCC along the pipelines? (2) How much forests have been lost during the study period? (3) What is the pattern of afforestation in the study area? Analysis reveals that forests have undergone continuous change and have witnessed a dramatic decline leading to the loss of 16.9 hectares of (-2.45% net decline) forest during this two-year period. LULCC included an expansion of anthropogenic disturbances in the form of pipelines construction and residential areas as well as a reduction in forests and scrublands. The transition from forests and scrublands into human development areas is the usual LULCC pattern. Although both, deforestation and afforestation occurred in the area, large-scale development of fast-growing trees appears to dominate forest restoration, i.e. the creation of lower quality ecosystems. Sustainable forest management should emphasize that mitigation of forest fragmentation is needed. According to the classification calculation, most of the forest changes take place infrastructure development. Changes in forested areas were very high near the pipelines, but this dropped off to virtually nil at the edge of the study area, indicating a linear relationship between forest loss and the construction of pipelines.
It can be concluded that over the two-year study period, the LULC rate of change, gains and losses as well as transfer rates are all high, suggesting that the LULC transition is intense along the pipelines given that all changes are related to infrastructure development. The LULCC results from Myanmar offer useful insights for other countries with oil and gas pipelines and transboundary infrastructure. The development of transnational energy projects triggers significant human and environmental security issues throughout the region. Although the discovery of new energy resources can be beneficial, the risks of serious ecosystem degradation from exploration and transportation of energy is high. Future research should assess the impacts of various scenarios of energy development on other environmental changes, such as water contamination, biodiversity depletion, and soil erosion, and harm to human health due to pipeline incidents. What will be of particular importance is to map not just total gains and losses of e.g. forested and agricultural areas, but the differential effects, for example with regards to the creation of lower quality forests.","Erosion from a Cross-Country Natural Gas Pipeline Corridor: The Critical First Year (, , , , 2017) || New Approaches to Building Markets in Asia Working Paper Series (, 2012) || There is no benefit, they destroyed our farmland (, 2011) || EIA Guidelines for Transboundary Natural Gas Pipelines in the Context of Pakistan (, , , 2014) || Oil and Gas Pipeline Construction-Induced Forest Fragmentation and Biodiversity Loss in the Niger Delta (, , 2014) || Earth Rights International (, 2010) || Crude investment: the case of the Yadana Pipeline in Burma (, 1998) || China-Myanmar Energy Cooperation and Its Regional Implications (, 2011) || Another Yadana: The Shwe Natural Gas Pipeline Project (Burma-Bangladesh-Another Yadana: The Shwe Natural Gas Pipeline Project Writing Team: Naing Htoo, Ken MacLean, Ann Putnam (, 2018) || Natural gas pipelines (, 2011) || Troubled Pipelines in Burma (, 2014) || Challenging hydropower development in Myanmar (Burma): cross-border activism under a regime in transition (, 2013) || Environment and Peacebuilding UN Environment Programme' s Experience with Postconflict Assessment (, , 2009) || Rights Groups Call for China to Halt Construction of Pipeline in Burma China must halt oil and gas pipeline projects in Burma (, 2009) || Drawing the Line (, , 2013) || Evaluation of the environmental impact assessment system and implementation in Myanmar: Its signi fi cance in oil and gas industry (, May, 2017) || Evaluation of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) of Chinese EIA in Myanmar: Myitsone Dam, the Lappadaung Copper Mine and the Sino-Myanmar oil and gas pipelines (, , , 2019) || Rapid forest clearing in a Myanmar proposed national park threatens two newly discovered species of geckos (Gekkonidae: Cyrtodactylus) (, 2017) || Untangling the proximate causes and underlying drivers of deforestation and forest degradation in Myanmar (, , , , , 2017) || Myanmar Oil Palm Plantations (, January. 2016) || Political transition and emergent forest-conservation issues in Myanmar (, 2017) || Community Forestry in Myanmar: Some field realities (, 2011) || Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation Formulation and Operationalization of National Action Plan for Poverty Alleviation and Rural Development through Agriculture (NAPA) Working Paper -9 (, 2016) || Forest cover change patterns in Myanmar (Burma) 1990-2000 (, , , , , , 2005) || Analysis of forest deforestation and its driving factors in Myanmar from 1988 to 2017 (, , , , , 2019) || Climate Profile: Climate Variabilities, Extremes and Trends in Central Dry, Coastal and Hilly Zones (, 2018) || Township environmental assessment 2017 (, 2017) || On the road to Kyaukphyu (, 2018) || A Comprehensive Report to better understand the Shwe Project (, 2013) || The Burma-China Pipelines: Human Rights Violations, Applicable Law, and Revenue Secrecy (, 2011) || In search for social justice along the Myanmar-China Oil and Gas Pipelines (, 2016) || Satellite imagery (, 2018.

Prediction of Land Cover Model for Central Ambon City in 2041 Using the Cellular Automata Markov Chains Method,Heinrich Rakuasa; Daniel Sihasale; Glendy Somae; Philia Latue,"The Ambon city center area based on the 2021-2041 RDTR is a center of economic, educational and cultural activities, this makes economic and population growth focused in this region. This also triggers the arrival of residents from other areas to Ambon City and will have an impact on increasing the provision of land for settlements. This condition is expected to trigger land conversion in this area. This study aims to analyze land cover changes in Ambon City in 2001, 2011, 2021 and predict land cover in 2041. This study uses Cellular Automata Markov Chains modeling to predict land cover in the central area of Ambon City in 2041. The results show that the type of built-up land cover and open land continued to increase in area, while agricultural and non-agricultural areas continued to experience a decrease in area and water bodies did not experience a decrease in area. The results of this study are expected to be used as a reference in managing the development of sustainable residential areas and as an effort to arrange land use in the Ambon City center area in the future based on ecological aspects.","INTRODUCTION: Land cover changes are landscape phenomena that play a very important role in environmental changes at the local, national, and global levels 
Each region has a variety of different types of land cover that vary 
Changes in land cover have a significant effect on regional development planning and also on ecosystem functions at all spatial scales, from global to local 
The central area of Ambon City based on the Spatial Detail Plan (RDTR) 2021-2041 is a center of economic, educational and cultural activities, this makes economic growth and population focused in this region. It also triggers the arrival of residents from other regions to Ambon City to settle and have economic activity in Ambon City and will have an impact on increasing the provision of land for settlements. This condition is expected to trigger the transfer of land functions in this area 
Cellular Automata Markov Chains method used to make a model of prediction of land cover in the central area of Ambon City in 2041 which will be compared to the RDTR of the central area of Ambon City in 2041 and the results of this modeling are expected to provide solutions in the structuring of land use in Ambon city in the future that are sustainable based on ecological aspects and can support land use planning and proper land use allocation in addition to conducting conservative activities as a preventive effort in ecologically based land use. Therefore, it is necessary to handle and manage land wisely and sustainably. The study aims to spatially determine land cover changes in the central area of Ambon City in 2012, 2017, 2021 and predict land cover by 2041. | RESEARCH MATERIALS AND METHODS: This research was conducted in the central area of Ambon City, Maluku Province, Indonesia which has a total area based on the spatial detail plan (RDTR) 2021-2041 which is an area of 2,168.89 ha.
(Figure  | Figure 1. Research Location: The Markov Chain model produces a Transition Probability Matrix which is a transition matrix of changes from the previous year to the projected year 
After that, the model accuracy test using K -Standard (Kappa Coefficient) calculations until the value reaches >70% or passes the accuracy test and can be predicted for 2041. Then the results of the simulation in 2041 compared to using RDTR data of central area of Ambon city in 2021-2041 are seen how many matches from the simulation data and RDTR data expected by the Ambon city government. More details of this research workflow described in Figure  | RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:  | Land Cover Development in downtown: Ambon City area in 2001, 2011 and 2021 Built-up land and open land in the central area of Ambon City in the 2001-2021 period continued to experience a significant increase in area, in contrast to types of non-agricultural and agricultural land cover which experienced a reduction in area. This is influenced by the increase in the number of residents in Ambon City in line with the increase in human activities in various sectors, especially the economic sector, so that the need for land resources will also continue to increase. The high population increase in the central area of Ambon city can increase the need for land that is realized in the form of physical development, economic facilities or social facilities. Spatially the area of land cover changes in the central area of Ambon city in 2001, 2011 and 2021 can be seen in Figure  | Land Cover Simulation Model 2021: Modeling the prediction of land cover change in Ambon City in this study was carried out twice, the first modeling was carried out to see the accuracy of the driving factors given to the 2021 land cover model which aims to see the selection of driving factors. The first modeling will produce (Kappa value), where if the kappa value is ‚â•70% then the modeling can be done for the second modeling. For the second modeling is done to predict land cover in 2041 using the same driving factors as the first modeling. The Transition Probability Matrix (TPM) in table 4 is the possibility of changing one land cover class to another.  | Rows in the probability matrix in Table: The results of the 2021 land cover model are then tested for accuracy. The model accuracy test is very important to do to find out whether the first generated model can be applied to produce the second predictive model. Accuracy tests were carried out using existing land cover data for 2021 as reference data  | Land Cover Simulation Model 2041: The complete transition probability matrix to 2041 can be seen in Table 
Based on the results of land cover modeling of the central area of Ambon City in 2041 using the Cellular Automata Markov Chains method can be seen in Figure 
Predictions of land cover changes in the central area of Ambon City in 2041 were made to compare with RDTR land cover of the central Ambon city area in 2021-2041 (Figure 
Increasing the area of residential land in the Central Region of Ambon City from year to year will cause a decrease in the carrying capacity of the environment  | CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that spatially the land cover in the Central Area of Ambon City has undergone significant changes. From 2001, 2011 and 2021, built-up land has continued to increase and increase in area, as well as open land which has increased in area. The direction of development of built-up land tends to follow the topography and road network. In contrast to the cover of agricultural and non-agricultural land, it continues to change into built-up land due to the increasing need for land every year. The prediction results in 2041 show that built-up land will continue to increase in area along with increasing population and demand for land, therefore the results of this study are very useful and can be used as material and input in making policies related to spatial planning and use in the central area of Ambon City in the future. | ACKNOWLEDGMENT: The author is grateful to the Geography Education Study Program which has facilitated researchers in completing research.","Remote Sensing-Based Urban Sprawl Modeling Using Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network Markov Chain in Baghdad, Iraq (, , , , , , , , 2021) || SNI 7645-2010 tentang Klasifikasi Penutup Lahan (, , 2010) || Modeling the Impact of Urbanization on Land-Use Change in Bahir Dar City (, , , , , , 2020) ||  (, ) || Application of Cellular automata and Markov-chain model in geospatial environmental modeling-A review (, , , , , , , , , , , 2017) || The impact of urban growth patterns on urban vitality in newly built-up areas based on an association rules analysis using geographical 'big data (, , , , , , 2018.

Impact of land use/land cover change on the topsoil selenium concentration and its potential bioavailability in a karst area of southwest China,Kongcao Xiao; Junjie Tang; Hao Chen; Dejun Li; Yongxian Liu,Land use/land cover change affects total soil Se content and its bioavailability. Soil organic carbon was the overriding edaphic factor controlling soil Se status. Climate variables strongly influenced soil Se status at the regional scale. Soil Se retention increased after cropland abandonment mainly due to SOC accumulation.,"Introduction: Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element for human and animal health 
Beyond total soil Se content, Se uptake by plants, i.e. bioavailability, depends more on its speciation and binding to soil fractions 
The abundance and bioavailability of Se in soil can be modified by a wide range of factors, including plant, soil properties, and climate conditions 
Land use/land cover change, which is an important aspect of global change, is always accompanied by changes in plant communities and strongly influences soil properties, particularly SOM 
Since 1950s, the Chinese government has implemented a series of ecological restoration programs, such as the Grain to Green Project, to guarantee the sustainable development of economy and society. In this context, land use/land cover change, e.g. the conversion of cropland to grassland or forest, is a common phenomenon occurring especially in the karst region of southwest China  | Materials and methods:  | Study area: This study was conducted in a typical karst area in the northwest of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, southwest China, including Huanjiang county and adjacent Duan county (23¬∞40 0 N-25¬∞25 0 N, 107¬∞35 0 E-108¬∞30 0 E). Most of the soils across this region are developed on carbonate rocks. The study region belongs to subtropical monsoon climate, with mean annual air temperature (MAT) ranging from 17.8 to 22.2 ¬∞C and mean annual precipitation (MAP) ranging from 1346 to 1640 mm. | Field sampling: Field sampling was conducted from the end of March to early June 2015. The sampling sites were selected based on land use/land cover types, including active cropland, grassland, shrubland, and secondary forest (Fig. 
In total, 125 sites were selected, with 27 croplands, 29 grasslands, 36 shrublands, and 33 secondary forests therein. At each site, a 20 √Ç 20 m sampling plot was established and surface soil samples (0-15 cm) were collected with a stainless steel auger (5 cm in diameter). We sampled 10-15 soil cores randomly in each plot and then mixed it to form a composite sample. After transporting to the laboratory, the soils were air-dried at room temperature, disaggregated, and then passed through a 2 mm mesh sieve, with plant residues and stone fragments removed by hand-sorting. The 2 mm sieved soil samples were used to measure phosphate extractable Se, soil pH, size fractions, exchangeable Ca, Mg, Fe and Al. An aliquot of 2 mm sieved samples were further ground and passed through a 0.15 mm mesh sieve to measure total soil Se and soil organic carbon (SOC). | Chemical analyses: Total soil Se (Se total ) was analyzed according to the method as described in 
The prepared samples for determining Se total and Se phosphate were analyzed by hydride generation-atomic fluorescence spectrometry (HG-AFS830, Titan Instrument Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). Data for Se total and Se phosphate concentrations were finally presented as lg Se kg √Ä1 dry soil. The total Se concentration of the standard reference material was 651 ¬± 83 mg Se kg √Ä1 (the certified values of 640 ¬± 140 mg Se kg √Ä1 ).
Soil gravimetric water content (GWC) was determined by drying soil at 105 ¬∞C to constant weight. Soil pH was measured in a suspension of 1:2.5 soil:water ratio using a pH meter (FE20K, Mettler-Toledo, Switzerland). SOC was determined by wet oxidation with potassium dichromate redox colorimetric method. Soil total phosphorus (TP) was digested with an H 2 SO 4 + HClO 4 solution. Soil available phosphorus (AP) was extracted with 0.5 M NaHCO 3 . TP and AP were determined using the molybdenum colorimetric method. Size fractions, i.e. clay (<2 lm), silt (2-50 lm), and sand (50-2000 lm) were analyzed on a laser diffraction particle size analyzer after decarbonation (Mastersizer, 2000, Malvern, UK). Exchangeable calcium (Ca ex ) and magnesium (Mg ex ) were measured after extracting with 1 mol L √Ä1 ammonium acetate at pH 7.0 with inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Fe and Al oxides were extracted by ammonium oxalate solution (0.2 mol L √Ä1 , pH = 3), which can extract free amorphous oxides and hydrous oxides and Fe and Al-humus complexes, and were quantified by ICP-AES. | Statistical analyses: Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software package version 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All data were first checked for normality and homogeneity before variance analysis. One-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test was used to examine the differenes in Se total and Se phosphate among various land use/land cover types at P < 0.05 significance level. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to examine the relationships between environmental factors and Se total , Se phosphate , and the Se phosphate /Se total ratio. Stepwise multiple linear regression approach was used to identify the strongest explanatory variables for Se total , Se phosphate and the Se phosphate /Se total ratio. | Results:  | Total soil Se concentration (Se total ): Se total for all samples ranged from 220 to 1820 lg kg √Ä1 , with an arithmetic average value of 676 ¬± 24 (mean ¬± SE) lg kg √Ä1 . There was significant difference in Se total among land use/land cover types (P < 0.01, Fig.  | Phosphate extractable Se (Se phosphate ): Se phosphate for all samples ranged from 1 to 257 lg kg √Ä1 , with an arithmetic mean value of 79 ¬± 5 lg kg √Ä1 . Land use/land cover had significant influences on Se phosphate (P < 0.01, Fig.  | Dependence of Se on environmental variables: Se total was positively correlated with MAP, MAT, GWC, SOC, C:N ratio, TP, pH, Ca, Mg, Fe-Al oxides and sand contents, while was negatively correlated with AP. Similarly, Se phosphate was positively correlated with GWC, SOC, TP, pH, Ca and Mg contents, while was negatively correlated with AP. In addition, unlike Se total , Se phosphate did not correlate with Fe-Al oxides and sand contents, but negatively correlate with MAP, MAT, and clay content (Table 
Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis further demonstrated that SOC, MAP, and C:N ratio were the best three predictors for Se total , explaining 55% of Se total variation (Table  | Discussion:  | Soil Se abundance and bioavailability in the studied region: In the present study, Se total for all samples (220-1820 lg kg √Ä1 ) is within the reported range of topsoil Se concentration across China (5-79080 lg kg √Ä1 ) 
Se-deficient (<125 lg kg √Ä1 ), Se-marginal (125-175 lg kg √Ä1 ), Se-sufficient (175-400 lg kg √Ä1 ), Se-rich (400-3000 lg kg √Ä1 ), and Se-excessive (>3000 lg kg √Ä1 ). Moreover, the proportion of potentially bioavailable Se, i.e. Se phosphate , to total Se in the studied region is on average 12.9 ¬± 0.8%, which is higher than that reported for Enshi soils (<5%)  | Land use/land cover impact on soil Se abundance and bioavailability: In the current study, both soil Se total and Se phosphate showed a tendency to increase along the sequence of cropland, grassland, shrubland, and secondary forest (Fig. 
Several mechanisms might be responsible for the significant Se enrichment in topsoils of the secondary forest. First and foremost, significantly higher concentration of SOC accumulates in the secondary forest, relative to the other four land use/land cover types (Table 
Second, soils in the secondary forest are much wetter than those in the other three land use/land cover types (Table  | 2√Ä: ) which is hardly adsorbed on soil solid surface, and is not only readily available to plants but vulnerable to loss by leaching. However, when under the environment of moderate redox, as in the case of the secondary forest in our study, the prevailing form of inorganic Se would be selenite (SeO 3 | 2√Ä: ) which is firmly adsorbed on clay minerals and sesquioxides, and is not readily available to plants, thus largely retaining in the soil 
Third, the high humidity environment in the secondary forest enhances carbonate rock dissolution. In the present study, significant correlations were observed between Se total and some bedrock-derived elements such as P, Ca, and Mg (Table 
generally higher relative to the cropland and other land use/land cover types in the karst region of southwest China. | Factors influencing soil Se abundance and bioavailability: Parent bedrock has traditionally been considered the primary source of Se in soil. Furthermore, parent material can also exert great controls on Se biogeochemical cycling by influencing soil physicochemical properties, including pH, texture, ion composition (P, Ca, etc.), metal oxides, and SOM stock 
Atmospheric Se inputs via precipitation is another important source of soil Se, and in some cases it plays a dominant role, over parent bedrocks, in controlling the distribution of Se in topsoils 
Clay and Fe-Al oxides has been considered important edaphic variables contributing to Se retention in the soil, due to their relative high surface area and abundant binding sites  | Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that land use/land cover change had significant effects on the total concentration and potential bioavailability of Se in topsoils in a karst Se-enriched area in Guangxi, southwest China. Both Se total and Se phosphate were generally higher in the secondary forest than those in the cropland and grassland. SOC was the overriding edaphic variable controlling soil Se abundance and bioavailability. Furthermore, soil Se abundance and bioavailability could be strongly influenced by climatic variables such as MAP and MAT. In addition, high P status, coinciding with lower organic matter content, may be responsible for less Se retention in cropland. Our findings suggest that the abundance and potential bioavailability of Se in topsoil would substantially increase after cropland abandonment in the karst Se-enriched area of southwest China, mainly due to SOM accumulation. In the long run, there is a high risk of accelerated Se resource depletion in intensified agricultural systems, especially for those with high input of P fertilizers.","Hazardous concentrations of

It also aspires to be a guide, offering readers instructions as to how best to use the book. We therefore strongly encourage all readers to read this chapter carefully, so as to gain a clearer understanding of all the different aspects analysed in this book. This chapter also provides essential information for those wishing to do the practical exercises in this book.
We begin by presenting the aims of the book and we offer a few tips explaining how each group of users can make best use of this book according to their particular requirements. Then, we provide information about the software and the data required to carry out the practical exercises presented in Parts II and III (Sect. 5). In the last section, we offer a detailed explanation of the review of LUC datasets carried out in Chap. ""Land Use Cover Datasets: A Review"" and Part IV (Sect. 6).
The book is the fruit of two research projects which seek to provide a clearer understanding of the uncertainties associated with Land Use Cover maps and with the results of Land Use Cover Change modelling exercises (INCERTIMAPS Project: Suitability and uncertainty of land use and land cover maps for the analysis and modelling of territorial dynamics) and the promotion of Open Access software for teaching spatial science (PE117519: Herramientas para la Ense√±anza de la Geom√°tica con programas de C√≥digo Abierto). See complete information about these projects in the section Acknowledgements.
2 What is the Main Aim of This Book?
The aim of this book is to provide an up-to-date state of the art on Land Use Cover (LUC) datasets and validation tools. The book summarizes the available information and makes it accessible to any interested user, including some of the latest developments in the field.
The book was conceived as a practical tool to inform readers about currently available LUC datasets at global and supra-national scales and to help them understand more about the validation of LUC data and LUCC modelling exercises, so enabling them to validate their own data and models. To this end, the book combines brief theoretical explanations with practical information and exercises.
Part I of the book briefly covers the theoretical foundations of LUC mapping, LUCC modelling and the analysis and assessment of their associated uncertainties. Parts II and III were conceived as practical guides to enable any reader to use any of the tools and data. Part II covers the visualization of LUC data and the production of reference datasets to validate LUC maps. Part III describes the use of common validation tools and the interpretation of their results. All the practical exercises are accompanied by an explanation of the basic theory behind them, so as to enable users to understand the analyses and the principles on which the techniques are based. Finally, Part IV of the book characterizes the most relevant available LUC data. It also provides all the necessary information as to how to download and use the datasets.
As the book aims to reach the widest possible audience, the theory is briefly explained in simple, understandable terms. Practical exercises are implemented in QGIS, an open-source Geographical Information System, which can be downloaded for free.
3 Who is the Book Aimed At?
The book is aimed at anyone interested in Land Use Cover (LUC) mapping, Land Use Cover Change modelling and Land Use Cover Change analysis. Although to make full use of the book, some background in the field is recommended, it aims to be accessible and useful to all kinds of user, regardless of their level of expertise. Nonetheless, a basic knowledge of spatial analysis and GIS analysis is required to understand a lot of the information provided.
The book will be particularly useful for researchers working in the fields of LUC mapping and LUCC modelling and especially for those interested in validation methods and the available sources of LUC data. Those interested in the application of open-source software in LUC may also find this book very useful, as it is the only book working with open-source software that focuses on these topics from a holistic perspective. For the QGIS community, the book provides the relevant information and tools to enable users to take full advantage of the software and expand the fields in which it can be effectively applied.
4 How to Use This Book?
The book can be used in different ways, depending on the type of user and their particular background and interests. With this in mind, it has been conceived as a flexible tool that can be used for a wide variety of purposes.
Beginners in this field are referred to Chap. ""Land Use Cover Mapping, Modelling and Validation. A Background"", as are other users interested in gaining an overall picture of LUC mapping, LUCC modelling and the essential concepts required for uncertainty and validation analyses. This short, yet comprehensive chapter sets out the basic theoretical principles on which the rest of the book is based and is therefore recommended reading for all users.
For LUC data visualization and creation, readers are referred to Part II of this book. It provides an overview of the different options available for symbolizing LUC data and LUC change in GIS. It also addresses some of the problems associated with the spatial visualization of LUC information. This part of the book also includes a tutorial on the creation of a set of sample points for LUC data validation with QGIS.
Users interested in the validation of LUC datasets and Land Use Cover Change (LUCC) modelling exercises should refer to Chap. ""Validation of Land Use Cover Maps: A Guideline"". This provides guidelines for validating different LUC products: single LUC maps, LUC map series, and outputs from LUCC modelling exercises. The different tools and methods referred to in these guidelines are then described in detail and applied in practice in the example exercises in Part III of the book.
Users interested in doing the example QGIS exercises appearing in this book should refer to Sect. 5 of this chapter, which presents all the data and the cases studied in this book. It also offers essential information about the particular version of QGIS that we use and about how to integrate R software into QGIS, a necessary step when carrying out some of the exercises set out in the book.
Those interested in LUC data sources should refer to Chap. ""Land Use Cover Datasets: A Review"", which offers an introduction to LUC mapping at global and supra-national scales, including a review of the different datasets available. Part IV of the book offers in-depth descriptions of most of the datasets that are available for download, detailing their specific characteristics and how they can be accessed. The methodology followed in the review of the datasets is described in Sect. 6 of this chapter. | QGIS Plugins: QGIS works with plugins written in the C++ and Python programming languages. These plugins are an easy way to expand the capabilities of the software, which is why many of the features of the software are currently implemented through these plugins.
There are two types of plugins: core and external plugins (QGIS Project 2020). The core plugins are maintained by the QGIS Development Team and automatically form part of the distributed software. The external plugins are developed by a community of users and are available at the QGIS Python Plugins Repository (https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/).
The external plugins may be up-to-date or outdated and are usually available for specific QGIS versions. The official plugin repository includes information about all these questions. External plugins that are still in the early stages of development and have not been widely used are marked by QGIS as experimental plugins and are not directly available through the software.
Several QGIS plugins are used in the exercises presented in this book (Table 
The Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin is one of the most important QGIS plugins and is used in many of the exercises in this book. It was developed and updated by Luca 
LecoS (Landscape ecology Statistics) is a plugin developed by 
The R Processing Provider allows the R software capabilities to be integrated into QGIS. Full documentation on the plugin is available at the official website (see 
QuickMapServices is a very used QGIS plugin that allows to import to the QGIS interface many different web-map services of different kinds (XYZ tiles, TMS, WMS, WMTS, ESRI ArcGIS Services). More information on the plugin is available in the official website (see Table 
We also use MapAccurAssess, a plugin specifically developed for the exercises of this book by Dom√≠nguez Vera (2021). Although not available yet in the official QGIS plugin repository, it can be downloaded from the official repository of information accompanying this book (see Table 
To install any of these plugins in QGIS, access the ""Manage and install plugins‚Ä¶"" tool in the plugins menu to find the plugin you require. Once selected, click on the ""Install Plugin"" option (Fig.  | Integrating R into QGIS: Some of the exercises presented in this book use R, a free, open-source statistical software. QGIS enables the R environment to be integrated into the software, making it easier for any QGIS user to take full advantage of the tools available through R.
QGIS does not have the required tools to compute all the validation tools and methods that have been reviewed in this book. We have therefore had to implement some of them in QGIS through the R processing environment. Users wishing to find out more about R and its integration into QGIS, with practical exercises about how to use both software packages in combination, should consult the manual by 
To integrate R into QGIS, users must begin by downloading the R software. R and any of its associated data can be downloaded from a comprehensive file network, from which users must select the mirror closest to their location at https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html.
Once downloaded and installed, users must also install a series of packages in R to execute the different tools and methods included in the book (Table 
Table 
After installing R and the required packages, we need to install the QGIS plugin that allows us to integrate the two software packages. This is the ""Processing R provider"" plugin. Instructions to this end can be found in Sect. 5.2 of this chapter. After installing the plugin, users must download the scripts we have developed to integrate the R tools and capabilities into QGIS. These scripts are listed in Table  | Study Areas: The exercises provided in this book are applied to three specific study areas: the Ari√®ge Valley (France), the Asturias Central Area (Spain) and the Marqu√©s de Comillas municipality (Mexico). We now offer a brief introduction to these study areas, so as to give readers the contextual information they require for a clearer understanding of the results of the exercises. | The Asturias Central Area (Spain): The Asturias Central Area is a rural-industrial-urban area located in the heart of Asturias, in Northern Spain (Fig. 
The cities at the top of the urban hierarchy are Oviedo, Gij√≥n and Avil√©s, which concentrate most of the urban LUC dynamics in recent decades (Gobierno del Principado de Asturias 2016). The area within the triangle formed by the three cities has also been the subject of important LUC dynamics, with the emergence of new industrial and residential developments, attracted by the accessibility that the area's extensive transport network provides  | Ari√®ge Valley (France): The Ari√®ge Valley area consists of the central part of the valley formed by the River Ari√®ge, which is situated is in the department of the same name about 70 km south of Toulouse (Fig. 
In the past, the Ari√®ge Valley was a centre for industrial and mining activities while today it is mainly rural. Tourism is increasingly common. The most notable LUC dynamics are reforestation and the increase in built-up areas, which are mainly concentrated along the river. | Marqu√©s de Comillas (Mexico): Marques de Comillas is a physiographical region of the Lacandon rainforest in Chiapas, Mexico (Fig. 
A colonization programme by the Mexican Government in the 1970s encouraged the establishment of farming communities in forest-covered areas, promoting agriculture, agroforestry (cacao) and cattle ranching, which is currently the most important business activity. Over the last 40 years, Marqu√©s de Comillas has suffered a dramatic loss in forest cover; in the mid-1980s, forests occupied 83% of the region, while today, this has fallen to just 29%, less than half of which are well-preserved forests. The landscapes are now made up above all of mosaics of agricultural lands, cattle pastures and human settlements. information about this dataset can be found in Chap. "" General Land Use Cover datasets for Europe"" of this book.
A simpler version of CLC is used in the Ari√®ge Valley (Fig. 
Some of the maps in the Asturias Central Area case study were obtained after simplification of the SIOSE database. The maps were obtained after the classification of each SIOSE polygon into a single category and after the rasterization at 50 m of the original vector dataset (Fig. 
The Marques de Comillas LUC map (Fig. 
In the following tables, we list the files from the different datasets and LUC modelling exercises described above that have been used in different exercises in this book. More datasets are available online, including extra LUC maps and model drivers not considered in the exercises in this book.
The tables include information about the name of the file available for download and the descriptive name used to refer to these files in the book. For each dataset, we also provide the projection of the dataset and the file describing the legend of the maps. A document listing all these characteristics for the layers only available online is also provided when downloading the data.  Chapter ""Land Use Cover Datasets: A Review"" and Part IV of the book contain a review of the Land Use Cover datasets available at global and supra-national scales. Due to the limited extent and scope of this book, we did not review national and regional LUC datasets, which are far too numerous for our purposes.
The datasets we reviewed are classified into two groups, depending on the information they provide. The first group is made up of the datasets that provide information about the different land uses or covers without focusing on any one of them in particular, i.e. general LUC datasets. The second group consists of the LUC datasets that map a specific land use or cover in detail (e.g. vegetation, croplands, built-up areas‚Ä¶). These are referred to as thematic LUC datasets. Some datasets are difficult to assign to one of the two groups, as they map a wide range of LUC categories while also providing specific detail on just one of them. The authors decided which group to assign them to on a case-by-case basis.
The datasets were also classified according to their extent, differentiating between global and supra-national LUC datasets. The first group of datasets maps land uses or covers all over the Earth, while the second maps them for a specific area covering more than one country. The maps in the second group may cover a whole continent or focus on just a few countries.
When making the review, we consulted the most relevant web portals and repositories of LUC data (Table 
Very old or outdated maps, which were produced according to traditional cartographic methods, are not included in this review. Nor are other old maps that combine LUC information with other data about climate or biogeographic variables, such as the maps produced by 
There are plenty of other spatial datasets that provide important information for studying specific land covers. For vegetation covers, maps of live biomass are a good example 
Part IV of the book characterizes in detail all the reviewed LUC datasets that are currently available for download and may be relevant for a wide community of users. Datasets produced at very coarse scales or which are already very outdated are not described in Part IV, as they are of limited utility for most members of the LUC community. LUC datasets currently unavailable for download are not characterized in Part IV either. We tried to obtain, either online or by contacting the authors, all the global or supra-national datasets to which we found references. Some of them, however, are no longer available. These datasets have not been reviewed.
The LUC datasets described in Part IV were characterized according to the following elements: information about the project or context within which they were produced; information about their method of production; description of the data available for download; and practical information for using the dataset in an effective way. For each dataset we also provide all the technical references in which it is described as well as other references of interest in which it is used or analysed. A table summarizing the main characteristics of the dataset (extent, temporal availability, spatial resolution, updates, accuracy‚Ä¶) is also provided. | Introduction: Land Use and Land Cover (LUC) data is an important source of information for a wide range of users from different backgrounds and scientific disciplines. It provides an overview of the different covers on the Earth's surface (e.g. vegetation, agricultural fields, rocks, water, artificial sur-faces‚Ä¶) and how they evolve over time. It also traces how these covers are used (land use) and how this use changes.
LUC data can be very useful in an array of different fields. It is especially valuable for understanding the impact that many natural and human-induced processes, such as climate change, deforestation and urbanization, can have on the Earth's surface. As a result, LUC research has been receiving increasing attention over recent decades, and the number of fields making use of this data is on the rise.
Researchers have been proposing new methods and techniques for producing LUC maps. This has increased the number of LUC datasets available at global, continental, regional and local scales. This has also led to an increase in the number of users who decide to make their own LUC maps. The validation of LUC data has also been the subject of specific research and new methods, strategies and techniques have been proposed for validating and analysing LUC maps.
Despite all these advances, many users are still unaware of the wide range of datasets available, while others lack a clear understanding of the methods or techniques that can be used to validate LUC data. Thus, in addition to producing more LUC datasets, more information is required. Users must be able to find out more about the most appropriate datasets for their field of study, and the general uncertainties and limitations of each one. They should also be informed about the methods that can be used to assess the specific utility and uncertainties of this data for their line of research. | Land Use versus Land Cover: Although Land Use and Land Cover are often combined, for example, in references to LUC maps and information, they in fact have quite separate meanings. Many authors have proposed complementary definitions (Di Gregorio and Jansen 1998;  | Directive INSPIRE (2007/2/EC): Land Cover: Physical and biological cover of the earth's surface including artificial surfaces, agricultural areas, forests, (semi-)natural areas, wetlands, water bodies.
Land Use: Territory characterised according to its current and future planned functional dimension or socio-economic purpose 
Land cover refers to the Earth's biophysical covers. Areas without a specific cover, such as areas of bare rock or bare soil, are also regarded as land covers. By contrast, land use refers to the activities that humans carry out on the Earth's surface or on a specific land cover.
A land cover can have one or multiple uses, or even none. An artificial surface could be used to host people (e.g. residential area), production (e.g. industrial area) or leisure activities (e.g. sports facilities). In maps at coarser scales, this artificial surface can host all these uses together. For example, an urban area is an artificial cover which has multiple uses. Bare rock, on the other hand, often hosts no land use of any kind.
A specific land use can also be associated with multiple land covers at the same time. An airport is a land use that is usually associated with several artificial covers, such as buildings, roads and runways, and also with vegetation covers, like grassland.
Whereas land covers are usually visible in aerial or satellite images, land uses are more difficult to distinguish. For instance, a building could have multiple uses: apartments, offices, industrial plants, sports facilities, etc. Sometimes the land use can be deduced from contextual information in the image, but, in most cases, additional information is required. This makes map production more difficult and expensive. As a result, most maps only provide information about land covers. In other cases, they focus on the land use of certain specific covers, such as artificial or agricultural areas, so providing both Land Use and Land Cover (LUC) data. This is why in LUC science, we generally talk about Land Use and Land Cover information, as the two aspects tend to be combined within the same datasets.
3 Land Use and Land Cover Mapping:
A History Some information on Land Use and Land Cover was available prior to the advent of remote sensing instruments 
Before the emergence of aeroplanes and satellites, the main method for map production was ground survey 
With the advent of aerial imagery and, later, satellite imagery, mappers obtained a view of the Earth's surface from the top of the atmosphere or from space. Mapping became easier and cheaper 
Information collected in the field was still required to validate what was photointerpreted and to include some extra information that was not discernible in the image 
Aerial images became increasingly common from the beginning of the twentieth century, with the development of the aeroplane industry within the context of the two World Wars 
The launch of the first satellite into space in 1957 proved a turning point in the history of LUC mapping 
Satellites record the reflectance of the Earth's surface in different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The reflectance curve for each land cover can be independently characterized and defined (Chuvieco 2016; 
Despite these limitations, the availability of satellite imagery and the ease with which land cover information could be obtained from them boosted the production of land cover maps, which until then had been relatively rare 
Manual photointerpretation was still common in the early years of satellite remote sensing 
As LUC mapping became easier, cheaper and quicker, many institutions, scientists and other users began producing LUC datasets at all the different scales 
The AVHRR sensor on board the NOAA weather satellites launched in 1978 
Since then, LUC mapping practice has been developed in parallel with the launch of new satellites and the increasing improvement in their spatial and spectral resolutions 
The key role played by the USGS is undeniable. It authored the first research laying down the foundations of modern LUC mapping 
Users now have more information available than ever  | Uses of LUC Data: The importance and utility of Land Use and Land Cover information is beyond doubt. LUC data is a valuable source of information for scientists 
Policymakers also need LUC data for proper resource management and to help them deal with many of the challenges facing society today 
Local administrations need land use information for spatial planning. Regional and national governments may require LUC information for water management, flood control or in the design and assessment of environmental policies. At the international level, LUC data provides important evidence on which to base decisions regarding many of the global challenges facing society today.
Most of the current global agendas refer to policy objectives involving Land Use and Land Cover. They play a direct role in 7 out of 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Convention on Biological Diversity, the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands 
The Group on Earth Observations (GEO) has defined eight Social Benefit Areas (SBAs) in which Earth observations, including LUC data, provide useful evidence in support of policymaking. 
Among scientists, LUC maps are frequently used as a basis for modelling exercises 
LUC information is also used for many other research activities, most of them related to the different policy fields mentioned above. In recent years, it has been applied, for example, in studies analysing habitat distribution and ecosystem services  | Land Change Science: Although LUC information is employed for manifold purposes, the field taking most advantage of this data is Land Use and Land Cover Change (LUCC) analysis 
LUC change analyses are widely used in climate change studies 
The importance of LUCC studies has led to the emergence of a specialist field called Land Change Science 
Land Change scientists are responsible for monitoring LUC change, understanding it and modelling for the future, so obtaining knowledge and evidence that may be useful for policymaking 
Many international programmes and organizations have stressed the importance of LUCC and Land Change Science  | Land Use and Land Cover Change Modelling: As previously noted, Land Change Science is not only a question of analysing and understanding LUC changes, but it also seeks to model them in the near future 
Models allow us to play around with the system we are studying so as to predict how different policies affect LUC and the changes they may cause 
LUC maps are the main input for LUCC models 
Many types of LUCC models are available today 
Process-based models simulate the processes taking place, rather than the pattern (O'Sullivan and Perry 2013). There are different kinds of process-based models, with agent-based LUCC models gaining increasing popularity. These models simulate the behaviour of the agents or actors that take part in the system being modelled and their interactions (Crooks and Heppenstall 2012). These agents cause the processes taking place on the ground and the changes in the landscape pattern. Although important, LUC maps do not play the same key role in these models as they do in pattern-based models, as most of the parameters used in process-based models are inferred from other sources 
LUCC models can also be classified according to the scale of analysis, their stochastic or deterministic nature, the type of scenarios they can produce and the techniques and methods they apply (Garc√≠a-√Ålvarez 2018a). For example, some models include Markov chains to estimate the quantity of simulated change in the future 
Modelling exercises normally consist of four main phases: calibration, simulation, validation and the proposal of scenarios 
Calibration refers to the setting-up and parametrization of the model 
The methods and techniques used for calibration are similar to, if not the same as, those used in the validation phase  | Uncertainty and Validation: The increased availability of satellite and aerial imagery and the development of new methods and techniques for image processing and classification has enabled the production of an increasing number of LUC maps and time series of LUC maps at all scales 
With the increasing production and use of LUC maps and LUCC models, more attention has been paid to the uncertainty and limitations of these data and analyses 
It is important to realize that all spatial data and analyses contain some degree of uncertainty 
In the case of LUC maps, the complexity and variety of real landscapes is normally translated into a given set of categories (Di 
Mapping the full complexity of the Earth remains beyond human capacity, and even beyond existing computer capabilities 
To understand the uncertainty and limitations of our data and analyses, we usually carry out uncertainty assessments 
Although validation is already a common practice and there are many methods, strategies and reference data available for validating LUC maps and LUCC models, there is still a lot of room for improvement. In the case of LUCC maps, when 
In LUCCM, several authors emphasized the importance of analysing the uncertainty of the results, even when general validation exercises are carried out 
The uncertainty of most of the available LUC datasets has been assessed in a large range of research studies 
Many users develop their own maps, given the increasing availability of free imagery and tools with which to process and classify the images easily  | Conclusions: Many frequent users of LUC data and LUCC models are unaware of the latest developments in validation and uncertainty analysis of LUC data. It is also possible that they have limited knowledge of many of the datasets currently available for carrying out LUC exercises.
Many of the recent advances in this field remain within closed scientific communities and are not disseminated among the wider LUC community outside the research arena. This book seeks to respond to their needs. It provides an overview of the state of the art on LUC datasets, including time series of LUC maps, and the tools and methods available for LUC map validation. It also presents and explains frequently used tools and guidelines for validating the results produced by LUCC models. As many of the tools and techniques reviewed here are used in both LUC mapping and LUCC modelling validation exercises, in this book we address these two analyses together.
A full validation exercise, characterizing all the uncertainties of a given dataset or model, is a complex task that requires a high level of expertise and a wide range of tools and strategies, each one addressing different sources of uncertainty. This is beyond the scope of this book. Here we focus on the quantitative validation of LUC maps and LUCC model results. For detailed information about qualitative analyses of uncertainty, we refer readers to more specialized bibliography, depending on the specific objectives of their research. Readers wishing to find out more about other important aspects of uncertainty and validation practice, such as uncertainty communication, are also referred to specific literature on this topic. | Further Reading: Giri C (ed) (2012) Remote sensing of land use and land cover.

Camacho Olmedo MT, Paegelow M, Mas J-F, Escobar F (2018) Geomatic Approaches for Modeling Land Change Scenarios.  | Garc√≠a: Land Use Cover Mapping, Modelling and Validation. A Background | Introduction: Validation is a required step prior to the effective use of any Land Use Cover (LUC) dataset or of the results of a Land Use Cover Change Modelling (LUCCM) exercise. We need to understand to what extent these datasets and results are uncertain in order to be able to assess the limits that these uncertainties may impose on the conclusions of our analyses and studies.
There are many methods, tools and strategies currently available for validating LUC data and LUCCM exercises. However, comprehensive guidelines providing users with clear instructions and recommendations about how to carry out this validation are scarce. 
In this chapter, we aim to provide readers with a general overview of the available tools and strategies for validating LUC data-specifically LUC maps-and LUCCM exercises. We give readers different guidelines according to the type of maps they want to validate: single LUC maps (Sect. 3), time series of LUC maps (Sect. 4) and results of LUCCM exercises (Sect. 5). Although some of the available methods and tools can be applied to all these maps, each type of validation exercise has its own specific aspects that users must bear in mind. For example, the results of LUCCM exercises include soft and hard LUC maps. The hard outputs of a model-hard maps-are very similar to input LUC maps, while the soft outputs-soft maps-are continuous and ranked. We therefore also present some validation methods that focus specifically on soft maps.
Before presenting these validation methods and functions, it is important to make clear that visual inspection is an essential part of any validation exercise. It can provide a great deal of information about the uncertainties of the data being evaluated, which are not detected by the quantitative methods reviewed in this book. Visual inspection should be conducted during all validation exercises, at the beginning, at the end and throughout the entire process. The exercises presented in Part III have been applied using the Quantum GIS (QGIS) software and R scripts. To homogenize the exercises across the different chapters, they have the same standard objectives: to validate a map (t 1 ) against reference data/map (t 1 ) (single LUC map); to validate a series of maps with two or more time points (t 0 , t 1, t 2 ‚Ä¶) (LUC maps series/ LUC changes); and, for results from LUCCM exercise, to validate soft maps produced by the model against a reference map of changes (t 0t 1 ) (soft LUC maps), to validate a simulation (T 1 ) against a reference map (t 1 ) (single LUC map -hard LUC maps) and to validate simulated changes (t 0 -T 1 ) against a reference map of changes (t 0t 1 ) (LUC maps series / LUC changeshard LUC maps). However, in certain specific cases, additions have been made to these standard titles. In addition to the applications of each method/function implemented in the practical exercises in this book, the cells shaded in grey in Fig.  | Validation of Single Land Use Cover Maps: The validation of single LUC maps is the most widespread practice of all those addressed in this book. 
Users have been validating their maps since the advent of digital remote sensing and the first classifications of digital imagery, as a means of assessing to what extent the classified images resemble the real LUC on the ground. Now, several decades later, the validation of single LUC maps is a very common practice, and although new methods and tools have been developed over the years, the original ones remain popular. These are based above all on the comparison of the assessed LUC map with reference datasets through cross-tabulation 
The reference datasets for validating single LUC maps may be obtained from different sources of LUC data. These can be classified into two main groups: ground samples and reference LUC maps. However, in the validation exercises, other reference spatial data can also be used, such as the raw imagery used in the classification process or the soft maps obtained as a result.
The ground samples collected through field surveys provide highly accurate, detailed data. However, this information is very expensive to obtain and fieldwork is not an option when working with large study areas. This is why most reference LUC samples are obtained by photointerpretation or classification of satellite imagery. The data obtained via photointerpretation must be of higher quality that the data being validated. This usually involves careful interpretation of a set of samples using imagery with a higher spatial resolution than the images used to create the map. Another option is photointerpretation of the same imagery used to obtain the dataset, applying a different workflow and methods or techniques that guarantee better quality.
Those using these methods to obtain LUC samples for validation purposes should provide information about their accuracy or uncertainty. When obtaining reference data by field surveys or photointerpretation, users must take particular care when selecting the sampling strategy they will apply during the collection of this information, as it can have an important impact on the results of the validation exercise and on their validity (see chapter ""Visualization and Communication of LUC Data"").
LUC maps can also be validated against other LUC maps. In these cases, the reference LUC map must have a higher spatial resolution and greater detail that the map being assessed. They must also be of proven quality, i.e. maps or datasets with verified accuracy and uncertainty. Although less precise, validation exercises carried out by comparing the evaluated map with other LUC maps are quick and very cheap, hence their popularity. This also allows a wider set of methods and techniques to be used compared to the possibilities offered by reference datasets other than maps.
Users can also validate their LUC maps against additional sources of information other than reference datasets, in order to characterize the maps in more detail and gain a clearer picture of their uncertainty. Such sources include raw imagery, which is often used in the classification process, or the soft maps obtained from it, which are used to assess the characteristics of the pixels that make up each class. Raw imagery can be used to evaluate the reflectance value for all the pixels belonging to a particular class and how close it is to the reference reflectance value used in the classification process. When available, users can also compare each category pixel with soft maps showing the percentage of each pixel belonging to each of the LUC categories under consideration. Similar insights into the accuracy of LUC maps can be obtained by comparing them with continuous LUC If we focus on validation tools (Fig. 
In some cases, the level of agreement may vary at different levels of spatial detail. For example, when spatially aggregated and simplified, the LUC map being evaluated may show more agreement with the reference dataset. The choice of spatial resolution is therefore a source of uncertainty. To account for this uncertainty, we can cross-tabulate the assessed and reference datasets at multiple spatial resolutions (see Sect. 2 in chapter ""Basic and Multiple-Resolution Cross Tabulation to Validate Land Use Cover Maps""), i.e. the original resolution and other coarser ones.
Different metrics are calculated from the confusion matrix (see chapters ""Metrics Based on a Cross-Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"" and ""Pontius Jr. Methods Based on a Cross-Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps""). These metrics summarize the agreement between reference and validated datasets in a single value and are therefore very easy to interpret. As a result, they have been widely used in LUC validation.
The most common metrics are the accuracy assessment statistics (see Sect. 5 in chapter ""Metrics Based on a Cross-Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") and the Kappa Indices (see Sect. 3 in chapter ""Metrics Based on a Cross-Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps""). The accuracy assessment statistics are standard metrics that provide information about the similarity between two georeferenced data. They are obtained from the cross-tabulation matrix and enable the extraction of specific information contained in the matrix. They include, among others, the overall, producer's and user's accuracy metrics. They are usually supplied with the cross-tabulation matrix, providing extra information in addition to that provided by the matrix itself (e.g. category area adjusted by the error level, confidence intervals‚Ä¶).
Of all these metrics, the most commonly used in validation exercises is probably Overall accuracy. There has been great debate in the literature about the threshold above which the Overall accuracy of a map can be considered acceptable. The 85% threshold proposed by 
The overall accuracy metric does not provide information about the accuracy at which each category on the LUC map is mapped. Important differences are often identified in terms of the relative accuracy of the different categories. Mixed LUC categories do not usually show the same accuracy as spectrally pure categories. At high levels of thematic detail, very similar LUC categories can be easily confused and will, therefore, have lower levels of accuracy. Users must take these differences at the category level into account and report the accuracy values for each category. The general approach for agreement between maps at global and stratum level may be useful to this end (see Sect. 4 in chapter ""Metrics Based on a Cross-Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps""). Some authors talk specifically about Overall and Individual Spatial Agreement, proposing different metrics for these purposes 
It is also important to remember that the accuracy of a LUC map is not usually the same across the entire mapped area and considerable spatial variations are possible. The bigger the area being mapped, the more likely it is for there to be spatial differences in accuracy levels across the mapped area. The cross-tabulation matrix does not provide information about these spatial differences. When mapping large study areas made up of different, clearly distinguishable regions, each region can be validated independently, producing a specific cross-tabulation matrix in each case. The global analysis would cover the entire map, while specific areas of the map (e.g. a region, a municipality‚Ä¶) could also be analysed at the stratum level.
Overall Accuracy is highly correlated with the Kappa Index 
The methods mentioned above do not employ fuzzy logic and, instead, apply a binary logic when calculating agreement, i.e. the two elements agree or don't agree. Partial agreements are not considered. However, there are some tools for calculating map agreement that incorporate fuzzy logic, such as the Fuzzy Kappa or the Fuzzy Kappa Simulation 
Other metrics, similar to Kappa, have also been proposed. Usually they aim to outperform Kappa and correct some of its associated problems. These include, among others, the F-Score (P√©rez-Hoyos et al. 2020), Scott's pi statistic 
Extensive research by 
Users can also specifically assess the pattern of the map they want to validate to find out how much its pattern coincides with that of the reference map. Pattern agreement can be assessed using Spatial metrics (see Sect. 1 in chapter ""Spatial Metrics to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") and the Map Curves method (see Sect. 1 in chapter ""Advanced Pattern Analysis to Validate Land Use Cover Maps""). Spatial metrics allow us to characterize different aspects of the map's pattern in detail, such as its fragmentation, the proportion allocated to each category, the complexity of the patches‚Ä¶ 
Geographic weighting methods (GWR) (see chapter ""Geographically Weighted Methods to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") can also be used to study the spatial distribution of LUC accuracy measures. The overall, user's and producer's accuracy metrics mentioned above are derived from the cross-tabulation matrix and are therefore not spatial metrics, i.e. they provide overall information for the entire area, without assessing the spatial distribution of error and accuracy. The application of Overall, user's and producer's accuracy metrics through GWR (see Sect. 1 in chapter ""Geographically Weighted Methods to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") can help the user to assess the suitability of the LUC data and to observe local variations in accuracy and error on the map  | Validation of Land Use Cover Maps Series/Land Use Cover Changes: There is no common practice or set of methods for validating or evaluating the uncertainty of a LUC map series with two or more time points (t 0 , t 1, t 2 ‚Ä¶). Most of the exercises for the validation of LUC data only refer to single LUC maps, without focusing specifically on the LUC change studied through a series of LUC maps. One of the facets that users most demand from LUC data is the ability to study and display LUC changes over time. We therefore need methods and tools to assess the uncertainty of the changes that are measured from LUC maps. It is worth noting that the individual accuracy of two LUC maps involved in a post-classification comparison offers few clues as to the accuracy of change, because the relation between the errors in the two maps is unknown. As pointed out by 
One of the main limitations when it comes to validating LUC changes and LUC map series is the lack of reference data. We could obtain reference datasets via photointerpretation or field surveys. However, it is difficult to guess where the LUC changes will take place, as they may happen at different places and with different intensities and patterns over space and time. In addition, there is a clear lack of LUC map series showing accurate, validated LUC change that could be used as reference data. Another option would be to validate the LUC changes against other types of reference data. This could be done for example by comparing the LUC changes measured over a time series of LUC maps against the difference in reflectance between two satellite images for the same time period. This is because when LUC change takes place, there is a significant change in the reflectance value registered by the satellite capturing the images.
Nevertheless, as commented earlier, the most common situation is that there are no reference datasets available. In these cases, the uncertainty of the LUC map series must be assessed by evaluating the consistency and the logic of the measured LUC change. The tools and techniques recommended here provide a great deal of information to the user. However, the final interpretation of the measured LUC change will be subjective, based on the user's expertise and understanding of the study area. In this situation, visual inspection can be very useful for quickly understanding many of the uncertainties in the time series of LUC maps that cannot be measured using quantitative metrics. This is why we recommend visual inspection as a first essential step prior to the validation of any LUC map or LUC modelling exercise.
Users must be aware that LUC change usually represents a very small portion of the mapped area. For a specific, not very large landscape, we would only expect a few features to change over a short period of time. In addition, the same area would not normally be expected to be affected by various successive changes. On the contrary, when an area changes, the new land use or cover tends to remain unchanged over time. In addition, there are some LUC transitions that make less sense than others. For example, one would not expect an artificial area to change to vegetation or agricultural land. These general assumptions may be adapted in line with the particular characteristics of the study area and also within the context of each element being analysed.
The same validation techniques reviewed above for single LUC maps (Sect. 3) can also be applied when comparing measured and reference changes or just for evaluating the consistency and logic of measured LUC change. However, some tools are specific to time series (Fig. 
The cross-tabulation matrix (see Sect. 1 in chapter ""Basic and Multiple-Resolution Cross Tabulation to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") is the tool that provides most information about the change happening between two LUC maps. For a time series, we can compare each pair of LUC maps to find out the changes that take place at each date and the area they cover, for the map as a whole and at category level. We can summarize the main processes of change in our study area, such as, for example, the artificialization or deforestation rates for each time period. This gives us an overview of the change that has taken place over our map series and makes it easier to interpret some of the inconsistencies in measured change. Some authors also propose making a summary of all the transitions taking place, associating some of them with a default degree of uncertainty 
Multi-resolution cross-tabulation (see Sect. 2 in chapter ""Basic and Multiple-Resolution Cross Tabulation to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") offers a means of checking whether some of the errors, inconsistencies or uncertainties we detect at the original resolution are not detected at coarser resolutions. When this happens, the errors and inconsistencies probably arise due to the level of detail at which the dataset was created.
The cross-tabulation matrix is an excellent source of information, which we can easily summarize using other tools and metrics. As commented in Sect. 3, Areal and spatial agreement metrics (see Sect. 2 in chapter ""Metrics Based on a Cross-Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") and Kappa Indices (see Sect. 3 in chapter ""Metrics Based on a Cross-Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") are used to assess the agreement between two maps. Despite their limitations, these metrics can be used to chart, in a generic way, the persistence or changes between two dates. If two maps in a series undergo the normal rate of change that we associate with any landscape, the differences between them should be slight, which means that the Kappa and agreement metrics should reflect high levels of coincidence between the maps being compared.
The Agreement between maps at global and stratum level (see Sect. 4 in chapter ""Metrics Based on a Cross-Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") analysis could provide additional specific information about the agreement in a time series of LUC maps at whole map level, or for a given stratum, i.e. a smaller area or a specific LUC category. Accuracy assessment statistics can also be calculated for a LUC map series, either globally (see Sect. 5 in chapter ""Metrics Based on a Cross-Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") or locally (Sect. 1 in chapter ""Geographically Weighted Methods to Validate Land Use Cover Maps""). For example, when the LUC map series is obtained using a base map that is progressively updated, the first stage is to validate the base map of the series using the same procedure described earlier for validating single LUC maps. Once this has been done, we can validate the changes against a reference dataset of changes through cross-tabulation, obtaining from the resulting table the overall, producer's and user's accuracy metrics. 
Change statistics (see Sect. 1 in chapter ""Metrics Based on a Cross-Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") 
Robert Gilmore Pontius Jr. has made major contributions to the family of validation techniques based on the cross-tabulation matrix (chapter ""Pontius Jr. Methods Based on a Cross-Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps""). The LUCC budget (see Sect. 2 in chapter ""Pontius Jr. Methods Based on a Cross-Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") 
Quantity and allocation disagreement (see Sect. 3 in chapter ""Pontius Jr. Methods Based on a Cross-Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") show, at overall and category level, differences between pairs of maps in terms of category proportions due to the different allocation of the categories. Few changes are expected in a time series of maps. This means that quantity and allocation disagreement should be low and should centre on the most dynamic categories.
The number of incidents and states (see Sect. 5 in chapter ""Pontius Jr. Methods Based on a Cross-Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") 
Spatial metrics (see Sect. 1 in chapter """") and Map curves (see Sect. 1 in chapter ""Advanced Pattern Analysis to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") enable us to characterize the pattern of each LUC map in the series. We do not expect the pattern of the map to vary significantly over the time period being analysed. This means that only smooth changes should be observed when comparing the spatial metrics for each of the periods analysed.
Spatial metrics that specifically measure the areas that change between pairs of maps may also be useful. In the case of a pair of maps or a time series, the detection of change on pattern borders (see Sect. 2 in chapter ""Advanced Pattern Analysis to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"")  | Validation of Land Use Cover Change Modelling Exercises: Validating a LUCC modelling exercise is a complex task. In this case, we are not validating a single LUC map or a series of LUC maps, but a model application made up of multiple inputs, which interact to deliver new results. When validating LUCC modelling exercises, users tend to focus exclusively on the validation of the model's hard maps, i.e. maps with a categorical legend similar to the input LUC maps 
Given the nature of this book, we will be dealing exclusively with the validation of LUC maps associated with LUCC modelling exercises: input LUC maps, output soft LUC maps and output hard LUC maps. Users must bear in mind that other sources of data can be used in LUCC modelling exercises and can be validated via complementary methods.
Modellers can begin a modelling exercise by evaluating the uncertainty of the input LUC maps used in the model and their changes according to the guidelines set out in Sects. 3 and 4 above. This is because the quality of the input LUC maps can have a significant effect on the performance of the model. When setting up LUCC models, it is essential to understand the changes that take place in the set of input and reference maps. An assessment of the uncertainty of these LUC changes is therefore vital for determining and characterizing the uncertainty of the LUCC modelling exercise.
In the following subsections, we present the validation tools for output LUC maps, i.e. the products obtained by the model, differentiating between soft and hard LUC maps. | Soft LUC Maps: Soft LUC maps, also referred to as suitability, change potential or change probability maps, are produced by the model to express the propensity to change over space, that is, the potential of each pixel to become a specific category in the future 
Soft LUC maps are usually validated against a reference map of changes (t 0t 1 ), and there are various methods for carrying out this analysis (see chapter ""Validation of Soft Maps Produced by a Land Use Cover Change Model""). The Pearson and Spearman correlation (see Sect. 1 in chapter ""Validation of Soft Maps Produced by a Land Use Cover Change Model"") is appropriate for a quick assessment of the soft map, by computing it against the map of observed change 
In short, the previous three methods evaluate the relationship between the observed changed area and the soft LUC map, assuming that a good model output allocates the highest change probability values to the areas that did actually change, and the lowest change probability values to the areas that did not change. Unlike the previous methods, the total uncertainty, quantity uncertainty and allocation uncertainty indices (see Sect. 4 in chapter ""Validation of Soft Maps Produced by a Land Use Cover Change Model"") 
In addition to these specific indices for soft LUC maps, validation can also be conducted after reclassifying the original soft maps, so transforming continuous, ranked maps (soft) into categorical maps (hard) (see Sects. 1 and 2 in chapter ""Basic and Multiple-Resolution Cross Tabulation to Validate Land Use Cover Maps""). This preliminary step enables most of the validation tools presented in this chapter to be applied for this purpose. | Hard LUC Maps: The second output obtained by the model is the hard LUC map. Also known as prospective LUC maps, these are simulated LUC maps with an identical categorical legend to the input LUC maps  | Single LUC Maps: The simulation (T 1 ) can only be validated against a single LUC map (t 1 ) if both maps correspond to the same year. This will also enable users to apply the panoply of tools presented in Sect. 3. The Accuracy assessment statistics, computed either globally (see Sect. 5 in chapter ""Metrics Based on a Cross-Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") or locally (see Sect. 1 in chapter ""Geographically Weighted Methods to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") could also be applied to validate the simulation against other LUC data such as ground points.
In addition to this generic list of tools, some metrics are specifically used for validating the hard LUC maps obtained from LUCCM exercises. Allocation distance error (see Sect. 3 in chapter ""Advanced Pattern Analysis to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"")  | LUC Maps Series/LUC Changes: The most appropriate, most complete validation procedure for hard maps must include three different maps: the simulation (T 1 ), a reference LUC map for the same year (t 1 ) and the base map over which the simulation is executed (t 0 ). In other words, if our modelling exercise starts in the year 2010, we will need a base map for 2010 to establish the initial landscape on which the simulation will be calculated. Then, if we run a simulation for the year 2020, we will also need a reference map for 2020 in order to be able to compare how well our model simulates change. By comparing the simulation and the reference map we can understand to what extent the simulation matches the reference data. The changes that take place on the reference map and the simulation can be extracted by comparing them with the base map. The changes extracted from the two maps can then be compared so as to find out how well the simulated changes agree with the changes that took place on the reference maps.
There are many tools for validating and understanding the errors and uncertainties of simulated changes. In fact, all the methods and strategies explained in Sect. 4 can be applied in LUCC modelling. In this case, however, the main purpose is to achieve the best possible fit between the results of the model and the reference data.
The majority of metrics are obtained from the cross-tabulation matrix (see Sect. 1 in chapter ""Basic and Multiple-Resolution Cross Tabulation to Validate Land Use Cover Maps""). The cross-tabulation matrix offers a detailed picture of the changes that were simulated (by cross-tabulating the simulation with the base map), the changes we used as a reference (by cross-tabulating the reference map with the base map) and the agreement and disagreement between the simulation and the reference map (by cross-tabulating the simulation with the reference map). The cross-tabulation matrix can also be used to summarize simulated and reference change in a series covering the main processes of change 
Cross tabulation can be carried out at multiple resolutions (see Sect. 2 in chapter ""Basic and Multiple-Resolution Cross Tabulation to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") (the original and coarser ones), to find out at which resolution there is the greatest agreement. Sometimes, the simulation and the reference landscape do not agree on the details but show high consistency at coarser scales. This implies that the model is unable to simulate the precise location of the changes, but it does simulate the main patterns of change correctly.
Different metrics have been proposed for summarizing the agreement between the simulation and the reference maps that the cross-tabulation matrix shows in raw (see chapter ""Metrics Based on a Cross-Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps""). The Areal and spatial agreement metrics (see Sect. 2 in chapter ""Metrics Based on a Cross-Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") could be applied to summarize the agreement between two maps of changes, the simulated and the reference change maps, overall or per category. Kappa (see Sect. 3 in chapter ""Metrics Based on a Cross-Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") also summarizes the overall agreement between two maps. However, it has been widely criticized because it assesses the similarity between the simulation and the reference map, but does not distinguish between the areas that change between the two dates and those that do not. Therefore, in maps that simulate permanence correctly, the Kappa metric will be high. Accordingly, we only recommend Kappa for assessing how well permanence is simulated, and it should not be used for a detailed assessment of the accuracy of simulated changes. The Kappa Simulation proposed by 
The Agreement between maps at global and stratum level (see Sect. 4 in chapter ""Metrics Based on a Cross-Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") analysis can assess for a specific LUC transition, for example, whether the agreement between an observed (reference map) and a simulated transition varies or not for several distance classes resulting from a driver (e.g. distance to roads). Other metrics, such as change statistics (see Sect. 1 in chapter ""Metrics Based on a Cross-Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps""), are widely used for characterizing the simulated changes, providing extra information that may be helpful for their validation.
Pontius proposes several metrics for validating simulated change (see chapter ""Pontius Jr. Methods Based on a Cross Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps""). Some of them can also be used to validate time series of LUC maps and were therefore described in Sect. 2. The LUCC budget (see Sect. 2 in chapter ""Pontius Jr. Methods Based on a Cross Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") technique helps users to understand the changes that take place between the simulation and the base map and between the reference and the base maps. This tool calculates the gross and net changes, overall and per category, as well as the category swaps, in both the simulated and the reference landscapes. This enables us to assess in detail whether the changes we simulated are similar to the changes that take place on the reference maps and follow the same trends.
Quantity & allocation disagreement (see Sect. 3 in chapter ""Pontius Jr. Methods Based on a Cross Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") differentiates, at an overall level and per category, between the (dis)agreement between two maps in terms of the proportion of the map occupied by each category (quantities) and the (dis) agreement due to the allocation of the categories in the same/different places on the map (allocation). It is therefore useful for assessing how much of the disagreement is due to the way the model simulates quantities and how much is due to its incorrect allocation of categories. By making the analysis at the category level, it also allows us to assess where (i.e. in which categories) the errors and uncertainties arise.
If a chronological series of simulations (more than two-time points) is available, Incidents and States (see Sect. 5 in chapter ""Pontius Jr. Methods Based on a Cross Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"" may also be employed. This metric helps identify pixels that follow illogical transition patterns, with changes at successive time intervals between the same pair of categories (e.g. from agricultural to urban fabric and then back to agricultural).
Intensity analysis (see Sect. 6 in chapter ""Pontius Jr. Methods Based on a Cross Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") compares the different intensities of change per category in simulations and reference maps over at least three points in time. In this way we can assess whether our model correctly simulated the change trend displayed by the reference data. The flow matrix (see Sect. 7 in chapter ""Pontius Jr. Methods Based on a Cross Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") could also be applied to validate simulated changes in a generic way, assessing the stability and instability of the real and simulated changes over time.
The Null model 
The Merit can be used to discover whether the model estimates more or less change than the reference map. It is also highly recommended for evaluating the congruence of model outputs and model robustness. This is a form of validation that evaluates the agreement between simulations obtained using different models or using the same model parametrized in different ways 
None of the above tools assesses the accuracy of the pattern of LUC change in the simulation. This aspect is important because even if the quantities simulated are wrong and the categories are not allocated in the same positions as in the reference maps, the pattern of LUC change may have been simulated correctly. Pattern can be validated using Spatial metrics (see Sect. 1 in chapter ""Spatial Metrics to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") and the Map Curves (see Sect. 1 in chapter ""Advanced Pattern Analysis to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") method, which compare the pattern of the simulation with the pattern of the reference landscape.
Spatial metrics characterize many different elements of the landscape: fragmentation, shape complexity, category proportions, diversity‚Ä¶. They can be calculated specifically for the simulated and reference changes, so allowing users to identify the specific pattern characteristics of the features that changed during the simulation period. In this way we can understand the size and shape of the simulated changes, inferring from this information how logical or uncertain they may be.
The MapCurves method gives a summary figure for the pattern agreement between two maps, and is therefore much easier to interpret. However, it does not provide all the complex detail that can be revealed by applying the different spatial metrics.
We can also analyse the changes that take place on the borders of existing patches and the changes that result in the appearance of new patches. This distinction may be useful for identifying errors or inconsistencies. The detection of change on pattern borders (see Sect. 2 in chapter ""Advanced Pattern Analysis to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") enables us to evaluate and identify errors in the simulations, which may be due to different parameters being applied in the model allocation procedure, such as, for example, the use of a contiguity filter. The Allocation distance error (see Sect. 3 in chapter ""Advanced Pattern Analysis to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") calculates the distance between wrongly simulated patches and reference patches, so as to gain a better picture of how well the patches are simulated. In this sense, a model that wrongly allocates change close to areas that actually change on the ground would be considered to have performed better than a model that allocates them further away.

The availability of LUC data has been increasing since the end of the last century, in line with the development of remote sensing techniques and easier access to aerial and satellite imagery. LUC data is available at all spatial scales, from local to global. Access to spatial information, including LUC datasets, has also improved in the last decade with the development of the open access culture.
Most of the LUC data being produced today refers to LUC maps, which are either single, one-off maps or form part of a time series. These maps provide layers of spatial data with LUC information for each part of the area being mapped at one (single maps) or several points in time (series of maps). Other spatial sources of LUC information include reference datasets used to validate LUC maps or train remote sensing classifiers. Although datasets of this kind have been produced since the beginning of the satellite remote sensing era, they have only recently become widely available for general purposes.
In this chapter, we review the main producers of LUC maps and the most relevant LUC datasets currently available -both LUC maps and data packages with reference data. Although this aspires to be a comprehensive review, some LUC products may be missing. We focus on the datasets that are available for download and can be used in practice. When relevant, we also mention others that are currently unavailable for download.
Many older LUC maps are not included, because they were drawn at very coarse resolution using old-fashioned production methods and therefore cannot meet the demands of modern users. Because of the scope and extent of the book, we focus exclusively on datasets at global and supra-national levels. A detailed description of the approach followed when carrying out this review appears in chapter ""About This Book"" of this book.
The most important datasets reviewed in this chapter are described in detail in Part IV of this book (chapters ""Global General Land Use Cover Datasets with a Single Date ""-""Supra-national Thematic Land Use Cover Datasets""), where users can find a detailed description of each dataset, including classification schemes, production methods and download options. | The Producers of LUC Data: We have classified LUC data producers into four main groups (Fig. 
At local and detailed scales, many organizations and users create their own LUC datasets. The fact that they have easy access to aerial/satellite imagery and to software for processing, photointerpreting and classifying these images has facilitated this process. This allows users to obtain very specific datasets that match their particular requirements. The datasets created for small projects and for specific purposes are not usually disseminated and remain the property of the communities or users that produce them. When these datasets are made available, they are often provided without the necessary technical information and general metadata.
At regional, national, supra-national and global scales, an increasing number of LUC databases are being produced for a broad range of users. Often these databases are specially designed for specific communities, such as the climate change research community. In other cases, they provide more general LUC information for a wide range of research fields and as support for policy decisions.
There are two main producers of LUC datasets. Firstly, nationally or internationally funded research projects, which Fig. 
Depending on the specific objectives of the projects and the institutions involved, these datasets may or may not be available for download. The quality of metadata and auxiliary information can also vary a lot from one project to the next. In some cases, a lot of technical and auxiliary information is provided, while in others users can only access the dataset itself and the research paper in which it is presented.
Governmental and other organizations are the other big producers of LUC data. In these cases, the objective is to provide information about the areas for which the organization is responsible or the areas affected by its policies and/or decisions. This data is a useful source of information for the policymaking process and is usually part of wider cartographic efforts by national and regional governments, and sometimes by international organizations, to provide geographic information of reference.
As these projects are part of official mapping work conducted by nations, regions and other large organizations, they are usually backed by significant long-term funding. These databases are therefore more likely to be updated or improved in the future. Another advantage is that they usually provide highly detailed, accurate information. They are also quite flexible. As a result, these databases are widely used by the whole scientific community, public and private sector professionals and many other users.
In recent years, there has been an increase in the data produced by members of the public through crowdsourcing or similar practices. This kind of information is known as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and is part of a movement called 'citizen science', in which private citizens participate in scientific research, either by gathering or validating data or by assisting in any of the other phases of the scientific process.
Approaches of this kind allow local knowledge and expertise to be incorporated into data production. Highly detailed, up-to-date datasets can be produced easily and cheaply. Nevertheless, important issues can arise in terms of data quality and uncertainty, due to possible inconsistencies in the methods and procedures followed by the contributors, their different levels of expertise, etc. | Land Use Cover Maps: Reviewing all the LUC maps currently available is a daunting task, which perhaps explains why it has rarely been attempted. To our knowledge, the only researchers to carry out an extensive review of LUC maps at global and regional scales were 
The dividing line between general and thematic LUC products is not always clear. Some LUC maps, for example, provide general information on several different land covers (e.g. artificial, vegetation, water) while providing a detailed study of just one of them, thereby adopting a thematic approach. Although, in our review, we classify LUC maps as either general or thematic, readers should be aware of these possible inconsistencies.
Both types of LUC maps, general and thematic, can also be classified according to the extent they cover, differentiating between global, supranational, national, regional and local LUC maps. However, a comprehensive review of national, regional and local maps would be a huge task that is beyond the scope of this book. We will therefore be focusing exclusively on global and supranational LUC maps.
LUC maps for national and, especially, for regional and local areas, are usually only available for developed countries, or even highly developed countries, which can afford to invest in the production of spatial information and in research programmes. The most developed nations of the European Union, Australia and the United States usually have detailed LUC datasets, not only at a national level but also for specific regions. In China, the government has invested heavily in research, so enabling the production of national and regional LUC products. China is, together with the USA, the country producing most research on LUC mapping today  | Platforms and Repositories: A few online platforms and repositories provide an overview of the LUC datasets available. The Geo-Wiki platform (www.geo-wiki.org) is one of the most recent. It was initially developed to collect reference LUC information through crowdsourcing and to create a hybrid LUC map. It now hosts both general and thematic LUC maps. The Google Earth Engine Platform, which was also recently launched, includes a repository of spatial datasets, with a specific section devoted to Land Cover data (https://developers.google.com/ earth-engine/datasets/tags/landcover).
The FAO Geonetwork repository (www.fao.org/ geonetwork/) makes a great deal of spatial datasets available to users. The repository includes a specific section on LUC data. It hosts LUC maps at all scales and is a valuable source of LUC information for developing countries. The Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) (https:// lpdaac.usgs.gov/) holds most of the LUC datasets produced by NASA and the United States Geological Survey (USGS), in addition to other important global datasets.
The Copernicus Land Monitoring System website (https://land.copernicus.eu/) is the main source of LUC products created through the Copernicus programme, and is of particular interest for those working with European LUC information. All Copernicus layers are also available through the WEkEO Copernicus DIAS service (https://wekeo.eu/), a cloud-based platform that provides access to Copernicus datasets and to various tools for processing them, including all the land monitoring data. | General Land Use Cover Maps:  | Global LUC Maps: The production of global LUC datasets started at the end of the twentieth century. By then, coarse-resolution satellite imagery was available for producing consistent global LUC datasets at a low cost. A previous attempt had been made to create a global LUC map through photointerpretation of aerial imagery 
The first global general LUC map of which we have record dates from 1994 (Table 
The next global LUC maps were also produced by the team from Maryland. These were an improvement on their original map. Two maps were produced at spatial resolutions of 8 km and 1 km, respectively 
A lot of new maps have been produced since these first global general LUC maps appeared, especially since 2010. Tables 
As in the case of the pioneering maps from the University of Maryland, all the datasets reviewed here have been Most of these datasets are intended for use in climate change modelling, for which coherent global LUC maps at coarse resolutions are required. However, these databases are becoming increasingly popular and are used for many other purposes, a lot of them related with land change. This has been one of the drivers promoting the creation of new maps, with better quality and higher detail.
Below, we characterize the global LUC datasets produced in the last decades according to their method of production, level of accuracy and spatial, temporal and thematic resolutions. Over this period, map production methods have becoming increasingly complex in order to create more accurate maps that provide better spatial, temporal and thematic information. | The Production Methods: Nowadays, global LUC maps are created using improved and innovative production methods, involving advanced classifiers, such as those based on machine learning, as well as a lot of auxiliary data. In many cases, specific LUC categories are mapped through several specific procedures due to their particular patterns, reflectance behaviour, etc. Additional post-classification treatments have also become common in a bid to avoid some of the uncertainties and errors associated with the production of these maps.
In recent years, due to the increasing availability of LUC datasets, more and more global LUC maps are being produced by data fusion, in which new maps are created by combining existing datasets using a range of different algorithms and approaches. The aim of these projects is to create datasets with higher levels of accuracy and, therefore, less uncertainty. To this end, they usually combine the most accurate or highest quality LUC information from each dataset.
FAO-GLCShare is perhaps the best-known example of an attempt to build a new global LUC map from data fusion. It was created in 2014 by merging high-quality detailed national and regional LUC databases 
LUC maps obtained from data fusion do not have a single specific date of reference for the mapped area. When first produced, they are considered as up-to-date LUC databases. However, if they are not updated frequently, they eventually become obsolete and can no longer be regarded as useful sources for LUC change analysis.
The maps obtained through crowdsourcing, i.e. by aggregating a large number of individual inputs supplied by a community of people, could undergo the same problems. Although still relatively rare, they could play an important role in the future. OSM-LULC, released in 2017 
The recent advent of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform has encouraged the production of new global LUC maps, some general and others thematic. GEE provides a powerful cloud computing service, giving users the chance to process and classify tons of satellite imagery. This is particularly important when users do not have the necessary computer power to do this themselves. The availability of cloud-computing services will lead to an increase, in the near future, in the number of highly detailed LUC products being created using complex computer production methods. Many of these will be produced at global scales. | Accuracy: The development and application of new methods and techniques to produce LUC maps has not improved the accuracy of these datasets. Although some global LUC maps are more accurate than others, there is no correlation between time, the introduction of new methods and techniques and the achievement of higher levels of accuracy 
Global LUC datasets usually have accuracy levels of over 60%. In the best cases, they are around 80%. They are therefore still subject to high degrees of uncertainty. This is to be expected given the high level of abstraction they require. The entire surface of the Earth is being mapped according to the same method and must fit into the same legend. This means there is little room for local or regional specificities, which inevitably introduces a degree of uncertainty. | Spatial Resolution: LUC mapping has evolved over time, with the result that global LUC maps are produced at an increasing number of spatial resolutions. Initially, the AVHRR and VEGETA-TION sensors, with a spatial resolution of 1 km, were the main source of imagery for global LUC mapping. Later, imagery from MODIS (500 m) and MERIS (300 m) became the standard source of information. In recent years, it has become increasingly common to use the huge stock of Landsat imagery to produce global LUC maps at 30 m. Some projects have gone even further, producing global LUC maps at even finer resolutions. One example is the 2017 edition of FROM-GLC (10 m) 
Sentinel satellites will be providing free, long-term, high-quality imagery over the coming years. This may boost the production of global LUC maps at increasingly high levels of detail. | Temporal Resolution: The temporal resolution of LUC maps has also increased over time, especially in recent years. Historical time series of LUC maps are becoming more common (Table 
However, in most of these series, LUC change cannot be reliably detected by cross-tabulating the different maps that make up the dataset. Different methods of production for each year, changes in the source of imagery, differences in the reflectance of the images, etc., introduce a lot of noise in the comparison. This makes it impossible to obtain meaningful results from LUC change analyses.
The latest version of the MODIS Land Cover (Collection 6) incorporated important changes in the product algorithm and workflow to account for these sources of uncertainty 
New time series of LUC maps have been produced recently with the specific purpose of enabling change detection. These include the LC-CCI (ESA 2017) and GLASS-GLC maps  | Classification Schemes: Unlike the spatial and temporal resolutions, there are no important variations over time in the thematic resolution of most global LUC products. In fact, standard LUC classification systems are now widely used so as to ensure that the different databases are comparable. One of the most common is the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme   | Supra-national LUC Maps: A lot of international institutions and organizations need comprehensive and coherent worldwide data to support their activities. Global datasets are also required by research communities that study the whole Earth as a system. For their part, national governments and organizations require large amounts of data to support policymaking at a national level. Many other institutions, associations, professionals and researchers need very detailed data that is only available at regional and local scales.
Within this context, supra-national datasets do not provide much detail and work at a different scale to that at which most institutions and organizations implement their policies. They therefore do not meet the requirements of the research and policy-making communities working at global scales. This means that there is less interest and consequently less funding for datasets at these scales, hence the relative lack of supra-national LUC maps. Supra-national LUC maps have been developed by the European institutions to assist policymaking and environmental monitoring in Europe. In other continents, supra-national LUC maps are usually developed within the context of different projects funded by international institutions, such as the FAO and various different US and European institutions. The latter include the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission, which have been actively involved in the production of supra-national LUC maps for many developing areas with important biodiversity values. | Europe: Europe is the continent with the widest range of supra-national LUC maps. The European Union (EU) has certain powers over the European environment and is therefore interested in monitoring any changes in land use. To this end, the EU has invested in the production of EU-wide reference data as a reliable source of information on which to base their policy decisions. As a consequence, plenty of detailed, high-quality datasets are now available providing LUC information for the European continent (Table 
Of all the European LUC datasets, CORINE Land Cover (CLC) is by far the best known. It is one of the oldest and most successful programmes on land monitoring, offering very high levels of accuracy and detail. All these qualities have made CLC a reference in LUC mapping worldwide. It is the only cross-country initiative working at similar scales that provides detailed, temporally rich LUC data, which can be used effectively for change detection. CLC is one of the best examples of decentralized, coordinated LUC mapping. CLC is produced at a national level, which allows European countries to develop their own national datasets while taking advantage of the work and the resources invested to create CLC.
A few non-European countries have mapped the land uses and covers in their entire nations or in certain specific areas following the CLC model. Some of them have done so with the help of the European institutions and other European research groups. These include Palestine, Morocco, Tunisia, San Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Colombia, Burkina Faso and Gabon 
Through the Copernicus programme, the EU has also developed coherent and consistent LUC mapping products aimed at monitoring the LUC dynamics of specific areas (e.g. coastal and metropolitan areas, riparian zones, Natura 2000 network‚Ä¶). These are very detailed products in both spatial and thematic terms, which have been designed to meet the needs of their potential community of users or to provide information in support of a range of different policies. Their production is centralized, so avoiding the inconsistencies that might result from a coordinated, decentralized production method. Although they were only recently launched, the EU has assured their long-term continuity, so providing consistent time series of data.
Two other series of LUC maps, which are complementary to CLC, are also available for Europe. Annual Land Cover is a recently launched product that provides annual LUC maps, so overcoming the temporal resolution limitations of CLC, which is only updated once every 6 years. Annual Land Cover is produced as part of a project funded by the European Commission, which aims to create harmonized spatial datasets for Europe. However, it is not recommended for change detection, as there is a lot of inter-annual variability between LUC covers.
HILDA is another LUC dataset providing a long time series of LUC maps for Europe. Although it has a coarser resolution, it provides the longest time series of maps reviewed here: 1900-2010. It was produced by a research project team, who combined various different datasets and applied complex modelling techniques  | Africa: A large number of supra-national LUC maps have also been found for Africa (Table 
Only a few projects tried to offer an overview of the LUC covers for the entire African continent. The FAO mapped the covers for many African countries as part of the AFRI-COVER project, but did not encompass the whole continent. The first comprehensive, Africa-specific, general LUC dataset only appeared quite recently. It was produced by EU research and earth-observation organizations. No similar initiatives have been found for America, Asia and Oceania. They are also quite rare for Europe as a whole, where continental LUC data usually covers the EU and associated countries.
There are three datasets providing a time series of LUC maps for different African countries. However, only one of these (West Africa Land Use Land Cover) was obtained by applying a common mapping approach which provides LUC information for all mapped areas at the same dates. In the other two, the time series is made up of national or regional LUC maps produced for different years of reference, so hampering cross-country LUC change analyses. | The Americas: In the Americas, there is a clear distinction between the datasets covering North America and those covering South America and the Caribbean (Table 
South America 30 m, developed by  | Asia and Antarctica: We only found one supra-national dataset for Asia, which covered the LUC of the Himalayan region (Table 
No supra-national maps are available for Oceania, due to its particular characteristics in which continental areas and islands are usually separate individual nations. These countries have no shared continental or inland regions for which a supra-national LUC dataset might be useful. As a result, no datasets of this kind have been produced.
Finally, a specific LUC map for Antarctica was produced recently by Chinese researchers  | Thematic Land Use Cover Datasets: Thematic Land Use Cover (LUC) datasets map parts of the Earth's surface as a specific land cover, considering not just its extent but also its intensity of distribution. They normally focus on land covers and provide very little information about land use. Thematic LUC maps are usually produced using automatic remote sensing techniques that find accurate land use characterization difficult. Thematic LUC maps usually represent land covers in greater detail than general LUC maps. Some provide information about the proportion of the study area occupied by a particular land cover on the ground. In other cases, they delineate the extent of a specific cover with great detail and accuracy. Other thematic LUC maps share certain features with general LUC maps, in that they map the Earth according to a set of predefined categories, which are usually subclasses of a specific type of cover (e.g. vegetation). Many maps charting vegetation in its various different forms can therefore be regarded as thematic sources of LUC information in that they characterize a specific cover.
Some maps may provide thematic information about specific land covers together with other relevant data. This was especially true in the twentieth century, when many different maps combining biogeographic and climate information were produced for the climate and other research communities. These maps were usually produced by merging different techniques and datasets. Examples include the maps produced by 
Prior to the advent of satellite remote sensing, there were also a large number of traditional maps obtained through photointerpretation of aerial imagery and field surveys that provided information on certain specific land covers. These maps charted vegetation above all and, to a lesser extent, agricultural areas. These can be useful sources of information for historical LUC change analysis. However, as they are usually only available for national or more detailed areas and in many cases have not been digitalized, they are not reviewed here either.
There are also plenty of other spatial datasets that provide useful information for studying specific land covers. One example for vegetation covers are maps of live biomass 
The progress made in recent decades in the production of general LUC maps has also been achieved in thematic LUC mapping, with increasing levels of detail and more innovative, more complex methods. Some of the newest products have been produced using the cloud-computing capabilities of Google Earth Engine, which seems likely to play a key role in thematic LUC mapping in the future, and will allow more thematic datasets to be produced. Until now, the Landsat archive has been the most detailed source of imagery for LUC thematic mapping, although the imagery provided by the Sentinel constellation of satellites will soon enable users to expand the catalogue of thematic LUC datasets at highly detailed spatial resolutions of less than 30 m. | Global Thematic LUC Maps Focusing: on Vegetation Covers One of the most common features mapped by thematic LUC products is natural vegetation and tree and forest covers in particular. In fact, forest monitoring is one of the main applications of Landsat data, as reviewed by 
LUC maps focusing on vegetation covers usually offer coherent time series of LUC data that support change detection (Table 
VCF datasets provide information about the vegetation cover fraction for each pixel in the analysed area. FCover is the only dataset that provides information on the percentage of vegetation cover, whereas all the others focus on tree or forest covers. Whereas FCover considers all kinds of natural vegetation, MEaSUREs VCF (VCF5KYR), MODIS VCF (MOD44B), Landsat VCF (GFCC) and the Hansen Forest Map focus exclusively on tree covers. In addition, GFCC and Hansen Forest Map include specific layers of forest change. Forests are mapped as such when a minimum fraction of their area is covered by trees. Therefore, changes in tree cover changes do not necessarily mean forest changes.
Two recent projects have explored the potential of radar data for mapping forest extent  | Global Thematic LUC Maps Focusing: on Agricultural Covers Agricultural areas are also widely mapped with specific LUC products (Table 
Unlike other LUC thematic products, those mapping agricultural areas do not usually offer a time series, which means they cannot be used for land change analysis. Mapping agricultural areas is quite complex and this has hindered the production of coherent time series of agricultural LUC maps. One exception to this general trend was the dataset by  | Global Thematic LUC Maps Focusing: on Artificial Covers Built-up areas are becoming a common subject for thematic LUC products. As with the datasets focusing on vegetation covers, they provide time series of data which support change detection (Table  | Supra-national Thematic LUC Maps: We have only reviewed a few experiences of supra-national thematic LUC mapping (Table 
The European Commission, through the Copernicus programme, is behind some of the few supra-national thematic LUC datasets that focus on other covers such as artificial surfaces or agricultural areas. | Reference Land Use Cover Data: Reference data is required to train supervised remote sensing classifiers and to validate LUC maps. Reference LUC datasets consist of a series of geographically distributed sample points with LUC information. Each point contains information about the specific land use or cover in the pixel or polygon of the Earth's surface represented by the point.
The reference datasets are subject to the same spatial abstraction required in LUC maps. Reference points are associated with a specific pixel or polygon. The level of abstraction required varies depending on the size of these points. The uncertainty of the reference information will also vary accordingly. The fact that a single land use or cover is assigned to a whole pixel or polygon, even though they may contain other land uses or covers, can also produce uncertainty. In addition, there is always a degree of subjectivity in the decision to assign a pixel or polygon to a particular category, especially in borderline cases that are not clear-cut. This can create an additional source of uncertainty.
Relatively few general LUC reference datasets are currently available. This is because many reference datasets were created ad hoc every time a new LUC map was validated or reference data was required to train a remote sensing classifier, and it was therefore unnecessary to have a ready supply of general LUC reference datasets. These datasets are also affected by some degree of thematic generalization, as is any LUC map. LUC information must conform to a specific classification system or legend. Given the ad hoc nature of many reference datasets, the classification or legend used to classify the land uses and covers was normally also case-specific. However, the recent emergence of standard LUC reference datasets aimed at a wide range of users and research fields has extended the use of standard legends and classification systems, such as the FAO LCCS, when drawing up these datasets. One of the most renowned LUC reference datasets is the Land Use Cover Area frame Sample (LUCAS), produced by EUROSTAT every 3 years since 2006. It is made up of more than 330,000 survey points across the EU. 
In recent years, various reference datasets used to validate and train classifiers of global LUC maps have been made available online, so enabling them to be used for other purposes rather than just in the production of one specific map. The work done by the team from the GOFC-GOLD Land Cover Office is of special note. They collected and improved the reference datasets from six different LUC products (GLC2000, GlobCover 2005, STEP, VIIRS, GLCNMO and the urban dataset from the University of Tokyo). Samples of these datasets (with up to 70% of all the available reference points) are freely available for download on the project website. 
The most famous of these initiatives is Geo-Wiki, which is frequently used to collect LUC information for calibration and validation practices. Geo-Wiki provides a user-friendly online tool that makes it very ease to visualize LUC maps and to collect the reference LUC data required to validate them. Many international research projects working on LUC mapping and citizen science have based their research on Geo-Wiki. One of the most important is the H2020 Land-Sense Citizen Observatory.
Many other tools and platforms have been developed in recent years with similar purposes: Collect Earth, GLFC LT, VIEW-IT‚Ä¶ 
Although they cannot be considered LUC data as such, volunteered geo-referenced photographs may be useful for obtaining reference LUC datasets. They provide a fixed picture of a landscape at a given point in time. By analysing the picture, users can identify the dominant land cover or land use, so obtaining LUC reference data.
Several initiatives for collecting volunteered photographs of specific geographic locations are already ongoing. Flickr is one of the most famous, although its purposes and objectives have little to do with science or scientific methods. The Degree Confluent Project (DCF) | Further Reading: Fonte CC, Bastin L,

The paper compares and analyses 12 LUC reference datasets in detail. These datasets are used in the production and validation of global LUC maps. This is one of the most comprehensive reviews of the LUC reference datasets currently available. It also assesses the potential reuse of these datasets, focusing on the data requirements imposed by different user communities. The authors try to identify the particular features that LUC reference datasets must have to enable them to be used by a wide range of users.

However, the communicating power of the final maps may be impaired, if any of the cartographic transformations performed during the mapping process does not adapt well to the particular subject or area being mapped. This chapter takes the reader on a guided tour through the map production process, offering an overview of the cartographic language, the rules and practices that contribute to the success of the map as a communication tool and the most common forms in which LUC maps appear. Recent developments in geovisualization tools applied to LUC are also discussed. | Introduction: The main purpose of cartography is to communicate geospatial information. The map serves as a channel through which a message is transmitted from the sender-the mapmaker-to the receiver-the map user 
Like any other communication tool, cartography possesses its own language. The term ""language"" has been used by a number of authors in this field and can be defined as a system of signs enabling communication 
Subsequently, various studies explored this concept in greater depth, culminating in 1967 with the seminal piece by Jacques Bertin ""Semiology of Graphics"", a genuine world reference on this subject. This was followed in 1978 by Ratajski, who outlined that, in modern thematic cartography, the ultimate goal of semiotics is to build an accurate, unambiguous cartographic language.
In cartography, semiotics unfolds as two different categories of signs; on the one hand it refers to geometric signs, the spatial dimensions (zero, one, two or three) and the geometric nature of map features (points, lines, polygons and volumes), and on the other, to visual variables, defined as the possible elementary variations in perceptible marks 
In this chapter we will be focusing on both kinds of signs and their role in the cartographic representation of land use/land cover (LUC).
Recent technological advances in the GIS industry have popularized cartography, giving rise to what some people refer to as a ""geospatial society"" in which maps are increasingly ubiquitous and used in all kinds of applications. This has brought new opportunities for cartography as a science but it also poses new challenges, one of which is that many new mapmakers lack the necessary cartographic skills to produce effective maps. Unfortunately, there are numerous examples in the literature that illustrate the fact that GIS has made it easy to produce large numbers of wrong or F. Escobar (&) Departamento de Geolog√≠a, Geograf√≠a y Medio Ambiente, Universidad de Alcal√°, Alcal√° de Henares, Spain e-mail: francisco.escobar@uah.es confusing maps more quickly than ever before. In the case of LUC mapping, no matter how sophisticated and expensive the technology for the collection and processing of the information may be, inexpert mapmakers often fail to communicate the relevant information correctly.
In order to help overcome these issues, this chapter aims to provide the basic ground rules for the correct representation and interpretation of LUC maps. | Geometric Signs: The geographic entities we find in the landscape are portrayed on maps as cartographic objects of varying geometric nature. Different land use areas are no exception and are usually depicted as polygons. The process for representing this information on a 2-dimensional piece of paper or on a screen is anything but simple as it involves, at least, the following transformations; (1) projecting the irregular and curved surface of the Earth on a plane, ( 
(3) aggregating the information at the right administrative level when analysing LUC distribution over statistical spatial units. These three transformations have important implications for LUC mapping, which we will now go on to explain. | Cartographic Projection and LUC Mapping: The representation of our curved planet on a 2-dimensional map requires the application of mathematical models, known as cartographic or mapping projections, to project the Earth's surface on a plane 
‚Ä¢ Conformal projections are used in navigation charts, as their main characteristic is the preservation of angles. Parallels and meridians intersect in a perpendicular manner, so forming four 90¬∫ angles at each intersection and an orthogonal network as a whole. However, these maps show important distortions in terms of the proportionality of areas and distances. ‚Ä¢ Equidistant projections preserve the distances between specific pairs of points and distort areas and angles. These kinds of projections are mainly used in engineering and construction works. ‚Ä¢ Equivalent or equal area projections preserve the proportionality of areas and by doing so distort the shapes and distances.
The bigger the area represented, the greater the impact of our choice of projection. This is noticeable in world maps where familiarity with the shapes of countries and continents make it easy for the reader to understand the deformations in each case. However, in smaller areas whose shape is not usually familiar to the general population, the map reader will find it difficult to notice the deformations. Of course, given the limited portion of the Earth's surface portrayed, the effects of the deformations are not as obvious as in world maps, but they do exist and can have an impact on LUC mapping. Since the choice of the projection results in significantly different maps, as Fig.  | The Minimum Mapping Unit in LUC Maps: The minimum mapping unit, or MMU, defines the size of the smallest cartographic object that will appear on the map 
Today, the predominance of digital maps over paper-based maps and their capacity to zoom in and out mean that the MMU is not as obvious as in the past. However, all maps are affected by the mapmaker's choices regarding their final scale, and the MMU has to be set in such a way as to facilitate the useability and readability of the map. In digital maps, the zoom feature may incorporate 'intelligent' functions, which allow it to display certain map elements, features and labels, solely at the appropriate level of zoom. The result is that when the user zooms out, the smaller features are hidden and when they zoom in again, more and more small features become visible. For the intelligent zoom to work properly, the mapmaker must establish a different MMU at each zoom level, in this way deciding which elements will be visible at each different scale, an important decision in the mapmaking process.
CORINE Land Cover is a well-known European project, which established an MMU of 25 hectares for areal entities and a minimum width of 100 m for linear features (European Environment Agency 2017). This means that in a printed map at the recommended working scale of 1:100,000 the MMU will occupy 0.5 cm 2 or 25 mm 2 .
The MMU also plays an important role in the data collection phase. Regardless of whether data is collected by field work or by interpretation of aerial or satellite imagery, the features that are smaller than the MMU will not appear on the map.
Some authors work almost exclusively with raster structures for which the pixel is the basic unit. As a result, they tend to conceive the MMU in terms of pixel size. From this perspective, it is generally accepted that the smallest observable feature in the final map, i.e. the MMU, should comprise at least four contiguous pixels 
When it comes to determining the MMU of LUC maps, it is important to differentiate between databases and maps. Patches that might be a suitable size for data analysis could be completely inappropriate for map publishing. Single pixels or small groups of pixels forming small areas below the MMU threshold might be considered in data analysis, but would not appear on the map.
Three intrinsic characteristics of LUC mapping must be taken into consideration when deciding the most appropriate MMU: (i) Confusion between use and coverage, (ii) Definition of land use categories and associated land size, and (iii) High sensitivity of LUC maps to the interrelations between MMU and scale. The scale at which LUC information is expressed also has an enormous impact on the communication capacity of the resulting map 
In what is a common confusion between land use and land cover, different MMUs can result in maps showing different categories. For instance, at a relatively coarse resolution, a MMU of 1 km 2 would lead to an airport being depicted as such in both a land use map and a land cover Conic (equidistant). For demonstration purposes only, the differences between (d) and (e) have been accentuated by applying a World and a European projection system respectively map. However, if we increase the resolution by reducing the MMU to 50 m, the land use map would still depict it as an airport, but the land cover map would classify the areas covered by runways, buildings, or green areas into different categories.
The second characteristic of LUC information that affects the MMU is directly related to the first. The increasing availability of Earth observation products with greater spatial resolution could lead to the false idea that the higher the resolution of the images, the better the quality of the data obtained from them. However, land use, i.e. the ""arrangements, activities and inputs people undertake in a certain land cover type to produce, change or maintain it"" (Di Gregorio and Jansen 2000) cannot be observed in areas smaller than that required to carry out said activities and arrangements. For instance, the MMU for a LUC map category representing low-density residential development must be at least as small as the basic unit (house with garden) for this kind of land use.
The third intrinsic characteristic of LUC information that impacts on the MMU is its nature as a covering phenomenon. Mapping LUC information involves the delimitation of areas showing homogeneous coverage. This poses a problem in the data collection phase of small-scale LUC maps, in which the MMU covers a significantly large area that probably includes several LUC categories. In these cases, the identification of homogenous areas becomes a much more complex task. In order to assign a single value to the area in question, the cartographer must apply one of the available criteria. The most frequently used criteria include allocating the area: (i) to the LUC category covering the largest proportion of the area or (ii) to the predominant LUC category in the surrounding area. Related issues arise when attempting to downscale or upscale previously existing geospatial information. This increases the uncertainty of the map  | The Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) and the Category Aggregation Problem (CAP): LUC can be mapped and conceptualized in different ways; from the most typical LUC maps in which the areas are classified into homogeneous categories, to choropleth maps which summarize, at selected administrative levels, different statistical values for the LUC they contain. In all cases, LUC information is expressed via polygon-based geometry but the MAUP is most noticeable in choropleth maps.
The MAUP was analysed in depth by Openshaw and Taylor (1979) and its effects have been tested in a number of research studies 
LUC mapmakers and users need to be aware of the impact of the MAUP in order to facilitate both successful communication and well-informed decision-making.
Another issue in relation to the downscaling of information is the Category Aggregation Problem (CAP), which was formulated more recently 
In LUC these constraints are key aspects in the correct production and analysis of related maps. Figure  | Visual Variables: The expression 'visual variable' was used by J.  | Shape: Shape is the first variation distinguishable on any map. It helps identify the different types of objects appearing on a map, which are described by different contours. These contours may be regular and abstract (geometric signs) or figurative (pictograms). Shape corresponds to a nominal level of measurement and only allows us to convey either associations between objects with the same shape or differences between elements represented by different shapes. Shape is neither ordinal nor quantitative and cannot therefore be used for thematic phenomena with ordinal or quantitative levels of measurement 
In LUC mapping as in any other kind of polygon-based mapping, shape can only affect filling patterns, not the shape of the polygons themselves. The only exception to this rule are cartograms, in which both the size and the shape of polygon objects vary in line with quantitative thematic values. In maps showing point and line features, shape is frequently used to highlight different associations between categorical objects. | Orientation: The orientation of a sign refers to its position relative to a reference framework and it is expressed in degrees (between 0 and 360). As with shape, orientation can only represent the attributes on a nominal level of measurement and can only affect point-based elements  | Colour Hue: Colour hue (often referred to simply as colour) is the most complex visual variable and its use in maps has been extensively analysed by cartographers 
As a visual variable on a map, unlike shape and orientation, colour can be used not only in points, but also in lines and polygons. As regards its properties in relation to thematic information, colour is selective, separative and associative. Colour hues are neither ordered nor quantitative, which means they cannot be used to represent attributes measured at quantitative scales, and are therefore only suitable for representing phenomena measured at nominal scales. However, under certain conditions and when arranged in the appropriate order, colours can also be used to express order and opposition. For instance, yellow, orange and red can represent low, medium, and high data values, respectively (White 2017). In addition to Bertin's pioneer work and the revisions to his visual variables made by subsequent authors, a milestone in the application of colour hue schemes in digital mapping is the ColorBrewer Tool developed by Cynthia Brewer at Penn State University (Brewer 2021). The ColorBrewer tool offers an extensive collection of colour ramps, which are well-suited for any measure of scale and for colour-blind map users. In terms of LUC mapping, an interesting proposal for colouring LUC maps with coarse pixel data can be found in 
The use of colour in mapping is also affected by its cultural connotations. As pointed out by 
In addition to these cultural constraints, for map communication to be successful, the use of colour in mapping must honour some generally accepted conventionalisms. In LUC mapping, for instance, water bodies are always represented in light blue, while residential areas are normally depicted in red.
A very useful, well-known colour scheme for LUC mapping was established by the European Environmental Agency in the Corine Land Cover project (EEA 2017). Its 44 categories are represented by colours whose different hues are assigned to different groups of categories. In this way, artificial areas are represented in reds and purples, agricultural uses in yellow, forests in green, open spaces in grey and green, and wetlands and water bodies in blue. | Colour Value: White (2017) defined colour value as the lightness or darkness of a colour from pure black to pure white. Its variation constitutes ""a continuous progression which the eye perceives in the grayscale stretching from black to white"" (Bertin 1967) in a given area. 
As this is an excellent way of expressing order, it highlights the differences in a hierarchical system. Even though it is frequently used to represent quantities, the human capacity to associate different colour values with different quantities is very limited. Today, however, digital mapping allows black to be allocated in amounts that vary in proportion with the thematic value, so making it possible to use value ramps that overcome this limitation.
Like colour hue, colour value can be used in all geometric forms, although the best results are obtained on an area or volume, as the map user requires a certain minimum amount of surface area to perceive the variations of grey.
Since colour value is not suitable for representing nominal data, in LUC maps it is only used to summarize quantitative variables related to land use within administrative areas. | Texture: Texture or pattern is a complex visual variable that comprises a varying number of components depending on the author you consult. According to White (2017), textures combine size, value, hue, shape and orientation. Other authors reduce these components to shape, arrangement, grain and spacing. Shape is the basic graphic unit making up texture. Arrangement refers to the layout of the basic graphic elements, either regular or irregular. Grain refers to the size of these elements and spacing to the distance between them. The use of textures for data measured at different levels is also controversial. While White recommends that textures only be used for nominal and ordered attributes of areas and lines, other authors 
Nowadays, textures are not used as often in mapping as they once were. In the past, when colour printing was significantly more expensive, textures were frequently used to fill out areas containing nominal, ordinal or quantitative information. Today textures have largely been replaced by colour. However, they are sometimes used in combination with other covering visual variables such as colour hue or colour value, so as to increase the amount of information provided by the map.
Textures can be useful in LUC mapping when the basic LUC information is combined with other relevant information. In the case shown in Fig.  | Size: Size is, together with colour value, the most frequently used visual variable for representing quantitative data. Size can be defined as the variation in the area or the volume of a sign. It is rarely used in LUC mapping as these maps are normally based on categorical data. Although in theory, size expresses quantity, order and selection (Bertin 1967), its use in representing qualitative information can lead to confusion. Thus, size is only recommended for representing ordinal or quantitative data.
As regards the geometries of the map, size can only be fully applied to points. In the case of lines, since the distance between two points is fixed, size can only be applied as a variation in line width. As for polygons, any variation in their size based on a quantitative attribute other than surface area would result in the loss of their cartographic projection properties. Given this constraint, when the nature of the attribute is such that its representation with size is recommended, polygons may be represented by a point, usually at their centroid, which varies in size according to the value attached to the polygon attribute.
LUC map products using this visual variable are therefore limited to those summarising quantities such as the proportion of land occupied by each land use category, the proportion of land undergoing a land use change between two dates, or other related quantitative variables. In all cases, these quantities are summarized on a superimposed spatial structure, usually administrative units. | Visual Variables and Geometric Dimension: In the previous paragraphs, we have seen how some visual variables adapt better than others to the varying geometric forms in which geographical information is presented.
Figure  | Visual Variables and Measurement Level: In the above descriptions of the visual variables, we also outlined the meanings with which they are associated, and consequently the most suitable level of measurement for them. In general terms, the visual variables that can be ordered (colour value, size, texture and colour hue if properly ordered) are best suited for attributes measured at ordinal level. Visual variables indicating quantity (size and to some extent colour value and texture) can be applied to represent attributes at interval or ratio measurement levels. For their part, the visual variables with selective and associative properties, such as colour hue, shape and orientation, are used to represent attributes measured at nominal level.
Orientation is a special case. It usually has the same meaning as shape, but under certain conditions it can also be used to represent ordered attribute series. For instance, an arrow symbol pointed at any angle in the 360¬∞of a circle could be associated with an ordered attribute depicting every point in a hierarchy based on the angle of the arrow.
As regards textures, their complex nature makes them suitable for any measurement level. Changes in the shape, orientation and colour hue of the pattern of elements that make up the texture would apply to attributes at nominal scale while size and colour value variations would be used to represent attributes at quantitative and ordinal measurement scales. Figure  | Representing Nominal LUC Data: Most common LUC maps depict an area or region, highlighting with different colours the homogeneous patches of the different LUC categories it contains. As described above, for these maps to serve as successful communication tools, they must comply with a series of cartographic rules.
In terms of cartographic projection, the proportionality of areas must be preserved. If not, it would be impossible to compare the respective size of the different categories on the map. Equivalent projection must therefore be used.
The final size of the map will determine the scale and therefore the size of the Minimum Mapping Unit. In the case of digital maps, we recommend that an intelligent zoom be used so that the map only displays features equal to or greater than the minimum size. As a fixed image, the final LUC map must also strike a balance between the MMU and the number of LUC categories.
The visual variable best suited for categorical data is colour hue. Its use in LUC mapping must adhere to generally accepted conventions such as the use of blue colours to represent water bodies, reds and purples for built-up areas and so on.
In line with these recommendations, Fig.  | Representing LUC Quantitative Data: As pointed out above, the cartographic representation of LUC quantitative data requires additional layers, such as administrative units, for the computation of these quantities at a meaningful spatial level. Some sort of selection must be undertaken in order for the resulting maps to be readable. Figure 
As with any map representing quantitative attributes, special attention must be paid to the number of intervals and their limits. An excessive number of intervals would make it difficult to differentiate between the associated symbols, regardless of whether they are based on size or colour value. By contrast, if too few intervals are used, this will reduce the level of detail of the information provided by the map.  | Representing LUC Changes: One of the key areas in LUC studies is the analysis of the cover changes that have taken place in the past or are predicted to occur in the future, according to different scenarios 
The cartographic representation of the LUC change that has taken place between these two dates is often expressed in terms of the amount of land gained or lost by each land use category. This is a quantitative attribute and is therefore subject to the constraints summarized in Sect. 5.
As regards the representation of categories as nominal data, an excessively large number of land use categories in the input maps and their associated, theoretically possible transitions would in turn result in an excessively large number of new categories. This means that some kind of selection process must be performed. The options include: (i) reducing the map to the binary categories of ""stable"" and ""changed""; (ii) selecting just one land use category to represent the areas gained or lost by it; and (iii) selecting the areas gained or lost by one specific land use category, in order to represent the land use categories from which or to which these areas have changed.
In order to make the comparison, the two input maps must be overlaid. During this process, it is highly likely that new areas of varying size will appear on the output map. The issues relating to the MMU discussed in Sect. 2.2. apply to the representation or possible generalization of these new polygons. Figure  | New Forms of Visualizing and Communicating LUC Data: Throughout the examples presented so far, we have made clear that LUC representation is a far from simple task and that LUC maps convey even the most relevant aspects of LUC information with difficulty. These limitations can have serious consequences when it comes to taking policy and land planning decisions. The abstract representation, normally by means of colour hues, of land use categories or the transitions between them does not necessarily make it easier for users to understand the real landscape changes they represent. Policy makers may not be expert map users, and will therefore require more intuitive information in order to fully comprehend the impacts of predicted land use changes on landscapes, economy, society and the environment. 
In an attempt to alleviate these issues, various interesting case studies have integrated new approaches to cartographic visualization 
In addition to these realistic 3D examples, technological developments in the mapping industry have enabled the production of new cartographic tools that have yet to be explored in the communication of LUC information. Three areas are in need of further research and implementation. First, the current predominance of digital maps that are viewed through a computer device equipped with speakers, contrasts with the almost complete absence of research into sound mapping applied to LUC analysis. Second, the limited interactive capacity of LUC digital maps makes it difficult to compare them. And third, the possibilities offered by the computerised environment for visualizing animations, perhaps the most efficient tool for communicating changes over time, have yet to be applied in LUC change studies. | Conclusions: In this chapter we have reviewed the main cartographic methods for representing and communicating LUC and LUCC information. The maps produced must comply with basic cartographic rules and must therefore have an appropriate cartographic projection, a balanced level of generalization, MMU and attribute details, a suitable set of visual variables and, in the case of quantitative data, a proper method for the classification of the thematic variable.
Even the maps that comply with these rules are often not fully comprehensible for their final users. This may be because the scale used in the final printed maps, the format in which most decision-makers receive the information, is too small or simply because not all the actors involved ""speak"" the cartographic language.
In order to overcome these issues, new cartographic methods including geovisualization techniques like realistic 3D mapping, are being explored. Other technological advances like sound mapping, fully interactive mapping or animated mapping are still underused in LUC studies. The integration of realistic 3D models with animation and sound will enable the inclusion of moving living creatures (like animals or people), human-made moving objects (like vehicles or windmills), vegetation, topography, buildings, and variations in the atmosphere or the light. Progress of this kind in LUC representation will make LUC maps more realistic and will enhance their communication capabilities, which in turn will help ensure better-informed decision-making processes.

Unlike other chapters in this book, where maps are validated by comparison with other maps with better resolution and/or quality, this approach requires a ground sample dataset, i.e. a set of sites where LUC can be observed in the field or interpreted from high-resolution imagery. Map error is assessed using techniques based on statistical sampling. In general terms, in this approach, the accuracy of single LUC maps is assessed by comparing the thematic map against the reference data and measuring the agreement between the two. When assessing thematic accuracy, three stages can be identified: the design of the sample, the design of the response, and the estimation and analysis protocols. Sample design refers to the protocols used to define the characteristics of the sampling sites, including sample size and distribution, which can be random or systematic. Response design involves establishing the characteristics of the reference data, such as the size of the spatial assessment units, the sources from which the reference data will be obtained, and the criteria for assigning labels to spatial units. Finally, the estimation and analysis protocols include the procedures applied to the reference data to calculate accuracy indices, such as user's and producer's accuracy, the estimated areas covered by each category and their respective confidence intervals. This chapter has two sections in which we present a couple of exercises relating to sampling and response design; the sample size will be calculated, the distribution of sampling sites will be obtained using a stratified random scheme, and finally, a set of reference data will be obtained by photointerpretation at the sampling sites (spatial units). The accuracy statistics will be calculated later in Sect. 5 in chapter ""Metrics Based on a Cross-Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"" as part of the cross-tabulation exercises. The exercises in this chapter use fine-scale LUC maps obtained for the municipality of Marqu√©s de Comillas in Chiapas, Mexico. When conducting error assessment, it is important to strike a balance between the theoretical requirements and the practical reality of implementation 
There is no single right way to calculate the ideal sample size; in general, this task could be regarded as a process of successive approximations, in which criteria such as the availability of resources, levels of sampling error, or the desired degree of accuracy all play an important role. The expertise of the user and his/her interest in certain thematic classes are also important factors in the success of the estimation process.
An initial estimation of the most appropriate sample size can be made with the formulae used in statistical sampling. Equations for the validation of thematic maps have often been taken from the original work by 
where O = accuracy expressed as a proportion (in the case of simple random sampling O is the anticipated overall accuracy, whilst in stratified sampling it is the anticipated user's accuracy); n = number of sampling sites; z = percentile from the standard normal distribution (z = 1.96 for a 95% confidence interval); and d = desired half-width of the confidence interval of O. It can also be expressed as
In the case of stratified random sampling, 
where S(√î) = standard error of estimated overall accuracy; Wi = mapped proportion of the area of class I
; and Ui = User's accuracy for class i.
Note that in both cases, it is necessary for the user to define certain parameters in advance, such as the permissible level of error (S(√î)) or the user's accuracy values. These data should be obtained from prior or approximate knowledge regarding the quality of the map or from previous experience in producing maps with similar characteristics.
Sometimes it may be difficult to estimate user's accuracy, so practical recommendations for sample size calculation may be useful. 
Sampling design is another important factor to consider. Frequently used types include systematic, simple random and stratified random sampling. Traditionally, the cost or ease of fieldwork was a criterion for preferring some designs over others. With the increased availability of high-resolution imagery, in many cases, it is no longer essential to obtain data directly in the field. Reference data can now be interpreted from the imagery, so reducing costs dramatically.
The systematic sampling is easier to implement in the field, but has the disadvantage that it cannot be used to construct an unbiased variance estimator 
Regardless of the design chosen, a problem that sometimes arises is the under-representation of small or rare thematic classes in the sample. In other words, once the sample has been calculated and distributed, it may leave some classes with too few sites (<50). Some authors 
Once all the different stages of the accuracy assessment process have been performed, the precision values obtained should be reviewed, e.g. the magnitude of the overall accuracy standard error or the width of the user's accuracy confidence intervals. Even if there are some variations from the expected values, if the values obtained meet the analyst's targets as regards accuracy, then there would be no need to repeat the analysis 
QGIS Exercise: To calculate sample size and to distribute sample sites using a random stratified approach Next, we present a practical way to carry out the sampling design for obtaining reference data. In this exercise, we will estimate the sample size for a stratified random design, for which we will have to specify the expected standard error of the overall accuracy and to provide an a priori estimate of user's accuracy values. Sometimes, these figures may be difficult to provide in which case we can use the default values provided by the tool we will be using.
Available tools
There are several useful tools in QGIS for statistical sampling design. All of them are external plugins such as Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin (SCP), AcATaMa and MapAccurAssess. The MapAccurAssess plugin is a trial version specifically developed in the context of this book, which is not yet available in the official QGIS repositories.
SCP, which was developed by 
AcATaMa was developed by the Group from the Forest and Carbon Monitoring System for the validation of single LUC maps (Llano 2019). It consists of a set of tools that guide the user through a series of steps: (a) sampling design (stratified or simple); (b) sample classification; and (c) calculation of the confusion matrix and accuracy statistics. In the sample classification step, the spatial unit is a pixel (or points in the GeoPackage or shapefile format), which is not very convenient for those who prefer to use a different spatial unit, such as group of pixels or polygons. At that stage (classification), a set of tools is enabled to zoom in on each of the samples, and four windows are created to display images of interest. An editable attribute table is also created to classify the samples.
In this exercise, we will be using MapAccurAssess, a plugin developed by the authors of this chapter, which includes several of the suggestions proposed by 
This plugin provides several functions for calculating sample size in a stratified random design, using Neyman's optimal allocation to calculate the number of sampling sites in each thematic class. If, after that, any class has less than 50 sampling sites, it must be assigned between 50 and 100 sites depending on the complexity of the map. The result is a layer of points (shapefile) that are distributed over all the thematic categories of the map according to the stratified random design criteria. The points can be further modified to represent a polygon using QGIS functions. | Materials:  | Marqu√©s de Comillas Land Use Cover Map 2019:  | Requisites: To calculate the area of each thematic class the LUC map must be projected in any cartographic projection (not geographic coordinates). The plugin has been tested on map projections with distance units in metres (rather than feet for example). | Execution: Step 1
Install the MapAccurAssess plugin. All the relevant information regarding the installation of the plugin can be found in Chapter ""About This Book"" and the plugin's manual, which is included in the plugin's download.
Step 2
Go to the Plugins Menu, select the Accuracy Assessment and Random point options. Alternatively, you can click on the Random Point icon (Fig.  | MapAccurAssess plugin icon: Step 3
In the dialogue box in Fig. 
The Ui values (User's Accuracy for class i) refer to an a priori estimation of accuracy for the thematic class, which could be based on expert judgement or on previous assessments. If there are any doubts about these values, the default values can be retained. Whilst Ui can vary between 0 and 1, a value of 0.5 was allocated to a large number of sites. Values of over 0.5 will generate a smaller sample size. The last stage is to select the folder where the results will be saved. | Results and Comments: The results are displayed in the Record tab, and two types of output are generated and saved in the selected folder: (i) a. csv file with statistics about the thematic classes and (ii) a point shapefile where the points represent the centres of the sampling sites.
The .csv file contains a row for each thematic class and four columns showing id, area, the number of sampling sites estimated using Neyman's optimal criteria and the suggested number of sampling sites, adjusted to ensure that none of the classes have less than 50 sites (Table 
The vector point layer contains the spatial location of the centres of randomly distributed sampling sites (Fig.  | Collection of Reference Data for Assessing the Accuracy of a Thematic Map: One of the major challenges of map evaluation is to obtain a reliable reference dataset with minimal positional errors and with the same date as the LUC maps. The aim is to obtain a data subset that faithfully represents the population from which it was extracted, so as to obtain confident accuracy estimates  | MapAccurAssess plugin: The collection of reference data requires the prior definition of several aspects relating to the size of the sampling area and the characteristics of the information we want to obtain 
The reference source can be either observed field data or data interpreted from satellite imagery and aerial photographs. Although data collected in the field is always preferable, this method is much more expensive, and the interpretation of aerial photographs and satellite images is often regarded as an acceptable alternative. In this case, it is important to ensure that the reference data has a higher quality and resolution than the images used in the initial mapping process. The labelling protocol should be the same as that used in the mapping, i.e. the land-cover classes or types of change, and the photointerpretation criteria for labelling the sampling sites should be the same as those used when drawing the map being assessed.
When the reference data are obtained from satellite imagery, there is a degree of uncertainty associated with the level of expertise of the photointerpreter. This uncertainty can be reduced if classification criteria are established before obtaining the reference data. To minimize interpreter bias, we suggest that at least two specialists perform the class assignment independently. When different labels are assigned to the same sampling unit, a third interpreter must decide which class it should be assigned to.
It is also necessary to establish the criteria for dealing with non-ideal situations. When the spatial reference unit, defined as a set of pixels, contains several different land-cover classes we suggest, when possible, assigning the reference unit to the majority category, representing more than 50% of the area. Another complex situation could be when the reference unit contains a linear feature or corridor which is assigned to several different land-cover classes. In this case, we suggest moving the sampling site to another place in which there is less uncertainty regarding class allocation. The producer and the person(s) assessing the map should always reach agreement on such decisions and document them, so as to avoid biases in the accuracy assessment. | QGIS Exercise: To collect reference data: This exercise is a guide to collecting reference data. Instead of fieldwork, high-resolution satellite imagery, available on Google Earth, is used together with various QGIS tools. The result of this exercise is a set of comparisons of land-cover observation taken from the high-resolution image (reference data) and the land-covers extracted from the LUC map under evaluation. The output data are formatted to compute the error matrix and accuracy statistics. These calculations are explained in Part III of this book (Sect. 5 in chapter ""Metrics Based on a Cross-Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"").
Available tools
The Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin (SCP) and the AcATaMa plugin have a module for the collection of reference data. AcATaMa provides a multi-view interface that allows spatial units to be added and revised in an orderly manner. However, spatial units can only be one pixel in size. For its part, the process for collecting the reference data using SCP is very similar to the process that would be followed if just QGIS tools were used. Notwithstanding, as SCP uses a unique data format (.scp), it is quite complicated to add other types of data or to use information from other platforms.
Both plugins have valuable tools that assist in the capture of reference data. However, as we intend to use larger spatial units than one pixel and wish to keep the installation of new interfaces and formats to a minimum, we will only use the basic QGIS (Buffer) tools, and other data services such as the Google Earth Engine Data catalog and QuickMapServices. | Materials: Centroids of sample sites-Marqu√©s de Comillas (the point vector layer RandomSample.shp created in the previous exercise that contain the centres of the sample sites) | Execution: Step 1
Before data collection can begin, the size and shape of the spatial unit must be established, i.e. the area over which we will be making the comparison between the thematic map values and the reference values. The minimum mappable area of the thematic map to be used in this exercise is 1 ha, and it is generally recommended that the spatial unit should be of a similar size. Accordingly, in this exercise, we will be using square polygons of 1 ha as the spatial unit.
The point layer containing the centroids (Centroids of sample sites-Marqu√©s de Comillas) will be used to create the spatial assessment units. To form square polygons centred on each of the points in the point layer, use first the Buffer tool in the Geoprocessing Tools menu. The input will be the point layer, and the distance value depends on the desired size of the square. In this case, 50 m. Change the End cap style to ""Square"" and leave the rest of the parameters unchanged (Fig. 
The newly created layer will have two attributes: the id and the value of the thematic class (inherited from the previous exercise). To avoid bias in the photointerpretation decision-making process, we advise hiding the class column (the value of the thematic class taken from the LUC map). To hide a column in the attribute table without deleting it definitively, right-click on the area of the attribute table headers, select the option Organize Columns, and then select the columns to hide (Fig. 
Step 2
Ideally, to identify the land-cover type of each sampling unit, it would be necessary to overlay them on high spatial resolution images with the same (or similar) date as the images used in the mapping. If such data are available, photointerpretation of the spatial units can proceed directly. However, acquiring high-resolution images to verify extensive areas could be expensive. In this regard, sometimes the resources are limited, which restricts the use of this source of imagery.
In the following steps, we propose a partial solution to this problem based on the combined use of image servers (Google Earth, Bing, ESRI) with high spatial and temporal resolution. However, in these servers it is impossible to identify and select scenes according to their acquisition dates. One way to estimate the dates of these data is to compare them with images with higher temporal resolution, which have a known acquisition time, and for which a longer Sample Data for Thematic Accuracy Assessment in QGIS historical record is available, such as Sentinel or Landsat images. For this purpose, we will install two plugins with which we can access the high spatial resolution image servers of Google, Bing and ESRI (QuickMapServices) and Sentinel, Landsat, Aster and other images (Google Earth Engine Data Catalog). To see how to install these plugins in QGIS, see Chapter ""About This Book"".
Step 3
Once QuickMapServices is installed, open the plugin and select Setting. Then select the More Services tab and click on the Get contributed pack. To add images with high spatial resolution to the QGIS Project, in the Web option in the main menu select QuickMapService, then Google and finally Google Satellite. After selecting these options, the Google Satellite images become available in the Layers menu.
Step 4
Add Sentinel-2 images from the Google Earth Engine Data Catalog plugin. The plugin requires to define the product type, date and cloud cover percentage (Fig. 
Step 5
To facilitate the collection of reference data, we suggest creating multiple windows to display images with different dates or resolutions, a good way to work when assessing land-cover change maps.
In the Layers panel, select the Image and vector layer (Centroids of sample sites-Marqu√©s de Comillas) that will be added to the second window, click on ""Manage Maps Themes"" button (represented as an eye) and select ""Add Theme"". Name the theme ""Image 1"". Then go to ""View"" in the main menu, and select ""New Map View"". This will create a new display window. Enter the new window and do the following: (a) Select the layers set to display (Image 1) by clicking on the on ""Manage Maps Themes""; (b) Synchronise the windows by selecting the ""view settings"" tool, and then click on the ""Synchronise scale"" option. The example in Fig. 
Step 6
To capture the reference data, the ""Centroids of sample sites -Marqu√©s de Comillas"" vector layer must be edited and a new field (integer type) must be added. We suggest naming it ""Refer_data"". Step 7
To make reference data collection easier, we recommend displaying the Attribute Table as a form and anchoring it to the main window, displaying only the selected data. To do this, open the Attribute Table, select the ""Dock Attribute Table "" icon, select the ""switch to form view"" button and then ""show Selected Feature"" (Fig. 
Step 8
If you have completed Steps 1-8 successfully, you can now start photointerpreting high-resolution satellite images. The exercise involves identifying the predominant land-cover type in each sampling unit and recording the corresponding code in the ""Refer_data"" column of the attribute table (Fig. 
Photointerpreting all the spatial units of the sample can be a lengthy process, so we suggest that you try to photointerpret at least 10 to 20 spatial units and then compare your results with the ""Photo-interpreted reference dataset-Marqu√©s de Comillas 2019"", a reference dataset was prepared by the authors. It is available, together with all book's data, at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5418318. For more information, see Chapter ""About This Book"". | Results and Comments: The result of this exercise should be a shapefile with an attribute table in which the columns class (map class code) and refer-data (photointerpreted class code) are filled in, as shown in Fig. 
It is worth remembering that in the absence of high spatial resolution imagery, medium resolution imagery, such as Landsat or Sentinel, can provide sufficient information to validate maps, especially small-scale maps.
Although the spatial assessment unit used in this exercise is widely used and recommended, it may contain several land-cover types. This means that clear rules should be established when deciding the category to which the unit should be allocated in these circumstances. | References: Cochran 
In this chapter, we describe the fundamental principles and the normal procedure followed when cross-tabulating two datasets. Cross-Tabulation analysis (Sect. 1) is usually the first step in the validation of Land Use Cover (LUC) data. It compares two datasets to observe their spatial relationship, i.e. their degree of spatial (dis) agreement. Results are usually displayed in the form of maps, tables and other statistical measures. Multiple-Resolution Cross-Tabulation (Sect. 2) compares two raster datasets at multiple spatial resolutions. Basic Cross-Tabulation can compare raster and vector data, while Multiple-Resolution Cross-Tabulation only works with raster data, which is what we use in the exercises provided as examples. In the exercises, raster data were obtained from vector data previously rasterized at different spatial resolutions. As a reference we use LUC maps, although ground points could also be used as reference data for these analyses. Examples of Cross-Tabulation analyses at one and multiple resolutions are presented for four different cases: to validate single LUC maps, to validate the soft maps produced by a model, to validate a simulation exercise and to validate and study land change in a series of LUC maps. In the example exercises, we used CORINE and SIOSE maps from the Asturias Central Area database, as well as maps from the modelling exercises carried out with this database. In the Chapters ""Metrics Based on a Cross-Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"" and ""Pontius Jr. Methods Based on a Cross-Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"", we focus on specific analyses that can be carried out on the basis of Cross-Tabulation analyses, such as Land Use Cover Changes (LUCC) Budget or Quantity and Allocation disagreement. These help unleash the full potential of Cross-Tabulation analysis. | Keywords: Cross-Tabulation √Å Multiple-Resolution √Å Land Use Cover data √Å Validation 1 Basic Cross-Tabulation Description Cross-Tabulation is a primary analysis that crosses two datasets, either raster or vector, to analyse their spatial relation. This analysis combines the datasets in spatial terms. It produces a map or table that shows how the values of one dataset spatially relate with the values in the other, thereby informing us as to whether the two datasets share the same values at a given location and, if not, with which other values they have established a relation. | Utility: Exercises 1. To validate a map against reference data/map 2. To validate soft maps produced by the model against a reference map 3. To validate a simulation against a reference map 4. To validate a series of maps with two or more time points
Starting with a map and some reference data, we can use Cross-Tabulation to determine to what extent the map we want to validate agrees with the reference data. In this way we can compare the success of a LUC classification exercise or a LUCC modelling exercise against reference data. We can also assess how uncertain a map is with regard to the data used as a reference. Cross-Tabulation can also be used to study the LUC changes between pairs of maps at two or more different points in time, or to validate a chronological series of maps, as it can detect unusual or abnormal changes, which could be due to technical errors.
The Cross-Tabulation matrix provides users with a lot of information from the maps in one single analysis. However, in order to take advantage of the full potential of this analysis, it is important for them to understand what all this information means. This is what we will be explaining in this chapter.
The results of Cross-Tabulation can then be used to make further analyses and to extract other metrics that allow us to take full advantage of this basic analysis. These methods (e.g. LUCC budget, Quantity & Allocation disagreement, the Figure of Merit, Intensity Analysis) (see Sects. 2, 3, 4 and 6 in Chapter ""Pontius Jr. Methods Based on a Cross-Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") make it easier for users to interpret the results. However, they also require many further analyses and are therefore more time-consuming. We will now provide an overview of some relevant examples: The maps to be compared or assessed may be in either raster or vector format. For those in raster, we can use both hard and soft maps, such as suitability, transition potential and probabilities maps. | QGIS Exercises: The methods and techniques presented in Chapter ""Pontius Jr. Methods Based on a Cross-Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"" (e.g. LUCC Budget, Intensity Analysis, Quantity and Allocation disagreement‚Ä¶) are based on this basic Cross-Tabulation analysis. In this chapter, we will therefore only be describing the fundamental principles and the normal procedure followed when performing a Cross-Tabulation between two datasets. QGIS includes many tools for cross-tabulating spatial data through the associated GRASS and SAGA models. The ""Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin"" also includes tools to cross-tabulate datasets for different purposes.
Table 
The associated R software can also be used to cross-tabulate pairs of maps. This is done using the crosstab function, which is part of the ""raster"" package. 
Of all the tools available in QGIS, the one we will be recommending and using in this book is the ""Semi-Automatic  | Requisites: The two maps must have the same extent, spatial resolution, projection and classification legend. If the maps have different classification legends, the user must reclassify the maps in such a way as to unify the two legends. | Execution: Step 1
Open the ""Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin"" and select the ""Postprocessing"" tab from the sidebar. Then click on Accuracy and select the required parameters: raster to assess (CORINE map) and reference raster (SIOSE map) (Fig.  | Results and Comments: Once the function has been executed, QGIS creates an output raster that gives each pixel a code. This code identifies every single possible combination of values between the two input rasters. The meaning of each code is presented in a table in CSV format, which is stored in the same folder as the raster. This information is also displayed in the ""output"" window of the ""Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin"" (Fig. 
If we analyse the first matrix shown in the ""output"" window (ErrMatrixCode/Reference/Classified/PixelSum), it will help us understand the meaning of the codes in the raster. The ""ErrMatrixCode"" is the number that identifies each pixel in the new raster. ""Reference"" is the code for the category on the reference map (i.e. SIOSE Land Use Map). ""Classified"" is the code for the category on the compared map (i.e. CORINE Land Use Map), and ""PixelSum"" refers to the number of pixels for each combination in the new raster.
The ErrMatrixCode 1 identifies 234,164 pixels (Pix-elSum) in category 0 in SIOSE (Reference) and 0 in COR-INE (Classified). The codes for combinations in which the reference and the classified categories are the same (e.g. 0, 0) mean agreement, while those in which the reference and the classified categories are different (e.g. 0, 1) mean disagreement. Code 2 is therefore a disagreement area because the pixel is classified as 0 in SIOSE and as 1 in CORINE.
If we symbolize the obtained raster in such a way that all the codes that refer to combinations of the same classes 
With the obtained raster, we can for example represent where the urban fabric of CORINE ( 
To do so, we must first identify the codes (ErrMa-trixCode) for the combinations we are looking for, i.e. pixels which are urban fabric in CORINE (Classified is 2) and which belong to any other category in SIOSE (Reference is not 2). These are codes 
In addition to the map, the accuracy analysis of the ""Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin"" also generates two error/Cross-Tabulation matrixes, one in cells and the other in square meters (area proportions). The matrix in cells (Fig. 
An analysis of the two tables (area-based error matrix and error matrix pixel count) offers us a detailed picture of how the categories on one map relate with the categories on the other. This highlights the degree of agreement between the reference map and the one we are trying to validate. In both tables, the combinations in which there is agreement can be seen on a diagonal line running across the table. All combinations outside this diagonal mean disagreement (Table 
If we look at urban fabric, of a total of 28,110 pixels labelled as urban fabric in CORINE (Total column on the right), 19,455 are also labelled as urban fabric in SIOSE. That is, almost 70% of the pixels identified as urban fabric by CORINE are also considered urban fabric in SIOSE. In the other 30%, CORINE mostly confuses urban fabric with industrial and commercial areas (category 3, 2244 confused pixels), artificial green urban areas (category 9, 1643 confused pixels) and road and rail networks (category 6, 1216 confused pixels).
These results are due to the greater degree of generalization when mapping CORINE, as explained above. On the basis of these results and taking SIOSE as a reference, we can conclude that CORINE maps urban fabric correctly and can be considered a valid map for our exercises.
Users can also carry out more complex analyses with these matrixes using the CSV file generated by the tool. In this way   the matrixes can be imported in spreadsheet format with software such as Excel or OpenOffice Calc. We can then calculate the agreement and disagreement percentages for the whole raster or for each of the categories under consideration, as we did manually for the urban fabric above. The error matrixes also provide useful statistical measures (Fig. 
Exercise 2. To validate soft maps produced by the model against a reference map Aim To find out whether the urban fabric soft map produced by our model agrees with the urban fabric areas of the reference map for the year of the simulation. | Materials:  | CORINE Land Use Map Asturias Central Area 2011 Urban fabric suitability map -CORINE model:  | Requisites: The two maps must have the same extent, spatial resolution and projection. The soft map must be categorical. The Land Use map must only contain information about the category being assessed. For a proper validation, the reference map must refer to the same date on which the landscape was simulated. | Execution: Step 1
Only discrete or categorical maps can be cross-tabulated. As the soft map we want to validate is continuous (continuous values from 0.1 to 1), the first step must be to convert it into a categorical map, using the Reclassify by table function (Processing toolbox > Raster analysis > Reclassify by table).
After opening this tool, we select the map we want to reclassify (Urban fabric suitability map) and fill in the ""Reclassification table"" with the new values that will be replacing the old ones in the raster (Fig. 
Step 2
Given that our objective is to compare the suitability values for urban fabric in the model with the areas classified as urban fabric on the 2011 map, we must ignore all the other categories on the Land Use Cover map. We must therefore obtain a binary map from the initial CORINE map. In this binary map, 1 will mean the category being evaluated (urban fabric) and 0 all the others.
To obtain this binary map, we repeat the same process as in Step 1. In this case, we reclassify the CORINE map, assigning a value of 1 to urban fabric (code 2 in the original map) and a value of 0 to the other categories (codes 0, 
Step 3
Once we have obtained the two maps, we then carry out Cross-Tabulation using the ""Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin"". We click on the ""Postprocessing"" tab and select the Cross classification option.
We then select the required parameters. In ""Select the classification"" we choose the reference Land Use Cover map obtained after reclassification (Step 2). In ""Select the reference vector or raster"" we choose the soft map obtained after reclassification (Step 1) (Fig.  | Results and Comments: Once the function has been executed, QGIS creates a raster and a CSV file with all the results of the Cross-Tabulation. These are also displayed in the ""Output"" window (Fig. 
The first table provides information about the meaning of each code in the new raster. Pixels with value 2 refer to areas that are urban fabric (Classification is 1) and have a suitability of less than 0.2 (Reference category is 1). This combination occurs in just 2 pixels (PixelSum), which represent an area of 5000 m 2 on the map (Area [metre 2 ]).
The second table gives an overview of the possible combinations on the two maps and the area, in square meters, covered by these combinations. This shows that the areas that are not urban fabric (Classification is 0.0) and have a suitability of below 0.25 (Reference 1) occupy 2,312,499 m 2 .
From all the possible combinations, we can see that most of the pixels that are urban fabric on the reference map fit with the areas with the highest suitability to become urban fabric (26,137 pixels, 65,342,474 m 2 ). There are relatively few urban fabric pixels with a suitability of between 0.5 and 0.75 (1971 pixels, 4,927,498 m 2 ) and an insignificant number with a suitability of less than 0.5.
These results indicate that our suitability map has been validated. In other words, the high suitability values on the soft map correspond with urban fabric areas on the reference map. For their part, the low suitability values correspond to areas where there is no urban fabric on the map. This means that when we use this map in our simulation, it will help us to correctly identify those areas that can become urban in the future and those that cannot.
Other more sophisticated tools, such as the ROC curve and the Difference in Potential (see Sects. 2 and 3 in Chapter ""Validation of Soft Maps Produced by a Land Use Cover Change Model""), can be used to complement this analysis and offer the user a full overview of the validity of their potential maps.   | Requisites: The two maps must have the same extent, spatial resolution, projection and legend. For a proper validation, the reference date must refer to the date on which the landscape was simulated.  | Execution: Step 1
Open the ""Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin"", click on the ""Postprocessing"" tab and select the section Accuracy. Then, select the required parameters: raster to assess (Simulation) and reference raster (CORINE reference map) (Fig.  | Results and Comments: When we execute the function, QGIS creates an output raster showing the combination of classes between the two input maps. The function generates three tables in the ""output window"", which are also stored in CSV format in the same folder as the raster. They specify the meaning of each code in the new raster. They also include a couple of error/Cross-Tabulation matrixes, in cells and in square meters (proportional quantities) (Fig. 
If we symbolize the raster and focus on the information in the Cross-Tabulation matrix of most interest for assessing our simulation, we can understand the errors we made in our modelling exercise in greater detail.
In our exercise we only actively modelled two categories: urban fabric and industrial areas. In the raster we can identify the simulated areas that show agreement (or disagreement) with the reference map for each of these two categories. To do this, the first step is to identify the code for the combinations involving the two categories being considered: urban fabric ( 
The combination codes for urban fabric are 3, 16, 29, 42, 81, and 120, while code 29 represents the areas that were simulated as urban fabric (Classified is 2) and also appear as urban fabric on the reference map (Reference is 2). The combination codes for industrial and commercial areas are 4, 17, 30, 43, and 82, while code 43 represents the pixels that are industrial and commercial areas in both the simulation and the reference map.
If we symbolize the raster obtained using these codes in terms of agreement (codes 29 and 43) and disagreement (all the other codes mentioned above), we can visualize the pattern of error in our simulations compared to the map we use as a reference (Fig. 
Most of the simulated areas agree with the reference map. Disagreement can only be observed in a few cases. However, this conclusion may be misleading. Most of the agreement refers to areas that were already urban fabric or industrial and commercial areas, i.e. areas that were correctly simulated as permanence.
Simulating permanence for artificial surfaces is very easy. A high rate of success is expected in all cases. If we focus on the areas that actually changed during the simulation period in relation to the reference map and those that were simulated as change, we can detect a higher proportion of errors. However, this cannot be detected on our map. In order to focus on these errors, we should only cross-tabulate the changes in the simulation with respect to the initial map 
Once again, whereas most of the agreement refers to areas that were already urban fabric in the past and were correctly simulated as persistence, confusion seems to refer above all to areas that were not correctly simulated. That is, agricultural and vegetation areas where new urban fabric was simulated but which, according to the reference map, did not actually undergo any change. We therefore need to repeat the analysis, focusing only on the areas that actually change so as to assess the success of our simulation more effectively.
Other tools, such as the Figure of Merit (see Sect. 4 in Chapter ""Pontius Jr. Methods Based on a Cross-Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps""), can also be useful to help validate the simulation and overcome some of the limitations we have encountered.  | Requisites: The two maps must be raster and must have the same extent, spatial resolution, projection and classification legend. If the maps have different classification legends, the user must reclassify the maps in such a way as to unify the two legends. The maps must refer to two different points in time. | Execution: Step 1
The first step is to obtain a raster for the whole study area, showing the areas that changed during the study period and those that remained the same.
To get this map, open the ""Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin"", click on the ""Postprocessing"" tab and then select Land cover change. Then, complete the required parameters, selecting the older map as the reference classification 
Step 2
To obtain a map that only shows the areas that changed during the study period, we must repeat the same operation, this time leaving the ""Report unchanged pixels"" option unmarked (Fig.  | Results and Comments: After executing Steps 1 and 2, QGIS creates two output rasters, one showing changes and permanent areas (Fig. 
The function also generates a table for each map in the ""output"" window and stored in CSV format. This table shows each possible combination and the code with which it is represented in the output rasters (Fig. 
Both the rasters and the table can be used to understand the changes in our study area. The table shows those that took place during the study period (Table 
Of the various different transitions of agricultural areas, the one to urban fabric (from category 0 in 2005 to category 2 in 2011) is the most important with a total of 751 pixels. As regards the transitions in vegetation areas (category 1), the most common was the change from vegetation areas to agricultural areas (from category 1 in 2005 to category 0 in 2011), with a total of 588 pixels. This change in pixels (Table 
Most of the change in our area was between agricultural and vegetation areas and vice versa and from agricultural and vegetation areas to artificial surfaces. However, there were also various other interesting transitions, such as the conversion of water bodies into port areas (from category 11 to category 7), which affected a total of 657 pixels. This was due to the construction of a dock in Gij√≥n in the north of our study area.
By symbolizing the raster of changes (Fig. 
In the composition of the map in Fig. 
The map shows the changes for the example area of Gij√≥n. In the north, we can observe the new dock built in the port area. Apart from the port, most of the growth in industrial land took place in the south of the city. The same is true for urban fabric, with the construction of a new residential development in Roces. As can be seen on the map, this new residential area is cut off from the existing urban fabric of the city. There is a highway running between the two.
The results of this analysis can also be useful to validate a chronological series of maps. When interpreting the changes, it can help detect unrealistic changes that may be due to errors in the input data. We can also detect changes in the boundaries of the study area which cannot be fully represented on the maps because the study area has been clipped.
Other tools and techniques, such as LUCC budget or Quantity and Allocation disagreement, can also help characterize real changes in the study area and detect areas where no changes have taken place, despite being marked as change areas on the maps. In this way, these techniques can provide useful, complementary information on this question. However, users can compare the dataset at as many different resolutions as they deem fit. These must always be coarser than the original spatial resolution.
The concept of spatial resolution refers to the level of spatial detail available in the spatial data. It applies to data in raster format, where the spatial resolution is defined by the pixel size. This means that, unlike basic Cross-Tabulation, this analysis can only be performed with raster data. | Utility: Exercises 1. To validate a map against reference data/map 2. To validate soft maps produced by the model against a reference map 3. To validate a simulation against a reference map This technique aims to control the multiscale uncertainty of a validation exercise, which is not considered in basic Cross-Tabulation analyses. It can also be used to evaluate the uncertainty of a LUC classification exercise, a LUC map or a LUCC modelling exercise against reference data.
Maps that show a lot of disagreement at detailed scales can refer to the same information at coarser scales. This technique can therefore be used to discover at which spatial resolution a map is considered least uncertain according to the information provided by a reference map.
This analysis can be used as a complement to fuzzy logic tools 
Multiple-Resolution Cross-Tabulation can only be carried out with raster data. However, we can make the comparison with either hard-or soft-classified raster maps, such as suitability, transition potential or probabilities maps. In the last case, we must always reclassify the soft-classified raster maps in a set of categories. It is not possible to cross-tabulate rasters with a continuous range of values.
As in the case of basic Cross-Tabulation, if we want to explore the full potential of the results of these analyses, we can use other complementary metrics such as Land Use Cover Change budget (LUCC budget, see Sect. In addition to the basic Multiple-Resolution Cross-Tabulation presented in this section, some more sophisticated variants have been proposed by other authors. These include:
‚Ä¢ Costanza (1989), who proposed a method to determine the goodness of fit between model output and spatial and/or time series data based on the idea that the measurements at one resolution are not sufficient to describe more complex patterns. In his method, an expanding window is used to gradually degrade the resolution of the data, establishing, among the lack of fit, situations of ""registration"", ""resolution"" and residual components.  | QGIS Exercises: Available tools QGIS does not include a tool to cross-tabulate maps at multiple resolutions. To carry out this analysis, it is therefore necessary to combine raster resampling tools with the basic Cross-Tabulation tools. For detailed information of the tools available in QGIS for performing Cross-Tabulation, please refer to Sect. 1.
Various different tools can be used to resample raster maps in QGIS. The GRASS module provides a tool (r.resample) for resampling the raster according to the Nearest Neighbour method. The GDAL module provides a tool to reproject rasters (Warp (reproject)) that also enables resampling through different methods, including the Nearest Neighbour. For its part, the SAGA toolbox provides a tool for resampling rasters with similar options. In addition, the QGIS interface allows the user to resample maps by making a copy of a displayed map via the option ""Save raster layer as‚Ä¶"" (Layer > Save as).
For categorical maps such as Land Use Cover maps, two resampling strategies are usually applied: Nearest Neighbour and Majority Rule. We decided to apply Nearest Neighbour because this is the method that best preserves the landscape composition and configuration or in other words, the proportions of the different categories and their patterns.
The four resampling tools available in QGIS are all equally valid. In this case we decided to use the tool that becomes available when making a copy of an existing raster (Save as‚Ä¶) because of its simplicity and efficiency. Nevertheless, users must be aware that the resampled rasters will vary slightly depending on the method chosen, and are therefore not fully comparable. Once a method or tool has been selected, all the resampling procedures must be performed using this same method or tool.  | Requisites: The two maps must have the same extent, projection and classification legend. If the maps have different classification legends, the user must reclassify the maps in such a way as to unify the two legends. | Execution: Step 1
Given that to carry out Cross-Tabulation at multiple resolutions we need to have maps in raster format, the first thing we have to do is rasterize our vector maps. If you would like to perform this analysis by resampling original raster maps, please refer to Exercise 2 Step 1.
We are going to convert our original vector file to raster at four different spatial resolutions: 25, 50, 75 and 100 m. Our analysis will be based on the same four spatial resolutions.
To rasterize vector data, we use the Rasterize (Vector to raster) tool. Once inside this tool, we begin by indicating the vector layer we want to rasterize (SIOSE 2011 map). Then, we go to ""Field to use for burn-in value [optional]"" where we indicate the field in the attribute table of the vector layer that will give the raster the pixel values (Metro) (Fig. 
We must also set the spatial resolution for the raster we want to create. To do this, we must first define the units for the spatial resolution in the ""Output raster size unit"" option (Georeferenced Units). Then, we choose the spatial resolution or pixel size through the ""Width/Horizontal resolution"" (25) and ""Height/Vertical resolution"" options (25). We must also specify the extent of the raster that will be created in the option ""Output extent (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)"". We are going to use the extent of the layer we are rasterizing (SIOSE 2011) through the submenu on the right (Use layer extent‚Ä¶).
The final stage is to assign a value to the background, i.e. the pixels that are not covered by any polygon in the vector file. Given that the vector already has values from 0 to 11, we will define the background with code 12. We do this via the option ""Pre-initiate the output image with value [optional]"", available under the ""Advanced parameters"" options (Fig. 
Our background value (12) will also be the nodata value of our raster. We can assign a nodata value for the raster we are going to create using the option ""Assign a specified nodata value to output bands [optional]"" (Fig. 
Once we have finished the first rasterization, we must repeat the same procedure for the other three spatial resolutions that we need for the SIOSE dataset. Then, we must repeat the whole workflow for the CORINE map. Once all these tasks have been completed, we will have 8 different maps (4 SIOSE and 4 CORINE) at 4 different spatial resolutions (25, 50, 75 and 100 m).
Step 3 Once all the maps have been created, we can start the Cross-Tabulation. To do this, open the ""Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin"", click on the ""Postprocessing"" tab and select Cross Classification. Then, select the required parameters: raster to assess (CORINE map 25 m) and reference raster (SIOSE map 25 m) (Fig. 
Step 4
After the first execution, repeat this process with the other pair of maps (one for CORINE and one for SIOSE) at different spatial resolutions. | Results and Comments: Once we have executed the function four times, QGIS will create an output map for each execution with the combined classes and an error/Cross-Tabulation matrix. These will be stored in the folder we selected earlier when executing the tool. Matrixes are also displayed in the ""output"" window. For a detailed description of each of these results, please refer to the Sect. 1.
If we compare the results of each of the error matrixes, we can see that there are few differences between them. Error matrixes show the area in square meters covered by each possible combination between classes. The combination that covers most area is always the agreement between agricultural areas: pixels that are 0 (agricultural areas) in both the validated (CORINE) and the reference (SIOSE) maps. At a spatial resolution of 25 m, these areas occupy 585,267,500 m 2 ; at 50 m, 585,225,000 m 2 ; at 75 m, 585,815,625 m 2 ; and at 100 m, 584,660,000 m 2 . The differences are therefore very small.
A similar pattern can be observed if we look at the rest of the combinations. This means that at all the spatial resolutions there are very similar levels of agreement and disagreement between the classes on the two maps (CORINE and SIOSE). We can therefore conclude that the spatial resolution selected to make the analysis has no substantial effect on the results.
That means that the areas classified differently on the two maps are not due to small details drawn on one map that do not appear on the other. Disagreement is not the result of isolated pixels on one map that are not classified in the same category on the other. If this were true, the agreement between the two maps should be higher at coarser resolutions because they are more generalized, so ruling out minor details.
In conclusion, it would seem that the differences between the two maps are structural. In other words, they are not caused by the spatial resolution or level of detail of the maps, and instead result from the fact that each map represents a different reality on the ground. If we generalize both maps and rule out all small details, both maps show a similar level of agreement. Notwithstanding this, we must always remember that most of the areas in both maps agree, as confirmed in the Sect. 1.
When compared with SIOSE, CORINE can be considered a valid map because the agreement between the two is very high. The differences between them are the same regardless of the spatial resolution employed to make the analysis, at least within the resolution range we used (from 25 to 100 m). Thus, although the differences between SIOSE and CORINE are the result of their different scale and Minimum Mapping Unit, they cannot be eliminated simply by generalizing the maps using coarser spatial resolutions. In fact, their agreements and disagreements remain the same, which suggests that the different scale of production introduces important structural differences in the way the two maps draw the ground land uses and land covers. | Exercise 2. To validate soft maps produced by the model against a reference map:  | Aim: To evaluate to what extent the urban fabric suitability map of our model agrees with the urban fabric areas of the reference map for the year of the simulation at multiple spatial resolutions, determining the resolution at which there is most agreement. | Materials:  | CORINE Land Use Map Asturias Central Area 2011 Urban fabric suitability map-CORINE model:  | Requisites: The two maps must have the same extent, spatial resolution and projection. The soft map must be a categorical map. The Land Use map must only contain information about the category being assessed. For a proper validation, the reference map must refer to the same date as the simulation.  | Execution: Step 1
We begin by converting our soft map into a categorical one to comply with the requirements of the Cross-Tabulation tool. This is done using the Reclassify by table function (Processing toolbox > Raster analysis > Reclassify by table).
There are no standard criteria for the reclassification of soft maps and users can apply whatever thresholds they think best. In this case, we will use the same thresholds we used in Exercise 2 of the Sect. 1. We will therefore reclassify the map into four new categories: 1 (suitability 0-0.25), 2 (0.25-0.50), 3 (0.50-0.75) and 4 (0.75-1).
Step 2
As stated in the requisites, we will cross-tabulate the reclassified soft map with a map that only shows the Land Use Cover category of interest, i.e. urban fabric. To this end, we must extract the urban fabric areas from the LUC map (CORINE) using the same function as in Step 1 (Reclassify by table). In the reclassification, we will assign a value of 1 to urban fabric (code 2 in the original map) and a value of 0 to the other categories (codes 0, 
Step 3
Once we have the two maps, we can then resample them at different spatial resolutions to carry out the Multiple-ResolutionCross-Tabulation. In our case, as the original pixel size is 50 m, we will resample our maps at 75, 100, 125 and 150 m using the Save As‚Ä¶tool. In this tool, we need to indicate the name of the map we are going to resample (the reclassified suitability map of urban fabric) and the spatial resolution at which we will resample the maps (Fig. 
Once we have obtained all the maps we need, we can then carry out the Cross-Tabulation exercise using the Cross classification tool from the ""Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin"". Once inside the tool, we must indicate the two rasters that we want to cross-tabulate: the soft map (Select the classification) and the land use map for the category of interest (Select the reference vector or raster) (Fig. 
Step 6
After we do this for the maps at the original resolution (50 m), we repeat the process at the other 4 spatial resolutions (75, 100, 125 and 150 m). | Results and Comments: After executing the function for each pair of maps at each spatial resolution, the tool produces (for each spatial resolution) an output map with the combination and two matrixes detailing how the values of both maps cross-tabulate. These are stored in the folder we selected and are also displayed on the screen (Output tab). For a detailed description of each of these results, please refer to the Sect. 1.
""The ""Cross Matrix"" is the most interesting of all these results in that it provides us with all the information we need for our analysis. It details how much of the area for each category in the reclassified suitability map falls inside areas that are urban fabric in our reference maps (Tables 
For the analysis at a spatial resolution of 50 m, there are 4999 m 2 of low suitability (suitability below 0.25) that cross-tabulate with areas that are urban fabric in the  reference LUC map. If we consider that each pixel represents an area of 2500 m 2 (50 m √Ç 50 m), this means that only 2 pixels of urban fabric cross-tabulate with areas of low suitability on the suitability map. 1971 pixels with medium to high suitability (0.5-0.75) cross-tabulate with areas that are urban fabric. Finally, most of the urban fabric pixels cross-tabulate with areas with the highest suitability (0.75-1): this combination is represented by 26,137 pixels. These data show that there is a positive correlation between suitability and the presence of urban fabric. We can therefore conclude that suitability is a good driver for our model.
Varying the spatial resolution of the analysis did not lead to any major differences in the correlation between the suitability map and the urban fabric areas in the reference maps. At the five spatial resolutions assessed, most of the pixels fell within the highest suitability category 
The dissimilarities between the analyses at different resolutions were very small. At 75 m, just two pixels fell within the areas of lowest suitability (11,245 m 2 ). At 100 m, there were a lot more: 74 pixels (738,436 m 2 ). At 125 m there was just 1 pixel (15,651 m 2 ), and at 150 m, no pixels at all (0 m 2 ). Similar behaviour can be observed for the other two categories of suitability at all five resolutions. This indicates that the suitability map for urban fabric in our modelling exercise is correct. It positively correlates with those areas that are urban fabric in our reference map, so helping us to identify the areas in which new urban fabric is most likely to appear. However, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the best spatial resolution at which to carry out the modelling exercise. As the explanatory power of the suitability maps is very similar at all the spatial resolutions assessed, the decision as to which spatial resolution would be best for our modelling exercise should be based on other factors, such as how realistic the pattern looks or what the minimum level of detail might be for the model to be useful for stakeholders and users.
This analysis could be complemented with more sophisticated tools like the ROC curve and the Difference in Potential (see Sects. 2 and 3 in Chapter ""Validation of Soft Maps Produced by a Land Use Cover Change Model""). These tools also provide information about how well a model soft map simulates a category of interest, such as urban fabric.
Exercise 3. To validate a simulation against a reference map | Aim: To validate a simulation for the year 2011 against a reference map for the same year at multiple spatial resolutions, determining the resolution at which both maps show the best agreement. | Materials: Simulation CORINE Asturias Central Area 2011 CORINE Land Use Map Asturias Central Area 2011 | Requisites: The two maps must have the same extent, spatial resolution, projection and legend. For proper validation, the reference date must refer to the date on which the landscape was simulated. | Execution: Step 1
For Multiple-Resolution Cross-Tabulation, we need first to resample the original rasters (50 m) at other spatial resolutions. In this case, we will resample our simulation at 100, Step 2). Once inside the tool, we fill in the required parameters: name of the raster to be sampled (Simulation CORINE) and spatial resolution (100 m).
Step 2
Once we have resampled the first map, we then repeat the procedure for the other spatial resolutions (150 and 200 m) and for the reference map. By the end, we should have 8 maps (4 simulations and 4 reference maps) at 4 spatial resolutions (50, 100, 150 and 200 m).
Step 3
With all these resampled maps, we can then carry out the Cross-Tabulation exercise at multiple resolutions. To do this, open the ""Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin"", click on the ""Postprocessing"" tab and select Accuracy. Fill in the required parameters: raster to assess (Simulation CORINE 11 map at 50 m) and reference raster (CORINE 11 map at 50 m) (Fig. 
Step 4
Repeat the same procedure for the other pairs of maps at 100, 150 and 200 m. | Results and Comments: After this function has been executed for each spatial resolution, QGIS will create an output map, a couple of matrixes and some statistical measures. All the tables and statistics can be consulted in the ""output window"" and all the results will be saved in the folder we selected earlier. For a detailed description of each of these results, please refer to the Sect. 1. The analysis of the matrixes at the different spatial resolutions shows no important differences between resolutions, and very similar results in all cases. In general, there is a high level of agreement between the simulation and the reference map, as studied above in the Sect. 1 when conducting the analysis at the original resolution of the modelling exercise.
If we take Overall Accuracy as a summary metric describing the similarity between the two maps, we can see that similarity is very high in all cases (Table 
We must also bear in mind the limitations for this exercise mentioned in the Sect. 1. Validating a simulation by cross-tabulating the simulated exercise with a reference map may be misleading. Most of the areas in both maps agree The best way to validate the changes modelled in our exercise is to focus exclusively on the simulated changes and on a map of reference showing the changes on the ground. In this case, the Multiple-Resolution exercise could provide very interesting insights, as agreement between simulated and reference changes may be higher at coarser spatial resolutions.

The overlaying of two map layers is a standard GIS procedure. As we saw in the previous chapter, it enables us to compute the intersection between two feature classes and cross-tabulate either the area or the pixel count of the intersecting features depending on whether raster or vector data are being used. Cross-tabulation can be used to evaluate different topics depending on the nature of the input data. In this chapter, cross-tabulation is used to assess land cover changes, the spatial agreement between maps and map accuracy. In Sect. 1, Land use/cover changes (LUCC) are quantified by comparing two LUC maps, computing different indices of change and creating a change matrix. In Sect. 2, we used various metrics to evaluate the spatial agreement between two maps. This procedure was applied to compare a LUC map with a reference map, a simulated LUC map with a reference map and a simulated LUCC map with a reference map of changes. Section 3 introduces the Kappa indices, which allow us to assess the agreement between two datasets, given the agreement expected by random coincidence. We used the indices to compare observed or simulated maps with a reference map. In Sect. 4 we evaluate the agreement between maps at a global level (the entire map) by focusing on a specific feature such as a smaller area or a particular category (stratum level). Finally, in Sect. where A 1 and A 2 are the category areas in question at dates 1 and 2, respectively. AC can be divided by the number of years between the two dates to obtain the average annual change area over the study period.
Relative change (RC) is obtained by normalizing the absolute change value by the category area at date 1.
This formula expresses the proportion of the category area that changed over the study period.
Other indices of LUCC include rates of change. The most popular rate of change is the annual rate of deforestation proposed by the 
An alternative equation, also based on the compound interest law, was proposed by 
Both formulae give similar results except when LUCC is very high, in which case r is significantly higher than t 
All the change indices presented above indicate net change, which results from the balance after gross losses have been subtracted from gross gains. For instance, a given forest category could show an absolute change of -2 ha, which could be erroneously interpreted as very little change, but in fact is the result of two opposing processes: the deforestation of 202 ha compensated by the reforestation of 200 ha. A more detailed analysis of change dynamics can be obtained by cross-tabulating the two maps at two different dates and drawing up a change matrix. The change matrix is a cross-tabulated table indicating the area covered by each change (or permanence) between a category at date 1 and another category at date 2. Many change indices can be obtained from this matrix (see, for example, Sect. 2).  | Utility:  | QGIS Exercise: Available tools
The indices of change proposed in this document are based on the area statistics for the two maps. These could be efficiently computed using a spreadsheet program. However, we suggest using a simple R script using the QGIS Processing R provider plugin. The script generates a table containing the absolute change (AC) area, the relative change (RC) area (both in hectares), the rates of change based on  | Requisites: All maps must be in raster format and have the same resolution, extent and projection. | Execution: If necessary, install the Processing R provider plugin and download the R script Change_Statistics.rsx into the R scripts folder (processing/rscripts). For more information, see Chapter ""About This Book"".
Step 1
Then, execute the script and fill in the required parameters (names and dates of the two maps and the output table) as shown in Fig. 
The script generates two tables in CSV format: a table showing the change indices (Table  | Results and Comments: The two land covers with the most significant absolute change are Categories 1 (built-up) and 2 (agriculture). During the period 2000-2018, the built-up area is increased by 1840 ha, and agriculture lost 1987 ha. The built-up area increased by over 50%. The rates of change resulting from the two equations are very similar. The two categories with the largest rates are built-up (Category 1) and water (Category 6) areas. Over the period 2000-2018, the area covered by these categories increased by around 2.5% a year. Categories 2 and 4 (agriculture and scrubs) present a negative net change rate, indicating that their areas have been shrinking. The change matrix gives us more information about the  processes of change. One surprising change is the transition from 1 (built-up) to 6 (water). On closer observation, it was found that pits had been filled with water to create reservoirs. | Areal and Spatial Agreement Metrics: Description Different authors have proposed a series of metrics that evaluate the areal and spatial agreement between two land use/cover maps or between any of their categories. These metrics are obtained from the cross-tabulation matrix and summarize in a single value the agreement between two maps.
The metrics are based either on the comparison of the proportion of total area occupied by a particular category on two maps or on the spatial coincidence of the pixels allocated to any given category on two maps. This review includes some of the most recently developed metrics. 
where X i refers to the number of pixels belonging to category i in map X, Y i refers to the number of pixels belonging to category i in map Y, XY ii refers to the number of pixels belonging to category i in both maps X and Y, N is the number of categories into which the pixels are classified and M is the number of pixels into which the maps are divided.
The overall spatial agreement (A 0 ) and the overall spatial inconsistency (OSI) metrics assess the spatial agreement between the categories in two maps. One metric can be obtained from the other. Whereas A 0 shows the spatial agreement (0-100%), the OSI shows the spatial disagreement (0-100%). Added together, they come to 100. 
where X i refers to the percentage of the total area represented by category i in map X, Y i refers to the percentage of the total area represented by category i in map Y, n is the total number of categories, N is the number of pixels and N i6 ¬ºj √∞ √û is the number of pixels assigned to one category in Map X and a different category in Map Y.
Overall areal inconsistency (OAI) shows the agreement between two maps in terms of category proportions and is expressed in values of between 0 and 100. Users can also assess the areal and spatial agreement/disagreement at a category level through the individual areal inconsistency (AIC) and individual spatial agreement (A i ) metrics. The values for the latter range from 0 to 100, and a value of 100 means perfect agreement.
AIC does not have a standard scale of values, as these depend on the proportion of the total area of the map allocated to the category. It is therefore very difficult to compare the values for this metric between classes, so limiting its usefulness. | Utility: Exercises 1. To validate a map against reference data/map 2. To validate a simulation against a reference map 3. To validate simulated changes against a reference map of changes
The areal and spatial agreement metrics assess the similarity between the two maps. They are obtained from the cross-tabulation matrix and therefore do not provide any additional information, in that the values they provide can also be obtained from the matrix. However, they are standard metrics that allow us to measure the agreement between two maps and summarize it in a single figure. In this sense, they are similar to the user's and producer's accuracy metrics and to Kappa indices. They are also complementary to quantity and allocation (dis)agreement metrics, as they can differentiate between spatial and quantity agreements. These metrics can be used to assess how similar a land use/cover map is to another map used as a reference, i.e. the real situation on the ground. They can also be used to check the similarity between a simulation and the reference map for the same year. | QGIS Exercises: Available tools QGIS has no specific tool for calculating the metrics proposed by 
Exercise 1. To validate a map against reference data/map Aim To validate the CORINE 2011 land use map, take the SIOSE 2011 land use map as a reference. We will be focusing particularly on how the ""urban fabric"" and ""industrial and commercial areas"" categories are mapped in CORINE 2011. | Materials:  | CORINE Land Use Map Asturias Central Area 2011 SIOSE Land Use Map Asturias Central Area 2011:  | Requisites: All maps must be rasters and have the same resolution, extent, projection and number of categories. LUC categories must be coded consecutively from 1 to the maximum number of categories considered. | Execution: If necessary, install the plugin Processing R provider and download the R scripts indicated above in the ""Available Tools"" table. Paste the R scripts into the R scripts folder. For more information, see Chapter ""About This Book"".
Step 1
Our maps do not comply with one of the requisites of the tools we will be using, in that the categories in our LUC maps are coded from 0 (agricultural areas) to 12 (background). The first step is therefore to reclassify the maps to ensure that all the categories are coded consecutively from 1 to 13. This is done using the Reclassify by table tool (Figs. 
Step 2
Once the maps comply with the requirements of the tools, the different metrics can then be calculated. To test the overall agreement between the assessed and the reference maps, we will calculate the overall spatial agreement (A 0 ), the overall areal inconsistency (OAI) and the overall spatial inconsistency (OSI). For their part, individual areal inconsistency (AIC) and individual spatial agreement (A i ) are used to assess agreement specifically for the ""urban fabric"" and ""industrial and commercial areas"" categories.
To calculate all these metrics, open the respective tool and select the maps you want to compare (Fig. 
For class-specific metrics indicate the codes of the classes you want to validate (Fig.  | Results and Comments: After calculating all the different metrics, a numerical output is obtained for each one (Tables 
There is a high overall spatial agreement (close to 90%) between the two maps and low areal inconsistency (around 3%). We can therefore consider the CORINE land cover map for 2011 as validated. The category proportions between CORINE and SIOSE are almost identical and the At the class level, the picture is slightly different. For the two classes we assessed (urban fabric and industrial and commercial areas) spatial agreement between the two maps to be close to 70%. Although this is a high level of agreement, it is much lower than the overall figure. This could be due to the fact that these two classes are more sensitive than others to the scale difference between SIOSE and CORINE.
In order to interpret the AIC metric, we need to first understand the proportion of total area allocated to each class on the two maps. AIC is half of the difference between the two proportions (i.e. if the proportion allocated to one class is 3% on one map and 4% on the other, the difference is 1% and AIC is 0.5). In our case, the AIC value for urban fabric is less than 0.1, which means a high level of agreement between the two maps regarding the proportion of total area allocated to this category (around 3.9%). The proportion allocated to industrial and commercial areas is around 3% in both maps and the AIC value is slightly more than 0.1. This also indicates a high level of agreement, although less than for urban fabric. | Exercise 2. To validate a simulation against a reference map:  | Aim: To validate the simulation obtained by our land use/cover change modelling exercise. We will focus on the two categories we have modelled actively: ""urban fabric"" and ""industrial and commercial areas"". | Materials:  | CORINE Land Use Map Asturias Central Area 2011 Simulation CORINE Asturias Central Area 2011: Requisites All maps must be rasters and have the same resolution, extent, projection and number of categories. LUC categories must be coded consecutively from 1 to the maximum number of categories considered. | Execution: Step 1
The first step is to reclassify our maps to make them comply with the requisites of the tools we will be using. These tools require the categories to be consecutively coded from 1. This means that ""agricultural areas"" (coded 0) must be given a new code (Fig. 
Step 2
Once the maps comply with the requirements of the tools, we can then calculate the different areal and spatial agreement metrics using the tools available in the R toolbox.
To evaluate the global agreement between the simulation and the reference map, we will calculate the overall spatial agreement (A 0 ), the overall areal inconsistency (OAI) and the overall spatial inconsistency (OSI). To evaluate agreement for the categories that we actively modelled, we will calculate the individual areal inconsistency (AIC) and the individual spatial agreement (A i ).
To calculate the metrics, open the corresponding tools and indicate the following: the simulation to be evaluated, the reference map (CORINE 2011), the background value of the maps (13) and the folder where the results will be stored.
For the class-specific metrics, you must also provide the codes of the classes you want to evaluate: in this case 3 (urban fabric) and 4 (industrial and commercial areas) (Fig.  | Results and Comments: Once you have finished the exercise, you will obtain an a CSV file for each metric. The results are summarized in Tables 
The results show almost perfect agreement between our simulation and the reference map. The maps share the same LUC in 99% of their area and the areal inconsistency is insignificant (0.26%). A similar pattern is observed in the actively simulated classes.
These results are misleading. There is perfect agreement between our simulation and the reference map in the persistence areas. However, it is not that high for those areas modelled as changes. Because there are relatively few changes in our study area, the disagreement between the two maps in areas where change is predicted has very little impact on the overall high levels of the agreement created by the correct simulation of permanence areas. To correctly validate the changes that we simulated, we should repeat this exercise, focusing exclusively on the areas that changed in   | Requisites: All maps must be rasters and have the same resolution, extent, projection and number of categories. LUC categories must be coded consecutively from 1 to the maximum number of categories considered. | Execution: Step 1
Our maps do not comply with the requirements for the tools. In the map of simulated changes, the categories are not consecutively coded from 1. In addition, the reference map of changes has many more categories than the map of simulated changes.
Using the Reclassify by table tool we can adjust the number of categories on the two maps to the two categories that appear in both (urban fabric and industrial and commercial areas), plus a third category covering non-changing areas and changes that were not simulated. These categories will be assigned codes 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Figures 
Step 2
After reclassifying the maps, we will calculate the following metrics to validate the simulated changes: individual areal inconsistency (AIC) and individual spatial agreement (A i ).
As we are only comparing two categories, the overall metrics provide the same information as the individual ones.
For each metric, we will open the corresponding tool, indicating the map of simulated changes to be validated (Land use map 1), the reference map of changes (Land use map 2), the background value of the maps (0), the category we are  going to evaluate (urban fabric, 2, Fig.  | Results and Comments: A CSV file will be created for each metric. The results are summarized in Table 
The same amount of changes took place in the reference map of changes as in our simulation. There is no disagreement on this point. However, unlike the previous exercise, the spatial agreement between the simulated and the reference changes was very low. The A i value for the two categories that were actively simulated was quite similar (less than 25%).
These results mean that only a quarter of the simulated changes were allocated in the same places as the changes observed on the reference map. This result, by itself, is not sufficient to consider the simulation invalid. We need to gain a better picture of the location of the changes that were simulated and their pattern. Even if they were not allocated in exactly the same places as on the reference map, they may be allocated in the same general area and follow a similar pattern, indicating that the model has correctly simulated the processes of change. To assess these aspects, we can perform  | Kappa Indices:  | Description: Kappa indices assess the agreement between two sources of spatial data, corrected by the agreement that is expected by chance. They are typically used to compare the agreement between two maps and to compare one map with reference information (e.g. a collection of validation points).
The first Kappa index (Cohen's Kappa) dates from 1960 
There are many critics of the widespread use of Kappa metrics, especially in LUCC modelling validation. There is now a general consensus that these indices should not be the only validation measures used when evaluating modelling exercises and maps. More information about the limitations of Kappa indices and the criticisms levelled against them can be found in  | QGIS Exercises: Available tools  | Requisites: The two maps must be rasters and have the same extent, spatial resolution, projection and legend. If they do not have the same legend, the user must reclassify the maps in such a way that they comply with this requirement. | Execution: Step 1
Open the r.kappa function and fill in the required parameters: raster to be validated (CORINE map) and reference raster (SIOSE map) (Fig.  | Results and Comments: Once the function has been executed, QGIS creates a new text file (.txt) in the specified folder. Users must manually access this folder to open the text file and see the results of the analysis. These include a cross-tabulation matrix of the maps, together with the Kappa value. For the two maps assessed, we obtained the following Kappa:
where 1 means total agreement, -1 total disagreement and 0 random agreement. A Kappa index value of 0.88 means that the two maps are very similar and therefore that our map has been validated. As a general rule, Kappas above 0.7-0.8 are considered good enough for validation. Kappas above 0.9 indicate very high agreement.
In our case, it is always important to bear in mind that SIOSE is made at a more detailed scale than CORINE. The two maps have different minimum mapping units and minimum mapping widths, which means that perfect agreement is impossible. The SIOSE map will always draw features that are not detected in CORINE because of its coarser scale. Kappa scores of almost 0.9, like this one, show almost perfect agreement between the two sources.
Users can also assess the agreement between CORINE and SIOSE at the category level so as to obtain more information about the similarities and dissimilarities between the two maps. To compute these metrics, they should refer to Exercise 3, using the Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin instead of r.kappa. | Exercise 2. To validate a simulation against a reference map:  | Aim: To validate the simulation obtained by our land use/cover change modelling exercise.  | Requisites: The two maps being compared must be rasters and have identical resolution, extent, projection and legend. For proper validation, the reference map must refer to the same date for which the landscape was simulated. | Execution: Step 1
Open the r.kappa function and fill in the required parameters: raster to be validated (Simulation) and reference raster (CORINE 2011) (Fig.  | Results and Comments: QGIS will create a text file in the specified folder. This file contains the Kappa value for our simulation: Kappa ¬º 0:99 where 1 means total agreement. The Kappa value indicates that the two maps are almost the same. However, this does not mean that the changes we simulated are the same as the changes that took place on the reference map (CORINE 2011) as compared to the map used as the starting point for our modelling exercise 
In our simulation, most of the landscape remains unchanged. The high Kappa value indicates that we have correctly modelled the persistence of these unchanged areas. However, it is difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions about how closely the changes we simulated fit the changes observed between the CORINE 2011 and 2006 maps. These changes only affect very small parts of the maps and, therefore, do not have a meaningful impact on the Kappa index when evaluating the agreement between the entire area of the maps.
In order to gain a better picture as to how well the simulated changes fit the changes in the reference maps, other complementary metrics also described in this book can be used, such as the quantity and allocation disagreement or the figure of merit (see Sects. 3 and 4 in Chapter ""Pontius Jr. Methods Based on a Cross-Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps""). The agreement between simulated and reference changes can also be assessed using Kappa simulation, although this metric is not currently implemented in any tool in QGIS or in its associated software, such as R.
Users can also evaluate the kappa agreement between the simulation and the reference map at the category level, for which purposes they should refer to the next exercise, Exercise 3.  | Requisites: The two maps to be compared must be rasters and have identical resolution, extent, projection and legend. For proper validation, the reference map must refer to the same date for which the landscape was simulated. | Execution: Step 1
The Kappa index can be calculated at the category level for all the categories in our map using the Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin. To this end, open the plugin and select the Accuracy (Postprocessing) option from the menu. Then choose the rasters to be assessed, i.e. the simulation and the reference map (Fig.  | Results and Comments: After executing the tool, we obtain a raster that cross-tabulates the compared maps and a CSV file with the The Kappa values for the two maps show high levels of agreement at both a general level and for all categories (Table 
The class with the lowest Kappa value is ""Built-up areas"". This indicates that many of the changes in this category have not been correctly simulated, which is to be expected given the dynamism of this category when compared with others such as forest or water surfaces. It is normally easier to simulate static land categories than changing ones. This explains why ""Built-up"" areas obtained a very low Kappa score compared to the overall score (Table 
Although these results offer some clues as to how well the changes in some categories were simulated, to obtain a more detailed understanding other methods and metrics should be used, such as the quantity and allocation disagreement and the figure of merit (see Sects. 3 and 4 in Chapter ""Pontius Jr. Methods Based on a Cross-Tabulation Matrix to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") or the Kappa simulation metrics. Whereas the Kappa metrics calculated here assess the agreement between persistent and changing areas in the compared and the reference maps, the other tools and methods focus on the specific areas that change between the initial and the final year of the simulation. This is a key element for understanding the success of our simulation, as it is easier to model persistence than change. | Agreement Between Maps at Overall and Stratum Level:  | Description: The aim is to assess the agreement between map pairs such as a reference map and a simulation map, at different levels:
overall agreement for the whole map, agreement for a given stratum, a smaller area, formed by a particular territory, LUC category or transition or by sample areas according to a gradient such as distance to a road. The purpose of this validation method is encapsulated in the following question: Does a particular item or area of interest show the same prediction score as the whole map?
Utility Exercises 1. To validate simulated changes against a reference map of changes A given map (LUC map, simulation) can be evaluated more precisely at spatial level (specific territory), category level (Is the simulation closer to the real situation for built-up areas or for forests?) or specific transitions (Does the model work better for the transition from forest to agriculture or from forest to pasture?). In this context, the entire area of interest can be used as a guide for interpreting particular simulation scores. | QGIS Exercise: Available tools Agreement between maps at the overall and stratum levels is more a validation approach than a specific method. Accordingly, there are no specific tools available in QGIS to carry out this analysis, as the used tool will depend on what type of analysis will be carried out at the overall and stratum levels.
For general operations, we will make use of the QGIS Raster Calculator. a generic tool performing all kinds of raster calculations. To calculate Kappa indices at the global and stratum levels, we will make use of r.kappa. For more information about this tool, please refer to the previous section.
Exercise 1. To validate simulated changes against a reference map of changes | Aim: To find out if the agreement between an observed (reference map) and a simulated transition varies for several distance-based categories resulting from a driver (e.g. distance to roads).  | Materials:  | Requisites: All maps must be in raster format with the same resolution, extent and spatial reference system (SRS). | Execution: Step 1
First, we have to obtain the observed and simulated transitions from agriculture and pasture land to built-up areas over the period 2012-2018. Using the raster calculator, we extract the observed (""CLC_2012@1"" = 2 AND ""CLC_2018@1"" = 1) and the simulated (""CLC_2012@1"" = 2 AND ""CLC_pre-dict_2018@1"" = 1) transition from agriculture and pasture land (Category 2) to built-up areas (Category 1). The result is shown in Fig. 
Step 2
The Reclassify by table raster analysis tool is used to transform the map showing the continuous distance from roads into Figure 
The next step is to compute observed and predicted transitions from Category 2 to Category 1 as a function of the road distance classes. To this end, we use the Raster calculator again to calculate: i) the road distance class map multiplied by the observed transition map and ii), the road distance class map multiplied by the simulated transition map. The results can be seen in Fig. 
Step 4 Finally, we compare observed and simulated transitions as a function of distances classes (strata). We use the Raster layer unique values report raster analysis tool to calculate the number of pixels for each road distance category (observed and simulation) for the transition from category 2 to 1 as shown in Fig. 
The results are then converted into percentage as shown in Table  | Results and Comments: The result is that there are almost three times as many observed transitions as predicted transitions. However, the proportion of near-to-road transitions is approximately the same. In conclusion, the model underestimates the quantity of agriculture and pasture land that is transformed into built-up areas, although in the areas close to roads, it accurately predicted what happened in the Ari√®ge Valley between 2012 and 2018.  | Description: The thematic accuracy assessment statistics are a set of parameters that measure the degree of agreement between the LUC map and the reference data (for more details about reference data, see Chapter ""Sample Data for Thematic Accuracy Assessment in QGIS""). Overall accuracy, user's accuracy and producer's accuracy are reported in many studies. Some additional accuracy measures such as the standard error of overall accuracy and the confidence intervals for the adjusted areas are also helpful.
All these parameters are mainly derived from the error or confusion matrix (see Chapter ""Basic and Multiple-Resolution Cross-Tabulation to Validate Land Use Cover Maps""). This matrix is obtained from a cross-tabulation between the reference data and the thematic map. In the resulting table, the reference data are generally shown in the columns and the map data in the rows (Table 
In Table 
Expressing the error matrix in terms of area proportions instead of sample counts enables the calculation of unbiased area estimators. The area proportions (b p ij ) are defined as follows:
where W i = (Map area of class i)/(Total area of the map).
Based on these area proportions, the overall estimated accuracy ( b O), user's accuracy ( b U i ) and producer's accuracy ( b P j ) are calculated with the following equations:
Errors of commission and omission are complementary concepts of the user's and producer's accuracy metrics, respectively (i.e. error = 1accuracy). An error of commission occurs when a feature is included in a thematic class to which it does not belong. In contrast, an error of omission occurs when a feature is excluded from the thematic class to which it belongs 
A j is the unbiased area estimator or adjusted area. In this case, the area estimator obtained directly from the map (A total ) is then adjusted by a factor obtained from the reference data. If there are more samples labelled as class j in the reference sample than in the map, then b A j will be larger than the area obtained directly by pixel counting. | Utility: Exercises 1. To validate a map against reference data/map
The statistics obtained from the thematic accuracy assessment are not only descriptors of the map quality but also represent a fundamental input for calculating unbiased area estimators. Additionally, they provide the necessary elements to decide whether to increase the number of sampling sites in the reference data, if the precision obtained does not meet the initial mapping objectives. | QGIS Exercise: Available tools | ‚Ä¢ MapAccurAssess Plugin: In QGIS, several plugins, such as Semi-Automatic Classification, AcATaMa and MapAccurAssess, can be used to calculate the map accuracy statistics. All three plugins provide the overall accuracy, producer's accuracy, user's accuracy and the error matrix, although AcATaMa and MapAccurAssess also report some additional statistics about the adjusted areas and their levels of accuracy.
In this exercise, we use the MapAccurAssess plugin because it can use a shapefile directly with the reference data. The results provided by this plugin, based on 
This plugin is a test version and has not yet been accepted in the official QGIS repositories.
Exercise 1. To validate a map against reference data/map Aim To validate a LUC map for the Marqu√©s de Comillas study area by computing accuracy assessment statistics and the error matrix via cross-tabulation of the reference data and the thematic map. | Materials:  | Marqu√©s de Comillas Land Use Cover Map 2019: Photointerpreted reference dataset-Marqu√©s de Comillas 2019 (reference dataset resulting from the exercise in Sect. 2 in Chapter ""Sample Sata for Thematic Accuracy Assessment in QGIS"") | Requisites: In order to compute the areas, the land cover map must be in raster format (GeoTiff) in any cartographic projection. The reference data must be contained in a shapefile with the same type of projection as the map. The shapefile attribute table must contain at least two columns, showing the value for the thematic class obtained from the land cover map and the value according to field ground-truthing or photointerpretation. Both columns must have the same data type (integer or text) to be comparable. Each row of the table corresponds to one reference site. | Execution: Step 1
Install the MapAccurAssess plugin. Should you need help, please see Chapter ""About This Book"" and the plugin's documentation.
Step 2
If the plugin has been successfully installed, an icon should appear in the main graphics panel. To start the exercise, click on this icon. Alternatively, go to the Complements menu, select Accuracy Assessment and then Accuracy Assessment again.
Step 3
Select the shapefile with the reference samples (Photo-interpreted reference dataset-Marqu√©s de Comillas 2019) 2 and indicate the column with the reference data and the column with the values for the thematic classes used in the map. After that, select the land cover map you want to assess (Marqu√©s de Comillas Land Use Land Cover Map 2019). If the map is in vector format, indicate the column containing the thematic class values. Finally, select a folder where the results will be saved and click ""Accept"" (Fig.  | Results and Comments: The output of this plugin consists of two CSV tables. The first contains the error matrix (Table 
According to the data from this exercise, the overall accuracy of the map is 0.91. In other words, there is a high probability (91%) that a randomly selected location on the map will be correctly classified. Note that the thematic class with the lowest accuracy is 130 (Wetland), with a user accuracy of 0.7 and a producer accuracy of 0.21. This class covers a small area (252 ha according to the map). We decided to keep this class to show that illogical situations can occur when there is only a small number of sampling sites, e.g. negative areas. However, we recommend merging class 130 with another class of similar characteristics and recomputing.

The exercises in this chapter focus, in particular, on the cross-tabulation techniques proposed by Robert Gilmore Pontius Jr., who has developed many indices and techniques in this field. Given his major contribution to this family of validation techniques, we have associated his name here with cross-tabulation techniques without this in any way implying that his scientific activity is limited to this field. The null model (Sect. 1) is especially useful for validating simulations, comparing the modelled map to a reference map with full persistence. LUCC budget (Sect. 2) only focusses on changes, which it splits into different components. This method can be used to compare the changes we want to validate with a reference set of changes, so providing interesting information as to how well our maps capture the dynamics of the landscape. Quantity and allocation disagreement (Sect. 3) analyse the differences between the reference map and the map being validated using two indices: disagreement in quantity and disagreement in allocation. The Figure of Merit (FoM) (Sect. 4) technique is used to validate a set of LUC changes by comparing them with a reference, distinguishing between different components of agreement: correctly simulated change, wrongly simulated or missing change. Incidents and States (Sect. 5) allows us to identify illogical transitions in a time series of maps by providing the number of states and transitions that a cell undergoes over the course of the series. Intensity analysis (Sect. 6) and Flow matrix (Sect. 7) also enable us to validate the logic of LUC changes in a time series of maps. Intensity analysis provides information on the speed of changes, identifying those transitions or changes that do not follow a logical trend, while the flow matrix enables us to spot unstable changes in a series of maps. In this chapter, we present examples of how these techniques can be used in different cases: to validate single LUC maps, to validate a series of maps with two or more time points, to validate simulated changes against a reference map of changes and to validate changes simulated by various models. All these techniques are illustrated by exercises using datasets from the Asturias Central Area and the Ari√®ge Valley.  | Description: The null model is a method specifically developed by 
If the agreement between the observed LUC at t 2 and the simulation map at t 2 is higher than that between observed LUC at t 2 and the so-called null model, the simulation has greater predictive power than the hypothesis of complete persistence (no change). The agreement between the null model, the simulation and the reference map is usually assessed using common cross-tabulation techniques and Kappa indices (see Sect. The null model helps to measure the relative success of a simulation compared to persistence in time. The usefulness of this method depends on the spatiotemporal dynamics of the study area.
The method is based on the hypothesis that a simulation is successful if it gets better validation scores than a landscape in which no changes occur. When simulating change in a study area in which little change is taking place, it may be difficult to correctly simulate these changes in the same positions as on the reference map of changes. As a result, the null model may provide better validation scores than the simulation, in that the null model avoids possible errors when allocating changes and always simulates persistence correctly. This is why the null model is especially useful for validating whether an LUCC model simulates persistence correctly.  | QGIS Exercise:  | Requisites: All maps must be rasters and must have the same resolution, extent and projection. | Execution: Step 1
The first step is to calculate the Kappa indices measuring the agreement between the simulation, the null model and the reference map showing observed LUC in 2018. We use the GRASS r.kappa raster tool to calculate the kappa values for agreement: (i) between observed LUC in 2012 duplicated in 2018 (null model) and observed LUC in 2018 and (ii) between observed LUC in 2018 and simulated LUC in 2018.
Step 2
We then generate the cross-matrices between the simulation, null model and reference map (CLC_2012 against CLC_2018 and CLC_predict_2018 against CLC_2018) using the Cross-classification tool (see Exercise 2 of Sect. 1 in Chapter ""Basic and Multiple-Resolution Cross-Tabulation to Validate Land Use Cover Maps""). This method complements the kappa agreement indices and provides additional information about the similarity between the different maps. Step 3
Once the cross-tabulations are obtained, on a spreadsheet we calculate the sum of cells on the diagonal (pixel-to-pixel correspondence). | Results and Comments: The resulting Kappa values are 0.9849 for the simulation (CLC_predict_2018 related to CLC_2018) and 0.9875 for the null model (CLC_2012 related to CLC_2018). The quantity and allocation correspondence (the proportion of diagonal pixels in the cross-matrices) are 98.22% for the simulation and 98.53% for the null model. Therefore, with both techniques, the null model obtains a slightly higher score than the simulation. Interpretation of these results is difficult and has to be done carefully due to the limitations of this technique and the criticisms often levelled against it. The results show that persistence is the dominant process (98.5% of the study area did not change between 2012 and 2018; null model). Taking into account that most models simulate persistence better than change, it would be difficult to obtain a higher prediction score for a study area in which so little land use change is taking place. The low proportion of changes makes it difficult to simulate the changes between land use categories correctly. The slightest error diminishes the performance of the simulation compared to the null model.
Other methods, such as the Figure of Merit (see Sect. 4), can provide a better picture on how the model correctly simulated the change. | LUCC Budget: Description LUCC budget is a technique for analysing land use/cover change (LUCC) using the cross-tabulation matrix obtained by overlaying two maps of the same area at two different dates. For each category, the changes are characterized in four components: gross gains, gross losses, net change and swap 
Gross gains are the areas gained by each category, and gross losses are the areas lost. Net change is the difference between gains and losses. In categories in which gains and losses are occurring in different places, swap is a measure of the real changes taking place which are not revealed by the net change indicator. It measures the total area in which an equivalent amount of gains and losses have taken place, i.e. if in one category there are gains of 5 ha in one place and losses of 3 ha in another, the 3 ha that it losses in one place and recoups in another are the swap (swap = 3 + 3 = 6 ha), while the remaining 2 ha (5-3) are the net change. | Utility: Exercises 1. To validate a series of maps with two or more time points When monitoring landscape changes, the LUCC budget technique helps to identify the most critical land use transitions and should ultimately facilitate linking patterns to process  | QGIS Exercise: Available tools
The components of change computed by the LUCC budget are derived from the cross-tabulation matrix. This matrix can be obtained by overlaying the two maps in QGIS and then calculating the LUCC budget values using a spreadsheet programme. However, we suggest using the LUCCBudget. rsx R script with the QGIS Processing R provider plugin. This script will carry out the entire LUCC budget calculation and will generate a table containing the values for the four components of change.
See Chapter ""About this Book"" for more detailed information about how to integrate R into QGIS and how to use R scripts such as the one applied in this exercise. | Exercise 1. To validate a series of maps with two or more time points:  | Aim: To carry out LUCC budget analysis in the Ariege study area using the CORINE Land Use maps dated 2000 and 2018. | Materials:  | CORINE Land Cover Map Val d'Ari√®ge 2000 CORINE Land Cover Map Val d'Ari√®ge 2018: Requisites All maps must be in raster format and have the same resolution, extent and projection. | Execution: If necessary, install the Processing R provider plugin, and download the LUCCBudget.rsx R script into the R scripts folder (processing/rscripts). For more details, see Chapter ""About this Book"".
Step 1
Then, run the script and fill in the required parameters (names of the two maps and the output table) as shown in Fig.  | Results and Comments: The script will generate the cross-tabulation or change matrix as shown in Table 
3 Quantity and Allocation Disagreement Description 
When analysing a time series (or single maps evaluated against a reference map), this method can differentiate between the changes that are due to differences in the relative importance of certain categories (some increase and others decrease) and those derived from changes in the location of the elements that make up these categories. It also identifies the categories that undergo net changes and swaps. As regards differences in location, this method distinguishes between exchanges between classes and changes in the location of two or more classes. | Utility: Exercises 1. To validate a series of maps with two or more time points Quantity and allocation disagreement assess how similar a simulation or simulation is to a reference map, differentiating between (dis)agreement that is due to the quantities of different classes and (dis)agreement caused by the allocation of these classes in different places. By providing the same information, this method can also be used to validate an LUC map against a reference map or to assess the LUC changes in a time series of maps and understand whether or not these changes follow a logical trend. | QGIS Exercise: Available tools For more information about the use of r.cross, r.kappa, SAGA Confusion matrix and SCP, please refer to Chapters  | Requisites: All maps must be in raster format with the same resolution, extent and spatial reference system (SRS). | Execution: Step 1
In order to be able to make this analysis, the CORINE LUC map for 2018 must be polygonized. To this end, use the tool Polygonize.
Step 2
After polygonizing the CORINE raster, the next stage is to cross-tabulate the two maps we are going to compare. To this end, open the SAGA confusion matrix tool and select the CORINE LUC map for 2012 as Classification 1 layer and the CORINE LUC map for 2018 as Classification 2 layer. Then, fill in the parameters for the following lines-Value, Value (Maximum) and Name-into the function. Do not change any default options (the ""Report unchanged classes"" box must be ticked; output as ""cells"" and open the results generated) (Fig. 
Step 3
Import the SAGA-generated confusion matrix obtained in the previous stage into a spreadsheet software such as Excel.
Then translate the obtained matrix into percentages (Table 
Step 4
Finally, use the SAGA-generated confusion matrix obtained in Step 2 to calculate the quantity and allocation disagreements in a spreadsheet software such as Excel. For a pixel resolution of 15 √Ç 15 m, 1 ha corresponds to 44.44 pixels.
Quantity disagreement is calculated by subtracting column total from row total (quantity disagreement = row totalcolumn total) (Table  | Results and Comments: Table 
Table 
Allocation disagreement corresponds to all not-diagonal cell values. These may be expressed as gains (2018-intersection 2012 against 2018) and losses (2012-intersection 2012 against 2018). While in some classes there are net changes (e.g. scrubland is the only category with net losses and no net gains), the changes in agriculture and pasture land are almost all losses (1.05), with just a few small gains (0.08%) from scrubland. This means that quantity disagreement shows a negative net balance for agriculture and  
‚Ä¢ CORRECT REJECTIONS (E) = the real maps show persistence and the simulation shows persistence.
Two complementary measures can be obtained using the same components of the Figure of Merit:
‚Ä¢ Producer's accuracy: A measure calculated using the ratio B/(A + B + C), which expresses ""the proportion of pixels that the model predicts accurately as change, given that the reference maps indicate observed change""  | Utility: Complementary analyses to the Figure of Merit and the Producer's and User's accuracies include spatial metrics, Kappa indices, the Land Use and Cover budget (LUCC budget) technique and Quantity and Allocation disagreement. These indices are described in Sects. 2 and 3 of this chapter. Chapter ""Basic and Multiple-Resolution Cross-Tabulation to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"", QGIS includes many tools for cross-tabulating spatial data in the GRASS and SAGA toolboxes. The ""Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin"" also includes cross-tabulation tools. | QGIS Exercises: Of all the tools available in QGIS, in this book, we recommend the ""Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin"", which is the most efficient, most stable tool of all those assessed.  | Requisites: The maps must have the same extent, spatial resolution, projection and legend. If they do not have the same legend, the maps must be reclassified to meet this requirement. For a proper validation, the latest reference map must refer to the same date as the simulation. | Execution: Step 1
We begin by obtaining two rasters showing the areas that changed in the study area during the period analysed and those that remained the same. This procedure must be done twice: once for the reference map (CORINE 2005-CORINE 2011) and once for the simulated map (CORINE 2005-Simulation 2011).
To obtain these maps, open the ""Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin"" and the ""Postprocessing"" tab. Then select Land cover change and fill in the required parameters: the earlier map in the reference classification 
Run the tool to obtain two output maps showing the changes on the reference map (CORINE) and the changes simulated by the model. Both will refer to the same period 
Step 2
The next stage involves cross-tabulating the two maps of changes. To obtain these maps, open the Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin and in the ""Postprocessing"" tab, select Accuracy. Select the required parameters: classification to assess (simulated changes) and reference raster (CORINE 05-11 changes) (Fig.  | Results and Comments: Step 1 produces two maps of changes, which are stored in the folder specified by the user. The function also generates a matrix for each pair of cross-tabulated maps. These matrices appear in the ""output"" window, stored in CSV format. They show each possible combination between the two cross-tabulated maps and the code under which each combination is represented in the output raster.
Only four transitions (new codes 3, 4, 16 and 17) are simulated by the model, as expressed in Table 
Most of the changes predicted in the simulation refer to the transition from agricultural areas (Category 0) to urban fabric (Category 2) and to the transition from agricultural areas to industrial and commercial areas (Category 3). Together, they represent 1,546 of the 1,632 pixels simulated. That is, almost 95% of the simulated pixels. In the reference map, these transitions represent 751 and 503 pixels, respectively, a less significant proportion of total change (in italics in Table 
After completing Step 2, we now have a cross-tabulation raster and a table showing every possible combination between the two cross-tabulated maps (Table 
Following the definitions provided by 
The WRONG HITS correspond to combinations where both the reference map and the simulation show change, but to different gaining categories. For example, new code 13 (old codes 3 and 4) refers to areas that were agricultural areas that changed to urban fabric in the simulation and to industrial and commercial areas in the reference map (Tables 
FALSE ALARMS refer to areas that are marked as persistence in the reference map and as change in the simulation. Examples include new code 2 (old codes 0 and 3). Areas with that code refer to pixels that were simulated as urban fabric in the simulation, but do not show change in the reference map. Code 0 does not appear among the codes in Table 
MISSES refer to the areas where the reference map shows change but the simulation shows persistence. Examples include code 16 (old code 4 and 0). Finally, CORRECT REJECTION refers to the pixels marked as persistence in the reference map that were correctly simulated as persistence (new code 1, old codes 0 and 0).
In total, HITS account for 347 pixels, WRONG HITS for 89 pixels, FALSE ALARMS for 1,196 pixels and MISSES for 4,869 pixels (Table 
With all the above information, we can finally calculate the We must also consider that the Figure of Merit compares the simulated changes with all the changes in the reference map. In our simulation, we only modelled two categories actively (urban fabric and industrial and commercial areas). This means that the changes in all the other categories were not even simulated and no agreement can therefore be expected. This limitation must be borne in mind when evaluating the Figure of Merit.
The best way to obtain a Figure of Merit that offers objective information about the validity of our modelling exercise is to repeat the same exercise, focusing exclusively on the actively modelled transitions (from agricultural and vegetation areas to urban fabric and industrial and commercial areas).
Producer's accuracy (B/(A + B + C)) is 6.54% and expresses the number of pixels that the model accurately predicts as change as a proportion of total observed change. For its part, User's accuracy (B/(B + C + D)) measures the number of pixels that the model predicts accurately as change as a proportion of total predicted change, in this case 21.26%.
As regards the four simulated changes, shown in Table  | Exercise 2. To validate simulated changes against a reference map of changes in a binary format:  | Aim: To validate the change simulated by a model against a reference map of changes for the same simulation period. To do this, we overlay two maps that show change versus non-change over the same period. The initial map in both cases is the CORINE dataset for 2005. The changes from 2005 to 2011 are calculated for the simulation and for the CORINE dataset as reference. In this exercise we do not evaluate the WRONG HITS.  | Materials:  | Requisites: The maps must have the same extent, spatial resolution, projection and legend. If they do not have the same legend, the maps must be reclassified so as to meet this requirement. For a proper validation, the latest reference map must refer to the same date as the simulation. | Execution: Step 1
The first step is to obtain two rasters showing the areas that changed and those that remained the same over the period being analysed: one for the reference map 
Step 2
Once the two maps have been obtained, they must be reclassified into binary format, i.e. into a map with two possible values: 0 (persistence) and 1 (changes). This is done using the Reclassify by table tool.  
Step 3
Finally, the two binary maps must be cross-tabulated. To do so, open the ""Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin"" and, in the ""Postprocessing"" tab, select the Cross-classification option. Fill in the required parameters: classification (binary changes from the simulation) and reference raster (binary changes from CORINE) (Fig.  | Results and Comments: Once we have completed Step 3, the QGIS creates an output raster that shows all possible combinations between the two binary change maps. The function also generates a table showing all possible combinations between the two input maps. This table appears in the ""output"" window, stored in CSV format. This table also lists the codes with which each combination is represented in the output raster. Table 
The sum of MISSES plus HITS (5,305 pixels) represents the change in the reference map (CORINE) for the period 2005-2011. These pixels cover just 0.9077% of the total study area. Very little change therefore took place in the reference map for our study area.
HITS plus FALSE ALARMS (1,632 pixels) gives all the pixels in which the simulation predicted change. These pixels cover 0.2792% of the total study area. This means that fewer changes were simulated than actually took place on the reference map. This makes sense given that in our simulation we only simulated the transitions from agricultural and vegetation areas to urban fabric and industrial and commercial areas, while the reference map also considered many other changes between all the other categories represented on the map, which were not simulated in our modelling exercise.
The Figure of Merit (B/(A + B + C + D)) for our simulation is very low at 6.7%. This indicates that the simulation did not simulate most of the changes that took place in the reference map correctly. This is partly due to the fact that we only actively modelled two categories, while the reference map showed the changes that took place between all categories. As a result, overlap between the two maps is impossible in many areas. Even so, the general level of overlap between the simulated changes and those observed on the reference maps is still quite low. Other metrics and tools must therefore be used in order to interpret the simulation and the performance of the modelling exercise better.
The Figure of Merit in this exercise is a bit better than in the previous one because we did not take WRONG HITS into account. In this case, we only compared changes, without taking into account the type of change that happened in the simulation period. | Exercise 3. To validate the changes simulated by various models:  | Aim: To compare and validate the change simulated by two models. For this purpose, we overlay three maps that show change versus non-change over the same interval. The initial map in all cases is the CORINE dataset for 2005. The changes from 2005 to 2011 are calculated for the simulation from model 1, for the simulation from model 2 and for the CORINE dataset as reference. WRONG HITS are not evaluated in this exercise.   | Requisites: The maps must have the same extent, spatial resolution, projection and legend. If they do not have the same legend, the maps must be reclassified so as to meet this requirement. For a proper validation, the latest reference map must refer to the same date as the simulation. | Execution: Step 1
The first step is to obtain three rasters for the study area showing the areas that changed and those that remained the same over the period being analysed. In this way, we obtain: The three output maps will show the change areas and the persistence areas for each of the three maps (the reference CORINE map and the two simulations) under consideration.
Step 2
Once these three maps have been obtained, they must be reclassified into binary maps in which persistence areas are reclassified as 0 and change areas as 1. The maps are reclassified using the Reclassify by table tool.
Step 3
The three binary maps must then be cross-tabulated, so as to be able to assess the congruence between the simulations and the reference map.
To do this, open the ""Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin"" and the ""Postprocessing"" tab, and then select Cross-classification. Start by cross-tabulating the two simulations you want to compare. To this end, fill in the following parameters: classification (binary map of changes from simulation 1) and reference raster (binary map of changes from simulation 2) (Fig. 
Step 4
The procedure is repeated again, this time cross-tabulating the raster obtained in the previous step with the reference map. In this case, open the tool and fill in the parameters as follows: classification (raster obtained after running the tool as explained in the previous step) and reference raster (CORINE 05-11 binary map of changes) (Fig.  | Results and Comments: After carrying out Steps 3 and 4, QGIS creates two output rasters. The function also generates a table for each raster, which appears in the ""output"" window in CSV format. This table shows every possible combination between the values of the cross-tabulated maps. It also lists the codes under which each combination is represented in the output raster.
The raster obtained in Step 3 measures the agreement between the two simulations (Table 
The raster obtained in Step 4 was produced by cross-tabulating a reference change map with the raster obtained after cross-tabulating the change maps produced by the two simulations. This cross-tabulation therefore produces eight possible combinations (Table 
In order to interpret the results of this second cross-tabulation correctly, we need to understand the values of the two rasters that were cross-tabulated. In the reference change map, 0 refers to persistent areas and 1 to areas that changed during the period under consideration. The meanings of the new codes in the raster obtained in Step 3 are detailed in Table 
This enables a better interpretation of the results of the last raster generated. New code 1 (previous codes 0/1) refers to areas in which persistence was observed on the reference map of changes (code 0) and was also simulated by the two   
New code 5 (1/1) corresponds to areas where both models simulated persistence and the reference map showed change (DOUBLE MISSES). New code 8 (1/4) refers to areas where the two models and the reference map also showed change (DOUBLE HITS). Finally, the other four combinations refer to areas where each simulation shows a different agreement with the reference map (Table 
These eight possible combinations are expressed as two maps. The first map (a zoomed area is shown in Fig. 
According to all the above results, it seems that the two simulations are very similar in terms of predictive accuracy. The vast majority of the pixels on the map are DOUBLE CORRECT REJECTIONS, which means that both models are very accurate when predicting persistence. This makes sense in that persistence is very easy to simulate in a highly stable area like the one we simulated. The most challenging task is to correctly simulate change. The best  If we focus exclusively on the areas that changed, the accuracy is very low. 86.1451% of the pixels were DOUBLE MISSES, while in the remaining pixels there were HITS in one or both models. This means that in the vast majority of cases, our models incorrectly simulated change. These simulations cannot therefore be validated, although other validation tools can be used to check whether the simulated pattern is valid. In this regard, even if a hard comparison does not show a high level of agreement between a simulation and the reference map, the pattern of the simulated changing areas may be logical or correct. The models can therefore be considered valid in a qualitative sense. | Incidents and States:  | Description: Incidents and states are terms proposed by 
Incidents refer to the number of times a pixel changes category over the course of a time series. There can be as many incidents as there are stages in the time series. In a series of 5 maps, there are 4 time-stages. The series may therefore have between 0 and 4 incidents, i.e. the pixel may change category between 0 and 4 times. The number of incidents can also be referred to as ""Transition frequency"". | Utility: Exercises 1. To validate a series of maps with two or more time points
The number of incidents and states assigned to the pixels in a time series of Land Use Cover maps can help us identify the changes that take place for technical reasons, i.e. erroneous or spurious changes which do not really happen on the ground.
When obtained from satellite imagery classification, Land Use Cover maps usually have important sources of uncertainty. Various different Land Use and Cover categories can have very similar levels of reflectance. If the imagery is obtained at different times of the year, or under different atmospheric conditions, the reflectance of a pixel can vary to a similar extent to the difference in reflectance between two Land Use Cover categories. The same pixel could therefore be classified under different categories over the course of the time series. The number of incidents and states of the pixel can potentially help us to identify these errors.
For example, in a time series of six maps, if a pixel has five incidents, but only two states, it means that it alternates between these two categories at each stage in the time series. If we discover which categories are involved in the transitions we can determine to what extent these changes are logical. Incidents and states can also be used to validate a series of simulations, when working with modelling exercises to obtain scenarios for more than two time points. | QGIS Exercise: Available tools
The GRASS toolbox associated with QGIS has a tool for calculating the number of states in a time series of Land Use Cover maps. QGIS does not provide any specific tool to calculate the number of incidents in the time series, so this metric must be calculated manually. This is done using the raster calculator and a raster reclassification tool. QGIS offers several raster calculators and reclassification tools. Although they are all valid, in this exercise we will be using the ones from the core QGIS toolbox.  | Aim: To find out if technical changes may have taken place in the last series of CORINE Land Cover maps produced for the Asturias Central Area. | Requisites: All maps must be rasters and have the same resolution, extent and projection. | Execution: Step 1
In order to calculate the number of states per pixel, we must open the r.series tool and select all the maps that form part of the series of Land Use Cover maps we are analysing (""Input raster layer(s)""). In this case, we select the three maps in our series: CORINE Land Cover 2005, 2011 and 2018.
In the ""Aggregate operation [optional]"" option, select ""Diversity"". This will count the number of different categories to which a pixel is assigned over the course of the time series.
In ""Advanced parameters"", indicate the range of values of the Land Use Cover maps introduced as input, i.e. the minimum and maximum values. In our case, the minimum value for a category is 0 and the maximum value is 12 (Fig. 
The final stage is to indicate where the new map will be saved.
Step 2
There is no specific tool for calculating the number of incidents in a pixel over the course of a time series. This operation must therefore be carried out manually. The first step is to identify where the changes happened. For each pixel, we must then calculate the number of times it underwent change (or not). To carry out these operations, we have to work with pairs of maps: first 2005 and 2011 and then 2011 and 2018.
To identify where the changes happened, for each pair of rasters we must subtract one raster from the other. If a pixel does not change, the result of the subtraction will be a value of 0 for that pixel. If the pixel changes, the result of the subtraction will be a value other than 0.
The subtraction operation is carried out using the Raster calculator, in which we must write the following subtraction expression for each pair of maps:
We also need to indicate which raster is the reference map that will be used to define the characteristics (extent, spatial resolution and projection) of the new raster obtained after the calculation. In this case, we will be using the first map in our series 
Step 3
Once the previous step has been completed, the maps obtained must be reclassified to enable us to identify the pixels where an incident took place (values other than 0) and the pixels that were incident-free at each stage (0 values).
To identify all pixels in which incidents took place with a value of 1, we reclassify all values other than 0 as 1 using the Reclassify by table tool (Fig. 
That means that all values between -999 and -1 will be reclassified with the value 1. The same will be true for all values between 1 and 999. If as a result of the raster subtraction we get bigger negative values than -999 or bigger positive values than 999 we will need to adjust the values in the reclassification table accordingly.
Step 4
The last step is to count the number of incidents for each pixel over the course of the time series. This is done using the Raster calculator, which adds together the rasters we reclassified in the previous step using the following expression:
The CORINE 2005 map will be used as a reference to define the characteristics of the output raster (Fig.  | Results and Comments: After completing all the operations described above, two different maps will be obtained: one with the number of states per pixel and another with the number of incidents per pixel.
The above maps (Fig. 
During the first stage of this process, the overall rate of land use change over each time interval is analysed to assess whether change was relatively fast or slow. To this end, the average annual rate of change for each time interval is compared with the average annual rate of change for the whole period.
The second stage analyses the intensity of change at category level within each time interval relative to the overall change rate for the interval calculated in stage one. It measures the gross losses and gross gains in area for each category so as to analyse whether the category shows a similar, stable pattern across the various time intervals in terms of the intensity of gains and losses. These observed intensities for each category are compared with an average annual rate of gains/losses that would exist if the changes within each interval were distributed uniformly over the entire time interval. This shows which categories are relatively dormant or active.
The final stage is at transition level. It examines the intensity of a particular transition over a given time interval, taking into account the different sizes of the categories and relative to the results of the category-level analysis. The gains made by a specific category may vary in size and intensity among the different categories from which it makes these gains. By comparing the observed rate of gains from each category with a uniform rate of gains that would exist if the gains were made uniformly from among all the available categories, we can identify those categories that are intensively avoided or targeted. Losses can be analysed in a similar way.
Intensity analysis also allows us to determine whether a particular transition occurs at a stable rate or occurs more intensely over a particular time interval within the series. If the same category is targeted (or avoided) over all the different time intervals, then this transition is said to be stationary. | Utility: Exercises 1. To validate a series of maps with two or more time points Intensity analysis analyses the size and intensity of land changes. It also checks for stationarity and takes the relative size of the categories into account, rather than just the absolute gains or losses they may undergo.
At the interval level, users can identify how quickly or slowly LUC change is taking place during each time interval as compared to the average annual rate of change over the whole time series. At the category level, intensity analysis allows users to identify which categories are dormant versus active in terms of gains or losses in the size of each category. At the transition level, when a given category makes gains or losses, users can identify which other categories are most intensively targeted or avoided. | QGIS Exercise:  | Available tools: ‚Ä¢ Aldwaik and Pontius matrix (Excel sheet) https://sites.google.com/site/intensityanalysis/ ‚Ä¢ R Package Intensity.analysis ‚Ä¢ Processing R provider Plugin Intensity_analysis.rsx R script There is not any specific tool available in QGIS to make intensity analysis, although this has been implemented in an R package (intensity.analysis)

Step 1
The land use maps need to be stacked into a multilayer file in chronological order. The first map is the oldest map. The second map is the next oldest and so on. This can be done with the Merge tool in the Raster tab.
Step 2
Run the script and fill in the required parameters (path and name of the time-series stack, null value, the path to the folder where the results will be saved, the path and name of the output plot) as shown in Fig.  | Results and Comments: The script will generate three files in the results folder: IntervalLevel.csv, CategoryLevel.csv and TransitionLevel. csv. A plot of the interval level is also produced. Plots of both the category and transition level have to be created from the Excel data sheet.
The first Excel file, called IntervalLevel.csv (Fig. 
The automatically generated plot is shown in Fig. 
The CategoryLevel.csv document (Fig. 
This figure shows the intensity of change in the different categories, regardless of their relative size within the study area. The categories with short bars to the left of the blue line representing average, uniform intensity are relatively inactive or dormant, whereas those that extend to the right are relatively active. For example, Category 1 showed the highest intensity in terms of land use gains, while Category 4 underwent more intense gains and losses than the average. At the other end of the scale, Category 3 was relatively Finally, the TransitionLevel.csv (Fig. 
Figure  | Flow Matrix:  | Description: The Flow Matrix was developed by 
The Flow Matrix is a cross-tabulation matrix that shows the proportion of the study area that transitions from one category to another, excluding persistence. It assumes linear change over time during each time interval. It allows us to calculate: (a) the annual proportion of the study area that changes during each time interval and (b) the uniform annual proportion of the study area that changes over the entire time series, and the proportion of change that would have to be reallocated to different time intervals in order for change to be perfectly stable (R). When change is perfectly stable, R is zero. This value increases as change becomes more unstable.
A vertical bar chart is produced showing the amount of annual land use change during each time interval as compared to the uniform annual change. | Utility: Exercises 1. To validate a series of maps with two or more time points
The Flow Matrix provides an analysis of the temporal extent at which phenomena are stable. It can be used to find out whether land use change takes place at a uniform rate over the course of the entire study period or if more change takes place during certain intervals. It can also be used to detect errors. If one particular interval is very different from the others in terms of its annual change rate, this may be due to errors in the mapping or the methodology.
The Flow Matrix can also be used in the selection of particular calibration intervals when developing future historical trend simulations, as the data should show the greatest possible uniformity in past land use change. It can also be used to assess whether the results of a trend scenario are consistent, i.e. whether the model simulates much more or much less change than actually happened in the historical series.  The first script will generate two tables in CSV format with the stable and unstable data that would exist for the whole study period, respectively. The second script will generate two tables, in CSV format, presenting the annual change for each interval and the uniform rate, respectively. It also produces a plot showing this annual change and the uniform rate for the entire time series.  | Requisites: All maps must be in raster format and have the same resolution, extent and projection. | Execution: If necessary, install the Processing R provider plugin and download the Stable_change_flow_matrix.rsx and Flow_-matrix_graf.rsx R scripts into the R scripts folder (processing/ rscripts). See Chapter ""About this Book"" of this book for further information about how to use the QGIS R script.
Step 1
Then, run the stable and unstable change script (stable_change_flow_matrix.rsx) and fill in the required parameters: number of time points (in this case, 3), background value (in this case, 0), land use maps and number of years between the time points. Make sure you save the files in the correct folder (Fig. 
Step 2
Now, run the Annual Change Rates script (Flow_matrix_graf.rsx). Fill in the parameters as in the previous section (Fig.  | Results and Comments: Step 1 generates two CSV files containing the data regarding unstable change (Fig. 
Stable change is the percentage of change that is stable in our study area between the first and the second intervals. This data is used to calculate the R value (R = 1stable change). In this case R = 1 -0.94; R = 0.06.
Step 2 produces a chart showing the annual amount of land use change (expressed as a proportion of the study area) during each time interval and the uniform rate that would exist if the annual changes were distributed uniformly across the entire time period. This is shown as a horizontal line in Fig. 
The tool also provides us with data about the annual land use change during each interval, as a percentage of the study area (Fig. 
These results show that land use change did not occur at the same uniform rate over the course of the study period and there was more change in the second interval. It should The maps validated here could be used for simulating future trend scenarios, as there is not much difference between the intervals in terms of the annual rate of land use change. | References: Aldwaik SZ, Pontius RG (  | Abstract: In Land Use Cover Change (LUCC) modelling, soft maps are often produced to express the propensity of an area to land use change. These maps are generally prepared in raster format, and have values of between 0 and 1, indicating the propensity of each pixel to change. In the literature, they are referred to as suitability, change potential or change probability maps. These maps are sometimes considered as the final product of a model (e.g. map of deforestation risk), but they can also serve as intermediate products that simulate the changes from which a hard-simulated land use/cover map can later be prepared using, for example, a cellular automaton. In both cases, it is essential to evaluate the soft map's ability to identify the areas that are most susceptible to change. One way of assessing this ability is to compare the spatial coincidence between the real changes observed on the ground and the values estimated by the soft map. One would expect real change areas to coincide with high change potential values (near 1) and real no-change areas with low change potential values (near 0). This comparison can be made using various statistical approaches including Correlation Coefficient (Sect. 1), the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) (Sect. 2) and the Difference in Potential (DiP) (Sect. 3). Other measures, such as total uncertainty, quantity uncertainty and allocation uncertainty (Sect. 4), are used exclusively in the analysis of soft maps. In this chapter, we describe the fundamental steps involved in these four statistical approaches to validating the soft maps produced by a model. The four sections are illustrated with specific cases: to validate soft maps produced by the model, to validate soft maps produced by the model against a reference map and to validate soft maps produced by various models against a reference map. We use the Ari√®ge database to validate the different soft maps (change potential and suitability maps) produced by the model by comparing them with real land use maps of the Ari√®ge Valley for two dates  | Requisites: All maps must be raster and have the same resolution, extent and projection. | Execution: Step 1
To create the map of real change, open the ""Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin"" and, in the tab ""Postprocessing"", select the option Land cover change. Then, fill in the required parameters: the earlier map in the reference classification (CORINE 2012) and the more recent map in the new classification 
Step 2
The raster obtained in Step 1 is reclassified twice: (i) to represent the areas in which a change was observed from 2 to 1 and those in which there was no change and (ii) to do the same for the transition from 3 to 1.
To reclassify the raster, open the Reclassify by table tool and allocate a new code 1 to ChangeCode 16 (transition from 2 to 1) and a new code 0 to ChangeCodes 17, 18, 19 In Fig.  | Description: Correlation is a statistical measure that evaluates the extent to which two variables are related. This means that when one variable changes in value, the other variable also tends to change. Correlation coefficients are quantitative metrics that measure both the strength and the direction of this tendency of two variables to vary together. The correlation coefficients range from 1 to -1. A coefficient of 1 shows a perfect positive correlation, while a coefficient close to zero indicates that there is no relationship between the variables. A coefficient of minus 1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, that is, as one variable increases, the other decreases.
The Pearson correlation measures the linear correlation between two variables. Spearman's correlation is the non-parametric version of the Pearson correlation and is based on the rank order of the variables rather than on their values. Spearman's correlation is often used to evaluate non-linear relationships or relationships involving ordinal variables. We used Pearson and Spearman correlations to assess the correlation between the map showing real changes and its respective change potential map. The correlation between a binary variable and a continuous variable is known as a Point-Biserial Correlation and measures the strength of association between the two. | Utility:  | QGIS Exercise: Available tools
We have created an R script to calculate in QGIS the Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. This script performs a sampling of the images and calculates both the Pearson and Spearman correlations.
Exercise 1. To validate soft maps produced by the model against a reference map of changes | Aim: To calculate the correlation between the map showing real change from 2 to 1 and the corresponding map of potential change. | Materials: TrueChange2to1 (calculated in the preliminary QGIS exercise in this chapter) Transition potential map from agricultural to artificial areas | Requisites: All maps must be in raster format and have the same resolution, extent and projection. | Execution: If necessary, install the Processing R provider plugin and download the Correlation.rsx R script into the R scripts folder (processing/rscripts). For more details, see Chapter ""About this Book"". | Initial maps: The initial maps for comparison are the TrueChange2to1 map (see the preliminary QGIS exercise in this chapter) and the map showing the change potential from 2 to 1 (Fig. 
Values range from 0 (black) to 0.977082 (white), the value for the areas with maximum change potential. The areas with a value of 0 (black) are those in which there is no potential for change.
Step 1
Run the script and fill in the required parameters (names of the two maps, proportion of pixels to be sampled, Null value) as shown in Fig. 
The script samples the images in order to speed up the computing of the correlation coefficients. It then displays both the Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients and a scatterplot in the log files (Figs.  | Results and Comments: As can be seen in Fig. 
ROC applies thresholds to the probability map to produce a sequence of binary predicted event maps and assess the coincidence between predicted and real events. A curve is obtained in which the horizontal axis represents the false positive rate (proportion of no-event cells modelled as an event) and the vertical axis the true positive rate (proportion of true event cells modelled as an event).
A standard metric based on the ROC curve is the area under the curve (AUC). If the actual events coincide perfectly with the highest ranked probabilities, then the AUC is equal to one. A random probability map produces a curve in which the true positive rate equals the false positive rate at all threshold points, and AUC is therefore 0.5. Probability maps that produce a ROC curve below the diagonal (AUC < 0.5) have less predictive accuracy than a random map  | Utility: Exercises 1. To validate soft maps produced by the model against a reference map of changes
The main application of ROC analysis in spatial modelling is in the assessment of maps that predict events such as land use/cover change, species distribution, disease and disaster risks. | QGIS Exercise: Available tools
QGIS does not provide any tool for ROC analysis, although R provides several packages to this end. We implemented the ROCAnalysys.rsx R script in QGIS using the QGIS Processing R provider plugin and the ROCR package to plot the ROC curve and calculate the AUC

To validate soft maps produced by the model against a reference map of changes | Aim: To assess the accuracy of a change potential map using ROC analysis. | Materials: TrueChange2to1 (calculated in the preliminary QGIS exercise in this chapter) Transition potential map from agricultural to artificial areas  | Requisites: All maps must be in raster format and have the same resolution, extent and projection. | Execution: If necessary, install the Processing R provider plugin, and download the ROCAnalysis.rsx R script into the R scripts folder (processing/rscripts). For more details, see Chapter ""About this Book"".
Step 1
Then run the script and fill in the required parameters (Fig. 
The maps have large numbers of both ""event"" and ""non-event"" cells, although there are normally more ""event"" cells than ""non-event"" cells. The PercentSampled parameter uses random sampling to reduce the number of non-event cells observed. | Results and Comments: The script carries out a sampling of the cells, plots the ROC curve and calculates the AUC. The ROC curve (Fig. 
We assessed the change potential map for the transition from Category 2 (agriculture) to Category 1 (built-up) using ROC analysis. An AUC of 0.74 was obtained. We can therefore conclude that this predictive map was reasonably successful at identifying the agricultural areas that were most likely to be converted to built-up over the period 2012-18. | Difference in Potential (DiP):  | Description: DiP is based on the Peirce Skill Score (PSS): In DiP, proposed by  | Utility: Compared to other assessment techniques such as ROC analysis (see previous section), which is based on a relative threshold, DiP analysis is a measure of absolute threshold. As  | QGIS Exercises: Available tools The Difference in Potential is a simple subtraction between average values from two maps. The required functions are related to zonal statistics which is why in these exercises we will be using the Raster layer zonal statistics tool.
Exercise 1. To validate soft maps produced by the model against a reference map of changes | Aim: To validate and compare two change potential maps (soft maps), obtained from the same model, against a reference map-CORINE Land Use map of real changes (from 2012 to 2018). | Materials: TrueChange2to1 (calculated in the preliminary QGIS exercise in this chapter)  | Requisites: All maps must be raster and have the same resolution, extent and projection. | Execution:  | Initial maps: In this exercise, we will be using the TrueChange2to1 and the TrueChange3to1 maps (see the preliminary QGIS exercise in this chapter), the change potential map from 2 to 1 (see Sect. 1) and the change potential map from 3 to 1 (Fig. 
Step 1
We open Raster layer zonal statistics (located in the Processing Toolbox) to extract the mean values from the change potential map from 2 to 1 (Input layer) using the TrueChange2to1 map as the Zones layer (Fig. 
We then repeat the exercise with the change potential map from 3 to 1 (Input layer) using the TrueChange3to1 map as the Zones layer. | Results and Comments: The mean value for change potential from 2 to 1 in the candidate areas that actually change to Category 1 is 0.43, while in the candidate areas that did not change, the mean value is 0.20. Therefore, the Difference in Potential is 0.23.
In spite of the fact that the change potential is twice as high in the areas that changed to Category 1 than in those that did not change, the absolute potential (about 0.43) is quite low.
As regards the change from 3 to 1, the mean value for change potential in the candidate areas that change to Category 1 is 0.31, while in the candidate areas that did not change, the mean value is 0.02. Therefore, the Difference in Potential is 0.29. In spite of the fact that the absolute difference is quite low, it is important to highlight that the change potential value in the candidate areas that did not change is almost zero. From this point of view DiP throws up interesting results.
The fact that these soft maps have similar DiP values means that they have similar predictive capacity. This is slightly higher in the map charting potential change from 3 to 1, although we should also bear in mind that the change from 3 to 1 affects just one small, contiguous area. | Exercise 2. To validate soft maps produced by various models against a reference map of changes Aim: To validate and compare two soft maps obtained from two different models against a reference map-CORINE Land Use map of real changes (from 2012 to 2018). | Materials: TrueChange2to1 (calculated in the preliminary QGIS exercise of this chapter) Transition potential map from agricultural to artificial areas Markovian probability map for artificial areas Ari√®ge Valley | Requisites: All maps must be raster and have the same resolution, extent and projection. | Execution:  | Initial maps: In this exercise, we will be using the TrueChange2to1 (see the preliminary QGIS exercise in this chapter), the change potential map from 2 to 1 (see Sect. 10.1) and the Markovian probability map for Category 1 (Fig.  | Step 1: In order to obtain the mean values from the change potential map for the transition from 2 to 1, follow the process set out in Exercise 1 of this section. Step 2
We now use the Raster layer zonal statistics tool to extract the mean values from the probability map for Category 1 (Input layer) using the TrueChange2to1 map as zones (Zones layer). In other words, in both soft maps (change potential map and probability map) we extract the mean values using the same map as zones. | Results and Comments: As commented in Exercise 1 of this section, the mean value for change potential from 2 to 1 in the candidate areas that did actually change to Category 1 is 0.43; while in the candidate areas that did not change, the mean value is 0.20. This means that the Difference in Potential is 0.23. In spite of the fact that the change potential is twice as high in the areas that changed to Category 1 than in those that did not change, the absolute potential (about 0.43) is quite low.
The mean value for the probability of Category 1 in the candidate areas that did actually change from Category 2 to 1 is 0.013, while in the candidate areas that did not change, the mean value is 0.0098. The Difference in Potential is therefore 0.0032. This very small difference means that the only Markovian-generated probability map has no predictive value.
The two soft maps, each generated by a different model to predict the changes in land use and cover, produce highly varying results: some areas considered to have high change potential by one model are attributed low change potential by the other.
In this case, it is important to remember that we are comparing two quite different change potential maps. Firstly, a change potential map in which only one specific transition is evaluated (in this case from 2 to 1) and therefore only one source category (Category 2) is considered for its potential for change to the target category (Category 1). Secondly, a suitability map, which generates the probability of any part of the study area belonging to a particular target category (in this case Category 1) at the end of the period regardless of its original source category. However, when comparing the outputs of these models, we evaluated the same transition in both soft maps and validated them against the same real change.
The second main difference is that the change potential map is based not only on two LUC maps but also on selected drivers, while the Markov Probability map is computed without additional knowledge (drivers). The conclusion is that when comparing different maps, it is important to bear in mind that the data may have been obtained in different ways.

where PM = the average for the values less than 0.5 (pixel values equal to or higher than 0.5 are previously set to zero); PF = average of soft prediction map where values less than 0.5 are set to zero while values equal to or higher than 0.5 are converted into their complement to 1 (0.8 becomes 0.2; 0.51 becomes 0.49). The uncertainty indices proposed by  | Utility:  | QGIS Exercise: Available tools | ‚Ä¢ Raster Raster Calculator Raster Layer Statistics: There is not any specific tool implemented in QGIS or R that allows to directly calculate the uncertainty indices proposed by  | Exercise 1.

To calculate the PM map (probability of being a miss), we use the Raster Calculator twice. First, we generate an intermediate map in which all pixel values less than 0.5 are coded as 1: calculator expression = ""CLC_predict_2018_-soft_UTM@1"" < 0.5. Then, we multiply this mask (intermediate map named ""TMP_1"") by the soft prediction map: calculator expression = ""TMP_1@1"" * ""CLC_pre-dict_2018_soft_UTM@1"". As a result, we obtain the PM map (Fig. 
Step 2
To calculate the PF (probability of being a false alarm) map, we need to use the Raster Calculator again. With the calculator, we can first compute an intermediate map in which all pixel values equal to or greater than 0.5 are coded as 1: calculator expression = ""CLC_predict_2018_soft_UTM@1"" > = 0.5. Then, we subtract the values of the soft prediction map from 1 before multiplying it by the mask (intermediate map, here named ""TMP_2""): calculator expression = (1-""CLC_predict_2018_soft_UTM@1"") * ""TMP_2@1"". As a result, we obtain the PF map (Fig. 
Step 3
Finally, we use the Raster Layer statistics tool to calculate the average PM and PF values from the corresponding maps.
2018 PM average ¬º 0:00963 2018 PF average ¬º 0:00577
Step 4
Once we have obtained the PM and PF values, we can calculate the Quantity Uncertainty (QU), Allocation Uncertainty (AU) and Total Uncertainty (TU) following the formulas provided by  | Spatial Metrics: Description Spatial metrics are a set of indices or metrics that were first developed within the field of landscape ecology 
Spatial metrics were initially developed for raster data, although some of them have also been adapted for calculation with vector data, for which the polygon is the unit of measurement. For raster data, the reference concept for calculating the metrics is the patch.
A patch is defined as a contiguous area of pixels belonging to the same category. The number and shape of the patches in a raster will depend on the neighbourhood rule applied (Fig. 
Spatial metrics can be calculated at three different levels: per patch, per category or for the whole map (landscape level). In the first case, each metric is calculated for every single patch. In the second case, the metrics are calculated for all the patches belonging to every single category on the map. In the last case, the metrics are calculated for the map as a whole. Not all metrics can be calculated for the three levels of analysis, but some of them are only available for certain levels of analysis.
There is a wide variety of metrics available, and new ones are regularly being proposed (Botequilha 
Spatial metrics are usually classified into groups according to the information they provide: area, density and edge metrics; shape metrics; connectivity metrics and diversity metrics. The first group (area, density and edge) provides information about the area and perimeter of the patches. Shape metrics assess the complexity of the shape of the patches, based on their area and perimeter, while connectivity metrics quantify the degree to which patches relate to each other (how connected they are) and are usually calculated at the category level. Finally, diversity metrics quantify the heterogeneity of the map and can only be computed at a landscape level.

To validate a series of maps with two or more time points (raster) Spatial metrics are some of the most popular tools for analysing the pattern of categorical maps. Using the wide diversity of spatial metrics currently available, we can obtain numerous quantitative measurements of the fragmentation, shape complexity and heterogeneity of the landscape.
Spatial metrics can be calculated for the whole map or for certain specific features. In the case of Land Use Cover Change analyses, including LUCC modelling, spatial metrics can be specifically used to characterize the pattern of the elements that change.
Spatial metrics are usually highly dependent on the scale of analysis 
For maps at the same scale, spatial metrics can be used to assess to what extent their patterns differ. In other words, they assess the relative complexity of their shapes and perimeters, the degree to which they are fragmented, or how close patches belonging to the same categories are to each other. | QGIS Exercises: As mentioned earlier, there are a lot of spatial metrics available, many of which are highly correlated. Despite this, there is a wide range of different metrics that characterize map patterns in different ways.
It would be impossible to present example exercises for all the available spatial metrics in the literature, as there would be enough material to fill an entire book. This is why, in the exercises proposed here, we focus on the metrics most commonly used for validating maps or analysing their uncertainties. These metrics are also suitable for many other exercises that users may typically wish to perform. However, they should be aware that other metrics are available which may be more suitable or useful in certain specific cases. Despite the widespread use of spatial metrics, QGIS offers few tools for calculating them. For vector maps, we have the Polygon shape indices tool, which characterizes the area, perimeter and shape compactness of polygons. Metrics are calculated for each polygon, i.e. at patch level.
Of the tools available for raster maps, we highlight two: the LecoS plugin 
The SAGA tool only allows the user to calculate a few metrics (relative richness, diversity, dominance, fragmentation, number of different classes, centre versus neighbours), although these are not amongst the most frequently used when comparing map patterns. These metrics can only be calculated for the entire landscape or study area and are not available at patch or class level. In addition, although the user may select the window at which the spatial metrics are calculated (3 √Ç 3, 5 √Ç 5 or 7 √Ç 7), the 8-cell neighbourhood rule is applied by default and cannot be changed.
The ""LecoS"" plugin offers a wider set of metrics and two levels of analysis: per class and for the entire map. It also provides a few extra tools with which to manipulate the maps and extract specific elements that may be of interest to users. The plugin also allows us to calculate the metrics for specific areas of the map that overlay a vector layer defined by the user. Nonetheless, these spatial metrics cannot be calculated per patch and the 8-cell neighbourhood used by default for the calculation cannot be changed. For full information about the plugin and the various possibilities it offers, readers should consult the Lecos website and the paper by 
The R package ""landscapemetrics""
Although the R package offers us all the options currently available for calculating spatial metrics, in this chapter we will be focusing exclusively on the LecoS plugin. This is because it provides enough tools for the exercises we propose, and is a tested, efficient software which allows us to perform these analyses easily and quickly. | Exercise 1. To validate a map against reference data/map:  | Aim: To assess to what extent the pattern of the CORINE map is similar to the pattern of the reference SIOSE map, which charts the real situation on the ground. | Materials:  | SIOSE Land Use Map Asturias Central Area 2011 CORINE Land Use Map Asturias Central Area 2011:  | Requisites: The two maps must be raster. The background class must be 0 or no data. | Execution: Step 1
One of the requisites of the ""LecoS"" plugin is that no category, apart from the background, is coded with the number 0. In our maps, the category ""agricultural areas"" is coded 0. The first step is therefore to reclassify the maps, so the background is coded 0 (currently it is coded 12) and all other categories have different codes other than 0.
The maps are reclassified using the Reclassify by table tool (Processing toolbox > Raster analysis > Reclassify by table ). After opening the tool, indicate the map you want to reclassify (CORINE map) and fill in the ""Reclassification table"" with the values that will replace the existing values in the raster (Fig. 
Bearing these criteria in mind, fill in the reclassification table and run the tool (Fig. 
Step 2
After running the tool, you will obtain a reclassified map that meets the requirements of the LecoS plugin. You are now in a position to calculate the spatial metrics. This is done by accessing the Landscape statistics option of the ""LecoS"" plugin via the following route: Raster > Landscape ecology > Landscape statistics.
Once there, in the ""Landcover grid"" box indicate the raster for which you want to calculate the spatial metrics (CORINE reclassified), the ""No-data"" value (0, which is the background) and the spatial resolution of the raster (50 m, which you can check in the layer properties). You must also select the particular metrics you want to obtain (Fig. 
Several spatial metrics can be selected at the same time, using the ""Select multiple metrics"" tab. In this case, we selected the following: Land cover; Landscape proportion; Number of patches; Greatest patch area; Smallest patch area; Mean patch area; Median patch area; Fractal dimension index; Like adjacencies; Patch cohesion index. Once you have done this, run the function.
If your computer is unable to calculate all the metrics at the same time, split the task into two (e.g. two groups of five metrics). In this case, after running the tool for the second time, the results must be gathered together in a single file, as the plugin creates one file for each time you run the tool.
Step 3
The last step is to repeat the whole workflow for the reference raster, i.e. for the SIOSE map. In this case, you will probably need to split the spatial metrics calculation into different steps as the plugin may be not able to handle all the information at once. As the SIOSE map is made up of a larger number of patches, the plugin will need more time to make all the calculations. | Results and Comments: Once the spatial metrics for each of the maps have been calculated, the results of the analysis will be stored in CSV files in the folder of your choice.
You will have one file for each time you have run the tool. The first step will therefore be to gather all the information together in one file to make it easier to compare the spatial metrics for the two maps (Table 
The ""Land cover"" and ""Landscape proportion"" metrics (Table 
The ""Land cover"" metric indicates the surface area in square metres occupied by each category. The ""Landscape proportion"" gives the proportion of the entire map (out of 1) occupied by each category. If the two maps have the same extent, both metrics will provide the same information, albeit in different units (square metres and percentage). Comparing maps with different extents is not recommended and could lead to important issues in the interpretation of the analysis.
In our case, the landscape composition of the two maps is very similar. All the categories are represented in similar proportions. Nonetheless, some differences were observed in the case of mineral extraction sites (Category 5 after reclassification), dump sites (Category 6) or road and rail networks (Category 7), among others.
The ""Number of patches"" (Table 
Unlike landscape composition, important differences can be observed between the two maps in terms of landscape configuration. The SIOSE map is much more fragmented than the CORINE one. This difference is very significant for example in the road and rail networks category (Category 7   after reclassification). Whereas in CORINE this class is made up of just 28 patches, in SIOSE it is much more fragmented with 2,464 patches (Table 
Those land use categories that usually appear on the ground in small areas, such as small dump sites, or with linear features such as most of the road network, are not represented on the CORINE map, although they do appear in SIOSE. This explains the differences between the two maps in terms of the areas or proportions of certain classes referred to above.
It would be wrong therefore to conclude that CORINE does not map these areas of disagreement between the two maps well. They do not appear in CORINE simply because it has different MMU and MMW rules.
The ""Greatest patch area"" and ""Smallest patch area"" metrics (Table 
These two metrics highlight CORINE's simpler pattern and higher level of generalization. With a few exceptions, the largest patch in CORINE is usually larger than its counterpart in SIOSE. For the smallest patch, there are small differences between the maps. In most cases, the smallest patch occupies 2,500 m 2 in both maps. In other words, the smallest patch covers a single pixel with a 50 m edge (50 √Ç 50 = 2,500 m 2 ). It does not comply with the MMU and MMW rules of CORINE. This may be due to the presence of isolated pixels on the edge of the map after clipping it or due to the rasterization process.
The ""Mean patch area"" and ""Median patch area"" metrics (Table 
The ""Fractal dimension index"" (Table 
Contrary to what might be expected, and with the exception of the port areas (Category 9 after reclassification), patch shapes were more complex in CORINE than SIOSE. This seems illogical given that SIOSE is made at a finer scale (1:25,000) than CORINE (1:100,000) and delimits land use areas more accurately.
In our case, CORINE has more complex patch shapes than SIOSE because of the rasterization of the CORINE and SIOSE vector databases, which reduced the complexity of the SIOSE polygons, resulting in more regular shapes. Finally, ""Like adjacencies"" and the ""Patch cohesion index"" (Table 
The ""Like adjacencies"" metric is based on the number of adjacencies between pixels, whereas the ""Patch cohesion index"" is obtained by calculating the ratio between the area and the perimeter of the patches. This means that although they provide information on a similar subject (compactness), they complement each other.
These metrics show that land uses are represented in a more compact (more clustered) manner in the CORINE database. This makes sense because of the lower degree of fragmentation and the greater generalization of CORINE compared to SIOSE.
All in all, even if important differences between the two maps could be identified in terms of landscape configuration, most of these are due to the different criteria used in the drawing of each map. This also applies to the small differences in terms of landscape composition. Our CORINE map must therefore be considered validated after comparison with SIOSE.
However, in order to be able to validate CORINE with certainty and to interpret the results of the spatial metrics more effectively, we should always compare the maps via visual inspection. In this case, visual inspection reveals that the differences identified by the spatial metrics are mostly due to the different criteria used in the drawing of each map, and not because they interpret land use in different ways.
Complementary tools must therefore be used to contextualize the results of our validation or uncertainty analysis. If this is not done, there is a high chance that we will make incorrect assumptions due to not having all the relevant information.
Exercise 2. To validate a simulation against a reference map | Aim: To assess to what extent the pattern of our simulation is similar to the pattern of a reference map for the same year, which accurately reflects the real situation on the ground. | Materials: Simulation CORINE Asturias Central Area 2011 CORINE Land Use Map Asturias Central Area 2011 | Requisites: The two maps must be raster. The background class must be 0 or no data. For a proper validation, the reference map and the simulation must refer to the same year. | Execution: Step 1
In order to comply with the requirements of the ""LecoS"" plugin, which assumes that pixels with the value 0 are No Data or background, we must first reclassify the two maps we are going to compare. The background, which is coded as 12, must be reclassified as 0. Agricultural areas, which were coded as 0, must be reclassified as 1. All the remaining classes must be reclassified following the same criteria (new code = original code + 1). The Reclassify by table (Processing toolbox > Raster analysis > Reclassify by table) tool will be used to reclassify the maps (Fig. 
Step 2
Once the two maps have been reclassified, the next stage is to calculate the spatial metrics for each map: first for the simulation and then for the reference map. This is done using the Landscape statistics option in the ""LecoS"" plugin (Raster > Landscape ecology > Landscape statistics) (Fig. 
In ""Landcover grid"" select the raster for which you want to obtain the spatial metrics. You must also indicate the value of the background (No-data) and its spatial resolution (Cellsize). Finally, select the spatial metrics you are going to calculate.
Several spatial metrics can be selected at the same time using the ""Select multiple metrics"" tab. In this case, we selected the following metrics: Land cover; Landscape  | Results and Comments: Once the spatial metrics for each of the maps have been calculated, the results of the analysis will be stored in CSV files in the folder of your choice. To make it easier to interpret and compare the spatial metrics, the two files must be merged into one. This can be done using a spreadsheet program such as OpenOffice Calc or Microsoft Excel. This will display the results in a table similar to Table 
Even so, some differences can be observed. Agricultural areas (Category 1 after reclassification) and vegetation areas (Category 2) are made up of a larger number of patches in the simulation than in the reference map (Table 
These trends may indicate that the changes simulated as transitions to urban fabric and to industrial and commercial areas have made these classes more compact (patches that were not previously connected have now become connected with the simulated changes). That is, these classes did not grow in an isolated way, but via the expansion of previously existing patches. The slight differences between the reference map and the simulation in the ""Like adjacencies"" and ""Patch cohesion index"" metrics for industrial and commercial areas (Category 4 after reclassification) also point in this direction.
In the process of expansion of urban fabric and industrial areas, some patches of agricultural and vegetation areas could become isolated, so increasing the fragmentation of the category. This would explain why there are more patches in these categories in the simulation than in the reference map.
The difference in pattern between the simulation and the reference map can best be calculated using spreadsheet software, as described in the example for Table 
In our simulation, we did not actively model the vacant classes. Thus, whereas according to the reference map there were many vegetation areas that changed to agricultural areas, in our simulation this did not happen. As a consequence, our simulation has more vegetation areas, but less agricultural areas than the reference map.
The ""Greatest patch area"" metric shows that we did not model one of the biggest industrial developments in the study area correctly. The largest patch in our simulation is 450,000 m 2 smaller than the one in the reference map. The opposite was true in the case of urban fabric. According to the model, many pixels were considered to have changed as a result of the expansion of large pre-existing patches, when this trend was in fact not that strong according to the reference map.
If we focus on the ""Mean patch area"" metric for the two categories we modelled actively (3 and 4) we can see how in both cases the mean area of patches is always bigger in the simulation than in the reference map. This may be due to the same process as in urban fabric, i.e. most of the changes are simulated as expansions of pre-existing large patches.
In all other categories apart from the first 4 (1, 2, 3, 4), there are important differences between the two maps. However, as changes in these categories were not modelled in the simulation (they remained invariant), the differences between the maps are due to changes that took place in the reference map but were not simulated.
To sum up, it is difficult with the information available to us to understand whether the pattern of the changes we simulated is valid or not. We have various clues about the pattern of the changes (more compact and connected than in the reference map), but these trends are best confirmed by visual inspection. Calculating the spatial metrics solely for the areas that changed is also highly recommended and can provide additional insight.
Exercise 3. To validate simulated changes against a reference map of changes | Aim: To assess to what extent the pattern of the changes we simulated is similar to the pattern of a reference map of changes for the same year, which accurately reflects the real situation on the ground. | Materials:  | CORINE Land Use Changes Asturias Central Area 2005-2011 Simulated CORINE changes Asturias Central Area 2005-2011:  | Requisites: The two maps must be raster. The background class must be 0 or no data. For a proper validation, the changes in the reference map must refer to the same time period as the simulation period. | Execution: Step 1
Given that the background is already coded 0 in the two maps charting changes, we do not need to take any preliminary steps prior to calculating the spatial metrics. This can be done directly using the Landscape statistics option in the ""LecoS"" plugin (Raster > Landscape ecology > Landscape statistics).
In the tool, we must indicate the raster for which we want to calculate the spatial metrics (Landcover grid), the value of the background in our maps (No-Data) and their spatial resolution (Fig. 
In this analysis, we will be calculating the following metrics: Land cover; Number of patches; Greatest patch area; Smallest patch area; Mean patch area; Median patch area; Fractal dimension index; Like adjacencies; Patch cohesion index.
Step 2
We repeat this process for the second map. | Results and Comments: Once we have run the tool twice, once for each map, we will have two CSV files with the metrics for each of the change maps. These will be saved in the specified folder.
The reference map of changes includes land use changes for many categories 
The changes we simulated are quantitatively the same as the reference changes (Table 
On the other hand, the pattern of the simulated changes seems to be very different from the pattern of the reference map of changes. In the reference map, the changes took place in just a few patches and most of the pixels that changed are allocated close to each other. In the simulation, the changes are fragmented in many different patches (Table 
When working with Cellular Automata models, change usually takes place organically as an expansion of existing patches. In the real world, however, changes in urban and industrial areas tend to happen at the same time over entire cadastral parcels. Often, these parcels are quite big, comprising a large number of pixels. However, as CA models usually simulate change at the pixel level, they are not normally capable of simulating big patches of change covering large numbers of pixels. Our model therefore behaves differently from the real processes taking place on the ground, hence the disagreements in the pattern of simulated changes.
Other metrics, such as ""Like adjacencies"" and ""Patch cohesion index"" confirm this behaviour. The pixels in the reference map are better grouped than those in the simulated map (Table 
In conclusion, the pattern of changes we simulated is very different to the pattern of changes in the reference map. However, this does not mean that the changes we simulated have altered the pattern of the simulated landscape. On the contrary, as we discovered in the previous exercise, the pattern of the whole landscape remains very similar.
It is important to remember here that we are only calculating the pattern of the areas that changed, without viewing them in any larger context. By contrast, when we calculate the spatial metrics for the whole map, we also consider the context and can therefore assess whether the changes have altered the pattern of the map. Thus, both analyses are complementary. We recommend users to carry out both analyses when validating the pattern of their simulations.
Finally, a qualitative validation through visual inspection is highly recommended for contextualizing the results and understanding them better.  | Requisites: The two maps must be raster. The background class must be 0 or no data. | Execution: Step 1
In order to comply with the requirements of the ""LecoS"" plugin, the maps must be reclassified to ensure that the background code is 0 and all other categories have a positive code different from 0. This is done using the Reclassify by table tool (Processing toolbox > Raster analysis > Reclassify by table) (Fig. 
After opening the tool, we indicate the map we want to reclassify and then fill in the ""Reclassification table"" with the new category codes that will replace the existing ones in the raster (Fig. 
Step 2
Once the categories have been reclassified, the spatial metrics for each map can be calculated using the Landscape statistics option in the ""LecoS"" plugin (Raster > Landscape ecology > Landscape statistics) (Fig. 
After opening the tool, we select the raster for which we wish to obtain the metrics (Landcover grid), the background value of the raster (No-Data) and its spatial resolution (cellsize). We then select the different metrics we want to calculate in the ""Select multiple metrics"" tab. In this case we selected the following: Land cover; Landscape proportion; Number of patches; Greatest patch area; Smallest patch area; Mean patch area; Median patch area; Fractal dimension index; Like adjacencies; Patch cohesion index. | Results and Comments: After running the tool, the metrics are displayed in two CSV files which are saved in the specified folder.  The metrics reveal important differences between the two maps in terms of landscape configuration, i.e. the way land uses are allocated on each map.
The categories in the CORINE 2011 map are made up of many more patches than the same categories in the CORINE 2005 map (Table 
The ""Like adjacencies"" and ""Patch cohesion index"" metrics also show slight differences between the maps. This is unusual when comparing a time series of land use maps, as these metrics are not usually sensitive to small changes in the landscape. With the exception of highly dynamic environments, in most of the study areas we might wish to assess, change affects less than 5% of the landscape. We should not therefore expect meaningful differences in the spatial metrics that characterize the landscape over a short period such as that used in our example 
The ""Land cover"" metrics show big differences between the maps in terms of the areas covered by each category (Table 
The ""Greatest patch area"" and ""Mean patch area"" metrics also differ greatly for the two maps in the time series (Table 
These conclusions were confirmed by a visual inspection of the two maps, an additional check that is highly recommended to complement the results of this analysis.
Exercise 5. To validate a series of maps with two or more time points (vector) | Aim: To study the pattern of a specific transition (from scrubland to forest) in our study area (Ari√®ge Valley) for a given period  | Materials:  | CORINE Land Cover Map Val d'Ari√®ge 2000 CORINE Land Cover Map Val d'Ari√®ge 2018:  | Requisites: All raster maps must have the same resolution, extent and projection. | Execution: Step 1
We begin by extracting the changes we want to study (transition from scrub to forest) with the Raster Calculator (Fig. 
This produces a raster showing the areas that underwent this transition (Fig. 
Step 2
Once the raster for this transition has been obtained, it must be converted into vector format (polygons) using the Polygonize GDAL tool. When making this conversion, the ""Use 8-connectedness"" option must be selected (Fig. 
Step 3
Once the polygons that undergo this transition have been obtained in vector format, we can then calculate their spatial metrics using the SAGA Polygon Shape Indices tool (Fig. 
Step 4
In order to better interpret the general pattern of all the polygons that undergo this transition, the results of the metrics can be exported to a spreadsheet where statistics such as the mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum can be calculated (Table  | Results and Comments: The pattern of the areas that transition from scrubland 
The perimeter / area (P/A) ratio is a measure of the compactness of the patches. Lower P/A values mean more compact polygons, whereas higher P/A values mean elongated or less compact polygons. The maximum distance metric indicates the longest segment of a polygon. The maximum distance / area (D/A) ratio is a measure of how Lower values indicate more compact, less elongated polygons, whereas higher values mean the opposite. Finally, the shape index measures the shape complexity of a patch, using the following formula: Perimeter/(2 * Square Root(PI * Area).
The metrics calculated in this exercise can be compared with the metrics obtained and analysed in Exercise 6 below, which carries out the same analysis with raster data. The comparison will offer an insight into how data format (vector or raster) can affect the results of a pattern analysis. Exercise 6. To validate a series of maps with two or more time points (raster) | Aim: To study the pattern of a specific transition (scrub into forest) in our study area (Ari√®ge Valley) for a given period  | Requisites: All maps must be rasters and have the same resolution, extent and projection. | Execution: Step 1
We begin by extracting the specific changes we want to study from our series of maps, i.e. the pixels that transitioned from scrub (Category 4) to forest (Category 3). We do this by introducing the following expression in the Raster Calculator: ""CLC_2000@1"" = 4 AND ""CLC_2018@1"" = 3 (Fig. 
Step 2
Once the raster with the areas that changed from scrub to forest has been obtained, we then calculate their spatial metrics using the Landscape statistics option from the ""LecoS"" plugin (Raster > Landscape ecology > Landscape statistics) (Fig.  | Results and Comments: Once the spatial metrics have been calculated, the plugin creates a CSV file in the output folder with the results.  The results show that 37 different patches underwent the transition from scrub to forest, as shown in the ""Number of patches"" metric in Table 
The ""Landscape proportion"" metric indicates the percentage of the studied landscape occupied by the category in question. As we are only considering one category in our analysis (the areas that transition from scrubland to forests), this category occupies 100% of the studied landscape and therefore has a landscape proportion value of 1 (Table 
The landscape division, patch cohesion and splitting indices assess the compactness or fragmentation of the patches that make up a class, i.e. how well aggregated they are. A ""Landscape division"" value close to 1 means a very fragmented landscape, whereas values close to 0 indicate a landscape made up of a single patch. A ""Patch cohesion"" value of 0 means one isolated patch, whereas values closer to 100 mean more aggregated patches. A ""Splitting index"" value of 1 indicates a landscape made up of a single patch, while splitting index values of more than 1 indicate a progressively more fragmented landscape.
If we compare these results to those obtained in vector format (Exercise 5), we can see that the same values were obtained for comparable measures (e.g. mean area, greatest / smallest area), while other measures use different formulas. These include the shape and compacity indices (standardized or not, area-weighted or not, completed by a constant or not). The LecoS plugin also offers complementary indices which are not calculated in vector format, such as the fractal dimension or the splitting index. In addition, whereas the spatial metrics in vector can be calculated individually for each patch or polygon (Exercise 5), this is not possible in raster format when using the LecoS plugin. The plugin usually calculates the mean values of all the patches for each metric.

Garc√≠a-√Ålvarez and M. Paegelow | Advanced Pattern Analysis to Validate Land Use Cover Maps: Martin Paegelow and David Garc√≠a-√Ålvarez | Abstract: In this chapter we explore pattern analysis for categorical LUC maps as a means of validating land use cover maps, land change and land change simulations. In addition to those described in Chap. ""Spatial Metrics to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"", we present three complementary methods and techniques: a Goodness of Fit metric to measure the agreement between two maps in terms of pattern (Map Curves), the focus on changes on pattern borders as a method for validating on-border processes and a technique quantifying the magnitude of distance error. Map Curves (Sect. 1) offers a universal pattern-based index, called Goodness of Fit (GOF), which measures the spatial concordance between categorical rasters or vector layers.
Complementary to this pattern validation metric, the following Sect. 2 focuses specifically on the changes that take place on pattern borders. This enables changes to be divided into those that take place on the borders of existing features and those that form new, disconnected features. Bringing this chapter on landscape patterns to a close, Sect. 3 presents a technique for quantifying allocation errors in simulation maps and more precisely on the minimum distance between the allocation errors in simulation maps and the nearest patch belonging to the same category on the reference map. The comparison between a raster-based and a vector-based approach brings us back to the differences in measurement inherent in the representation of entities in raster and vector mode. These techniques are applied to two datasets. Section 1 uses the Asturias Central Area database, where CORINE maps are compared to SIOSE maps and simulation outputs. For their part, the techniques described in Sects. 2 and 3 are applied to the Ari√®ge Valley database. CORINE maps for 2000 and 2018 are used as reference maps in comparisons with simulated land covers. | Keywords: Allocation distance error √Å Change on pattern borders √Å Map Curves √Å Pattern shape and size indices | Map Curves: Description This is a quantitative method proposed by 
GOF values range from 0 to 1. Maximum GOF ( 
When comparing pairs of maps, the GOF value may vary depending on whether the assessed map is evaluated against the reference map or the reference map is evaluated against the assessed map. Map Curves calculates the GOF values for both these operations. It then uses the highest of these two GOF values in the comparison.
GOF values may be obtained either for the whole dataset or for the set of patches or polygons that make up each category on the map. Although it is technically possible to calculate a GOF for each individual polygon or patch, it is computationally very demanding and is not normally done.
Based on the GOF metrics at the category level, the results of the map comparison may be expressed in a graph, which shows the percentage of the categories in the map that have a specific GOF value. For example, if there are 10 categories and 2 of these have a GOF value of ! 0.8, the graph will show that 20% of the categories have GOF values of ! 0.8. | Utility: Exercises 1. To validate a map against reference data/map 2. To validate a simulation against a reference map 3. To validate simulated changes against a reference map of changes 4. To validate a series of maps with two or more time points Map Curves provides a simple metric for assessing the extent to which two datasets share the same spatial structure, i.e. the same number and shape of polygons or patches. Unlike many other metrics, GOF evaluates the spatial agreement between maps at a polygon or patch level. In most cases, this type of analysis is based on raster data and comparisons are made at cell level. However, polygons or patches reflect the real structure of a landscape better than cells. GOF therefore provides a better, more realistic method for validating the similarity between maps than cell-based metrics.
GOF provides a standard and, therefore, comparable metric. The GOF value in one validation exercise may be compared with the GOF value obtained in another. Consequently, when using this metric to assess validity, we can establish a general minimum acceptable GOF threshold above which the map can be considered valid.
Map Curves gives an overview of the pattern agreement for the whole landscape and at category level. However, it does not provide information about the agreement per polygon. This means that a few polygons that do not show good overlap when comparing the maps could be hidden in the general analysis. Thus, as currently implemented, this technique only provides information on spatial agreement at a category level and does not shed light on disagreements occurring at more detailed scales of analysis.
The fact that GOF is unaffected by the spatial resolution used in the analysis should be considered an important strength, as spatial resolution is one of the main sources of uncertainty associated with any validation exercise. Nonetheless, at very coarse spatial resolutions, the area and shape of some polygons and patches can become very distorted, and this could affect the results of the analysis. Therefore, when used with rasters, GOF can be considered independent of spatial resolution below a certain threshold.
We do not recommend validating the spatial structure of a map by comparing it with another map obtained at a different resolution. Changes in spatial resolution or scale will always result in changes in the spatial structure of the maps. The results of the analysis will highlight not only the differences between the original maps in the way they represent LUC in the landscape, but also the differences produced by changes in the spatial resolution.
Although Map Curves could be a useful tool for comparing the agreement of the spatial pattern between different maps, its results must be treated with caution when validating the pattern of the maps. This is because Map Curves only assesses the degree of overlap between the patches or polygons belonging to each category in the two maps compared. If the overlap is low, the GOF score obtained by Map Curves analysis will also be low. However, this only means that their classes do not overlap well and does not imply that the two maps being compared have completely different patterns.
Spatial metrics (see Chap. ""Spatial Metrics to Validate Land Use Cover Maps"") are more suitable for validating the pattern of the map. Even if there is no spatial overlap, they provide objective information about the fragmentation of the landscape or the complexity of the polygons/patches, which can be used when comparing two maps. Spatial metrics therefore allow us to compare pattern agreement between maps, even if they do not locate land uses in the same positions. | QGIS Exercises: Available tools
There is no default tool in QGIS for carrying out Map Curves analysis. It is however implemented in R. We have developed two R tools for QGIS to perform the Map Curves analysis for either raster or vector data. To learn how to configure QGIS to work with R scripts, see Chap. ""About This Book"" of this book. This also explains how to install the different R scripts required to do some of the exercises presented in the book. The Map Curves raster script is based on the code developed by Professor Emiel van Loon from the University of Amsterdam. 
The Map Curves vector script, which can only be employed to compare vector maps, is based on the ""Sabre"" R package. 
The Map Curves raster script provides more information than the Map Curves vector script. It is also much faster and more efficient. We therefore recommend that this analysis be carried out with raster data.
Exercise 1. To validate a map against reference data/map | Aim: To check the agreement between the SIOSE and CORINE maps, considering SIOSE as a valid reference. We will assess to what extent the spatial structure of the CORINE map (number of polygons, shape) is similar to the SIOSE map. | Materials:  | SIOSE Land Use Map Asturias Central Area 2011 CORINE Land Use Map Asturias Central Area 2011:  | Requisites: The two maps must be raster and have the same projection. Although the tool does work with raster maps at different extents and with different thematic resolutions, we recommend comparing rasters with the same or very similar extents and thematic resolutions, so as to avoid results that may not be particularly meaningful. | Execution: If necessary, install the Processing R provider plugin, and download the MapCurves_raster.rsx R script into the R scripts folder (processing/rscripts). For more details, see Chap. ""About This Book"" of this book.
Step 1
Open the Map Curves Raster function and fill in the required parameters. These are basically the two LUC maps to be compared: ""Land Use map 1"" (SIOSE) and ""Land Use map 2"" (CORINE) (Fig.  | Results and Comments: After running the function, we obtain two tables and one graph. All the information, with the exception of the graph, will also be displayed in the ""Log"" window (Fig. 
The GOF value is a measure of the general agreement between the two maps being compared. This value ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 meaning no agreement and 1 total agreement. The GOF value for our comparison (0.54) indicates that the agreement between the two maps is significant, although not very high. The patches of the same categories partially overlap.
The reference map ($Refmap) value informs us as to which map was used as the reference when obtaining the GOF value. If value ""A"" is obtained, it means that ""Land use map 1"" was used as the reference map in the comparison. If value ""B"" appears, it means that ""Land use map 2"" was used. Therefore, in our case, a GOF of 0.54 was obtained when comparing SIOSE and CORINE and taking CORINE as the reference. If SIOSE had been taken as the reference, agreement (GOF value) would have been lower.
The GOF table details the GOF value for agreement per category, so providing a measure of how similar the pattern for a particular category is in the two maps. It therefore answers the following question: to what extent do the patches that make up a particular category overlap in the two maps being compared?
In our case, the category that shows the greatest pattern agreement between the two maps is water bodies (Category 11), with a GOF value of 0.968. Agricultural areas (Category 0; GOF 0.783) and vegetation areas (Category 1; GOF 0.800) also show high levels of agreement. By contrast, agreement between the two maps is very low for road and rail networks (Category 6; GOF 0.112).
If we observe the two maps, most of the agreement and disagreement is due to the fact that they follow different Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) and Minimum Mapping Width (MMW) criteria. Thus, if a patch is larger than the MMU and MMW of both maps, it will be similarly mapped in both cases. However, if a patch is drawn in SIOSE, but is too small for the MMU and MMW of CORINE, this will lead to disagreement between the two maps.
This explains the results for Category 6 (road and rail networks). Whereas many patches representing road and rail networks are mapped in SIOSE, most of them are not mapped in CORINE because they are less than 100 m wide and therefore do not comply with its MMW criterion (Fig. 
In this exercise, the GOF values for the different categories did not indicate a high degree of similarity between the category patterns on the two maps. On the contrary, they indicated different patterns of fragmentation for each category because of the different MMU and MMW rules applied in each map.
In addition to the overall GOF and the GOF table detailing the GOF agreement per category, the Map Curves function also produces two extra tables: the $BMC_A2B and the $BMC_B2A (Fig. 
Unlike the other two tables, these tables are only displayed in the ""Log"" window and are not stored in any folder. For each category, they indicate the category with which it shows most agreement (GOF) on the other map. Whereas, the information in the first table ($BMC_A2B) was obtained using map A (Land use map 1) as the reference, the reach or exceed a specific GOF threshold. Thus, all the categories (100%) always have a GOF score higher than 0. However, only around 40% of the categories in this map have a GOF score of over 0.5 and none of the categories show perfect agreement (0% of the categories have a GOF score of 1) (Fig. 
The graph provides the GOF scores using either Land use map 1 (A) or Land use map 2 (B) as a reference. It is therefore a good summary of the pattern agreement between the two maps.
In summary, in this exercise we have noted that although the GOF value is not very high, CORINE has a very similar pattern to SIOSE. The lower GOF is the result of different pattern fragmentation in the two maps: SIOSE maps have many small patches that do not appear in CORINE. However, if we look at the maps, the polygons from the same category usually overlap very well and have a similar pattern structure. In addition, thematic agreement, as we noted in the $BMC_A2B and $BMC_B2A tables, seems to be very high.  | Aim: To assess the similarity between the spatial structure of a simulation and the spatial structure of a map used as a reference. | Materials: Simulation CORINE Asturias Central Area 2011 CORINE Land Use Map Asturias Central Area 2011 | Requisites: The two maps must be raster and have the same projection. Although the tool works with raster maps at different extents and with different thematic resolutions, we recommend that raster maps with the same or very similar extents and thematic resolutions be compared so as to avoid results that may be not fully informative. For a proper validation, the reference map must be for the same year as the simulation. | Execution: If necessary, install the Processing R provider plugin and download the MapCurves_raster.rsx R script into the R scripts folder (processing/rscripts). For more details, see Chap. ""About This Book"".
Step 1
Open the Map Curves Raster function and fill in the required parameters: ""Land Use map 1"" (CORINE simulation) and ""Land Use map 2"" (CORINE reference map) (Fig.  | Results and Comments: After running the tool, a GOF value was obtained for the whole maps compared and broken down per pair of classes (GOF table ). The GOF values are stored in different tables and displayed in the ""Log"" window ($GOF, $GOFtable). The GOF values per pair of classes are also represented in the Map Curves graph, which is stored in the specified folder (R Plots).
The GOF value for our comparison is very high (0.92). This is logical given that most of the simulated landscape did not change over the simulation period and, therefore, remained the same. Permanence is one of the easiest processes to simulate in LUC modelling. This means that the reference and the simulated maps look very similar. The patterns of the two maps are very similar because most of the pattern remains unchanged over the simulation period and was correctly simulated as such.
The agreement (GOF) per category was always very high. The minimum scores were for port areas (0.669) and mineral extraction sites (0.708). In the modelling exercise, these categories were treated as features (categories that remained invariant during the simulation) and were therefore not simulated. However, a few changes did in fact occur in these categories in the reference map. As a result, the Map Curves analysis produced a relatively poor fit for these categories when comparing the simulation with the reference map. Whereas no change occurred in these categories in the simulation, a few changes did take place in the reference map. Given that these categories consist of a very small number of patches, even a small number of changes can reduce the GOF values substantially.
All in all, this analysis is not particularly meaningful. It confirms that the two compared maps have very similar patterns because most of the landscape was correctly simulated as permanence. However, more meaningful results could be obtained by focusing exclusively on the areas that were simulated as change. Hence, for a proper validation of the simulation, the simulated changes must be compared with the changes observed on the reference maps.
Exercise 3. To validate simulated changes against a reference map of changes | Aim: To evaluate how similar the changes we simulated in our modelling exercise are to those observed on the reference map. | Materials:  | CORINE Land Use Changes Asturias Central Area 2005-2011 Simulated CORINE changes Asturias Central Area 2005-2011:  | Requisites: The two maps must be raster and have the same projection. Although the tool does work with raster maps at different extents and with different thematic resolutions, we recommend comparing rasters with the same or very similar extents and thematic resolutions, so as to avoid results that may not be very meaningful. For a proper validation, the simulation and the reference map must refer to the same time period. In both cases, the maps must only display the changes that occurred during the study period, showing all other areas as 0 or some other suitable code. | Execution: If necessary, install the Processing R provider plugin and download the MapCurves_raster.rsx R script into the R scripts folder (processing/rscripts). For more details, see Chap. ""About This Book"".
Step 1
Open the Map Curves Raster function and fill in the required parameters: ""Land Use map 1"" (Simulated CORINE changes) and ""Land Use map 2"" (CORINE changes) (Fig.  | Results and Comments: After running the function, we get the overall GOF ($GOF) value, the GOF value per category ($GOFtable) and the Map Curves graph (R Plots). In this case, the only results that might be useful for interpreting the validity of the simulated changes are the results per category.
The general GOF value is 0.3, but this is artificially high due to the almost perfect overlap of class 0 (areas with no change) which has a GOF value of 0.993 (Table 
The spatial overlap between these two categories in the two maps is very low. The GOF value for urban fabric (Category 3 in the maps) is only 0.05. In the case of industrial and commercial maps (Category 4) it is even lower: 0.039.
This means that the spatial structure of the simulated changes is very different to that of the changes used as a reference for the same period. Thus, even though the Map Curves analysis for the whole simulation (persistence and changes) obtained good results, the simulated changes overlap poorly with the changes mapped in the reference data.
We cannot draw final conclusions about the different patterns of simulated and reference changes. Even if there is no overlap between them, their shape or fragmentation could be similar. For a clearer picture of these aspects, other tools, such as spatial metrics, must be used (see Chap.  | Requisites: The two maps must be raster and have the same projection. It is also recommended that they have similar extents and thematic resolutions. | Execution: If necessary, install the Processing R provider plugin and download the MapCurves_raster.rsx R script into the R scripts folder (processing/rscripts). For more details, see Chap. ""About This Book"".
Step 1
Open the Map Curves Raster function and fill in the required parameters: ""Land Use map 1"" (CORINE 2005) and ""Land Use map 2"" (CORINE 2011) (Fig.  | Results and Comments: The results show the level of overall agreement between the pair of maps compared ($GOF), the agreement per category ($GOFtable), the best matches between categories ($BMC_A2B, $BMC_B2A) and the Map Curves graph (R plots). All results are displayed in the ""Log"" window and stored in the preselected folders. The overall agreement between our maps is 0.5, which is not high. This means that there is only partial overlap between the categories in the two maps. In a series of two or more Land Use maps, persistence is the norm and one would expect almost perfect overlap between the maps for most of the landscape. Landscapes must be very dynamic to experience changes affecting more than 10% of the study area.
The Asturias Central Area is not a dynamic landscape of this kind. The low GOF score therefore suggests that a lot of the differences between the two maps are due to technical changes or errors.
When agreement was assessed at the category level, the only very high values were for water bodies (Category 11), with a GOF of 0.961 (Fig. 
The agricultural areas (0.709), vegetation areas (0.704) and airports (0.778) show a high level of agreement between the two maps. However, there are still important differences between them that cannot be explained solely by the normal land use dynamism of the study area, in which only small changes usually take place. For all the other categories, agreement is low or very low. Nonetheless, there is no evidence of systematic confusion between one category on the first map and a different category on the second. This is confirmed by the tables showing the best matches between categories (Fig. 
The low agreement or overlap between the categories in the two maps is also summarized in the Map Curves graph (Fig. 
All in all, we can conclude that the time series we assessed has many errors and uncertainties and is therefore affected by many erroneous or spurious changes. These are changes that did not really happen on the ground and arose due to technical reasons, such as different production methods. In a coherent time series of LUC maps, high GOF scores of 0.9 or over would be expected.
The low agreement in our exercise is due to the change in the methodology used to produce the Spanish CORINE Land Cover maps between 2006 and 2011. The CORINE 2005 map (v.00) used in this exercise was obtained using photointerpretation of satellite imagery. However, from 2011 onwards the CORINE maps were obtained by generalizing more detailed Land Use maps (SIOSE). This change in the production method resulted in LUC maps with important differences from their predecessors. In order to solve this problem, the Copernicus service produced another CORINE map for 2005 in Spain according to the new methodology, which was consistent and comparable with the CORINE 2011 map. This more recent version of the CORINE 2005 map is the one normally used in the different exercises of this book. | Change on Pattern Borders:  | Description: In pairs of maps or time series, this technique is used to identify the changes taking place on the edges of patches. The allocation of changes (on the edge of an existing patch or a new disconnected one) provides useful information about the nature of change dynamics: the expanding or shrinking of existing boundaries or the appearance of new land use patches. | Utility: Exercises 1. To validate a series of maps with two or more time points By detecting the changes taking place on the edges of the patches, we can assess both the type of landscape dynamics taking place and the data errors resulting from different data sources, classifiers or spectral responses.  For the sake of simplicity, we will only be presenting the tools used in this exercise, although we are aware that there are many other tools that could be used to carry out this analysis.
Exercise 1. To validate a series of maps with two or more time points | Aim: To focus on gains taking place on the edges of patches for a specific land use/cover category. We can then assess the proportion of change taking place on the edges of existing patches compared to the change that appears in new, disconnected areas.  | Materials:  | Requisites: All maps must be rasters and have the same resolution, extent and projection. | Execution: Step 1
First, we extract forests in 2000 (Fig. 
We then vectorize the binary raster maps computed in Step 1 using the Polygonize Raster Conversion function with no specific parameters.
Step 3
We now isolate the forest gains on the edge of the pattern. The aim is to distinguish between new areas of forest in 2018 (i.e. that did not exist in 2000) which are contiguous with forests that existed in 2000 and others that are not. For this purpose, we use the Extract by location Vector Selection tool with the 'touch' operator (Fig. 
Figure 
Step 4
In this step we will isolate the new forests that are not connected to forests that existed in 2000. This step is optional insofar as new forest patches not connected to forests that existed in 2000 can be obtained simply by subtracting new connected forests from the total area for new forests.
To get an independent layer of new forest in 2018 that is not connected to forests that existed in 2000, we use the same Extract by location tool, opting this time for the 'disjoint' operator 
The next step is to calculate the area covered by new connected/unconnected forests. We use the Vector table Field Calculator tool to create a new attribute called area_ha (decimal number), selecting the $area operator, divided by 10,000 to calculate the area in ha (Fig. 
Step 6
Of the various tools available to summarize the characteristics of the assessed patches, we use the Basic statistics for fields vector analysis tool. On the left of Fig. 
As can be seen in Table  | Utility: Exercises 1. To validate a simulation against a reference map (vector) 2. To validate a simulation against a reference map (raster) Simulation accuracy can be measured in different ways, such as quantity agreement, allocation agreement, landscape structure agreement, etc.  | QGIS Exercises: Available tools GRASS and SAGA toolboxes offer several algorithms for measuring the distance inside a raster grid (r.grow.distance; SAGA distance) or the minimum distance between pixels/patches belonging to two different grid layers (r.distance). Their use inside QGIS may be unstable.
Vector analysis tools require converting raster layers into vector format and then calculate the centroids of the polygons obtained. The Distance to nearest centre (points) tool creates a points layer whose table contains minimum distances between the points in one layer to the nearest point in the second layer.
Both tools (raster and vector) are used in the next two exercises because they provide complementary results.
Exercise 1. To validate a simulation against a reference map (vector)  | Aim: To calculate the seriousness (degree) of allocation errors for a specific LUC category, expressed as the minimum mean distance between all the pixels wrongly allocated to this category in the simulation and the nearest patch belonging to the same category on the reference map.  | Requisites: Maps can be raster or vector. They must have the same resolution, extent and projection. If using vector maps, readers can skip the first steps detailed in the execution. | Execution: Step 1
We extract real built-up areas in 2018 (Fig. 
The right map (A) in Fig. 
Step 2
The two raster layers obtained in Step 1 are now polygonized into vector layers. This is done using the Polygonize function in the Raster-Conversion menu (Fig. 
The above map (Fig. 
Step 3
We then calculate the centroids for each of these vector layers with the Centroids tool (Vector-Geometric tools) (Fig. 
Step 4
Once we have obtained the two centroids maps (built-up areas in 2018 and built-up allocation errors), we use the Distance to nearest hub (points) tool available in the Processing Toolbox (QGIS Vector). The source points layer is the point layer containing allocation errors and the destination hubs layer is the layer containing the built-up centroids from the reference map (Fig. 
To obtain the desired statistics about the allocation error distance for wrongly simulated built-up areas, we use the Basic statistics for fields tool (Processing Toolbox, Vectoranalysis) by selecting the field containing the calculated distance to the nearest hub (Fig.  | Results and Comments: The resulting points layer contains the same number of points as the allocation error polygons at the same location.
The corresponding table contains the minimum distance between each allocation error (centroid) and the nearest existing built-up area (centroid) on the reference map (Fig. 
A summary of the statistics appears in the log of the Basic statistics for fields function (Fig. 
As we can see, the mean distance for 132 allocation errors is about 1,236 m. This is quite close to the median value 
The mean allocation error distance of about 1.2 km should be put into context by comparing it with the spatial extent of the layer, which is about 31 √Ç 62 km. It may also be useful to compare this value with the mean allocation error distances for other LUC categories and the mean value for all the allocation errors.  | Requisites: All maps must be rasters and have the same resolution, extent and projection. | Execution: Step 1
First, we compute a raster distance map up from built-up areas using the QGIS raster function Proximity (Fig. 
The values obtained in this exercise differ greatly from those obtained in Exercise 1. During Exercise 1 we calculated the distances between the centroids of polygons. This may result in longer distances than those generated by the technique used in Exercise 2, which measures the mean or minimum distance. The two techniques can produce different results, depending on the number, the extent and the shape of the features being analysed.

Overall accuracy is expressed as the proportion of the map that has been correctly classified. User's accuracy indicates the probability that a pixel from a specific category on the classified map correctly represents the real situation on the ground or reference map. Producer's accuracy indicates the probability that a reference pixel belonging to a specific category has been correctly allocated to that category 
GWR is a statistical technique in which regression points are estimated on the basis of the spatial distribution of data points. A moving window analyses the data points it collects to estimate the coefficients of the selected regression point. This window, or kernel, weights each data point according to the distance within the window and the assigned weighting function (gaussian, exponential, bisquare, tricube, boxcar). Its maximum weighting value is 1 and this decreases as the distance between the observation and calibration data points increases. The size of the kernel is defined by the bandwidth, which indicates the number of data points that will be included in the local calculation for each regression point. This can consider either a fixed or a variable number of reference data points. If a fixed number of points are considered, a specific number will be obtained, while in the case of a variable number, a distance value is given. The number of reference data points therefore varies according to their distribution. It is important to select a suitable bandwidth so as to minimise the cross-validation prediction error. According to 
where b 0 is the intercept, b n is the coefficient, x n is the value of the explanatory variable, and u i ; v i are the coordinates of the data point (Fig. 
This geographically weighted method was adapted for the calculation of local accuracy assessment statistics by 
where P(A = 1) is the probability that the agreement between the classified data and the reference data is equal to 1. This value is 0 when there is no agreement and 1 when there is agreement.
To estimate user's accuracy, it is necessary to analyse the reference data against the classified data. This metric indicates the probability that the reference LUC class y i and is correctly predicted by the classified data x i . | User's accuracy: To estimate producer's accuracy, it is necessary to analyse the classified data against reference data. This indicates the probability that the classified data x i correctly represents reference LUC class y i . Finally, in order to obtain the accuracy values, the coefficients have to be adjusted. To this end, the coefficients are added together, and an alogit function (inverse logit) is applied. | Producer's accuracy:  | Utility: Exercises 1. To validate a map against reference data/map Geographically Weighted methods can be used to validate single LUC maps by analysing spatial variations in the agreement between reference data and classified remotely sensed data, so enabling us to analyse the spatial non-stationarity of LUC data error and accuracy. They allow to explore the spatial relationships between the reference data and the classified data, exposing possible clusters of land cover errors, and reporting the values for each data point in contrast to global accuracy assessment statistics, which only provide a global value for the entire map.
This technique allows us not only to discover what proportion of the map has been correctly classified but also to estimate in which areas the classification fits best and to analyse possible trends that are only visible spatially. In this way, the spatial distribution of the overall, user's and producer's accuracy metrics can be visualized on a map so as to enable a better understanding of classification uncertainty. the University of Leicester, | QGIS Exercise: First, to estimate local OA values, the tool calculates internally, for each data point, the agreement between the reference data and the classified data, where 0 represents disagreement and 1 represents agreement. Agreement is automatically selected as dependent variable [y] and ""1"" is selected as independent variable [x], where P(A = 1) is the probability that agreement is equal to 1.
To estimate local UA values, the tool generates a new data frame and obtains two columns. One column shows the presence (1)/absence (0) of the chosen category for the reference data, while the other column shows the same for the classified data. The reference data (RD) is selected as dependent variable [y], and the classified data (CD) is selected as independent variable [x], where P(RD = 1|CD = 1). The procedure for producer's accuracy is very similar. The classified data for the chosen category is selected as dependent variable [y], and the reference data is selected as independent variable [x], where P(CD = 1|RD = 1).
In order to ensure that the tool works correctly, various parameters must be configured. Selecting an appropriate bandwidth is therefore crucial. A small bandwidth would include too few data points in the local sample, making it unreliable for calibrating the model, while a large bandwidth would include too many data points, so reducing the local analysis capacity. A spatially distributed data sample is also required.
The fact that the parameters must be configured and the need for more in-depth knowledge to interpret the results could be considered a disadvantage when choosing these validation methods. Another important consideration is that using large data samples can lead to long runtimes.
Exercise 1. To validate a map against reference data/map Aim To assess the spatial variation of accuracy assessment measures (overall, user's and producer's accuracy) when validating the Marqu√©s de Comillas LUC map against a reference set of points. | Materials:  | Marqu√©s de Comillas random sample points from Mexico (2019) Boundary of Marques de Comillas:  | Requisites: The data points must be projected in their corresponding reference system. The vector point file must include two attributes, one corresponding to reference LUC data and one to classified LUC data. It is recommended that the data points have an appropriate random distribution. Sample size should not be overly large, as this could lead to long runtimes. | Execution: If necessary, install the Processing R provider plugin, and download the Local accuracy assessment statistics.rsx R script into the R scripts folder (processing/ rscripts). For more details, see chapter ""About This Book"" of this book.
Step 1
Open the Local accuracy assessment statistics function and fill in the required parameters (see Fig. 
Step 2
The parameter configuration for calculating User's Accuracy is very similar. Select the corresponding accuracy assessment statistic in the ""Accuracy"" option (""User"") and the category you want to assess in the ""Category"" option, (see Fig. 
Step 3
To estimate the producer's accuracy values, the same steps must be followed (see Fig. 
Step 4
Finally, the coefficients adjusted by the Local accuracy assessment statistics tool were interpolated using the Inverse Distance Weighted method (IDW interpolation tool in QGIS) (see Fig. 
The names of the column or attribute obtained as a result of applying the tool and indicating the local overall, user's and producer's accuracy values are ""g__SDF_"", ""coefs_u"" and ""coefs_p"" respectively. This column must be specified in the ""Interpolation attribute"" option in line with the accuracy metric being analysed.
Step 5
As an additional, optional step, the raster images obtained by interpolation can be clipped by mask using the Marques de Comillas boundary (Clip raster by mask layer tool in QGIS) in order to provide a better visual representation. In addition, a discrete colour scale using six classes was chosen in order to make interpretation of the data more straightforward. | Results and Comments: After the execution of the previous steps, we obtain a new attribute column with the estimated local values for OA, UA and PA respectively, and the interpolated distribution maps for these accuracy measures. Another output of the tool is a new layer that includes the estimated Overall Accuracy value for each data point. In addition, a summary of the local and overall values calculated is displayed in the log window (Fig. 
The IDW interpolation method is used to generate an area that visually represents the distribution of the values obtained, offering a more detailed spatial representation of the distribution of accuracy and error than that provided by a single overall accuracy value. Figure 
Figure 
The last part of this exercise focuses on Producer's Accuracy. In this case, it describes omission errors related to the tropical rain forest class. User's accuracy varies from 0.56 to 0.89 (variation of 0.33), despite the global value for the entire area of 0.74 (Fig. 
Figure 
Producer's accuracy has the highest range of variation, with User's accuracy close behind. By contrast, Overall accuracy has a relatively small range, indicating low levels of spatial variation. Despite this, the maximum Overall accuracy value (0.84) is below the value proposed by 
In conclusion, Local accuracy assessment statistics should be considered as a useful complement to the cross-tabulation matrix and its global accuracy statistics in that they provide more detailed information that can help improve classification techniques by locating possible error clusters with greater precision. It is also important to stress that a visual interpretation can enable better decisions to be taken when evaluating and validating LUC maps.

This chapter only reviews those datasets available for one single date, which have not been updated over time. Seven different datasets are described in detail. Two other ones were identified, but are not included in this review, because of its coarsens, which limits their utility: Mathews Global Vegetation/Land Use and GMRCA LULC. The first experiences in global LUC mapping date back to the 1990s, when leading research groups in the field produced the first global LUC maps at fine scales of 1 km spatial resolution: the UMD LC Classification and the Global Land Cover Characterization. Not long afterwards, in an attempt to build on these experiences and take them a stage further, an international partnership produced GLC2000 for the reference year 2000. These initial LUC mapping projects produced maps for just one reference year and were not continued or updated over time. Subsequent projects have mostly focused on the production of timeseries of global LUC maps, which allow us to study LUC change over time (see Chapter ""Global General Land Use Cover Datasets with a Time Series of Maps""). As a result, there are relatively few single-date global LUC maps for recent years of reference. The latest projects and initiatives producing global LUC maps for single dates have focused on improving the accuracy of global LUC mapping and the use of crowdsourcing production strategies. The Geo-Wiki Hybrid and GLC-SHARE datasets built on the previous research in a bid to obtain more accurate global LUC maps by merging the data from existing datasets. OSM LULC is an ongoing test project that is trying to produce a global LUC map cheaply, using crowdsourced information provided by the Open Street Maps community. The other dataset reviewed here is the LADA LUC Map, which was developed for a specific thematic project (Land Degradation Assessment in Dryland). This dataset is not comparable to the others reviewed in this chapter in terms of its purpose and nature, as is clear from its coarse spatial resolution (5 arc minutes). We therefore believe that this dataset should not be considered part of initiatives to produce more accurate, more detailed land use maps at a global level. | Project: The Department of Geography of the University of Maryland hosted one of the first research groups to use the classification of satellite imagery for global LUC mapping. They initially produced an LUC map at a spatial resolution of 1 degree for the year of reference 1987. This was followed sometime later by the production of a finer map at 8 km for 1984. Finally, the project delivered a map at 1 km, which at that time was the finest resolution at which global LUC mapping had ever been carried out.
The Global Land Cover Facility that hosted all this data recently went offline. This means that there is currently no official website that supports the datasets and provides information about their particular specifications. The map at 1 km can however be downloaded from external sites. The earlier maps at coarser resolutions are no longer available. | Production method: The UMD LC was obtained through supervised classification with a decision tree algorithm of imagery captured by the AVHRR sensor. Urban and built-up areas were not mapped, nor were water covers. Instead, they were extracted from auxiliary sources. The classification obtained in this way was then improved in a post-classification stage by expert regional labelling, based on inconsistencies that were identified by the experts. | Product description: Users can download the UMD LC Classification in two formats (.lan, .img), which are available in the section ""GIS-Compatible Formats"". The download is not easy and does only include the raster file with LUC information.  | Downloads:  | Practical considerations: There is no official website hosting this dataset, which makes it more difficult to access and understand. Users must bear in mind that this was one of the first global LUC datasets ever developed and it can therefore be considered outdated in technical terms.
Coarser versions of the 1 km map, resampled at 0.25, 0.5 and 1 degree of spatial resolution, are also available. 
Information about the codification and the meaning of all the other classification schemes can be found in the technical documentation included in the downloaded product, as well as in the documentation available on the project's website.  | Practical considerations: For more information about the product, users are referred to its readme file, | Project: GLC2000 was a project run by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission in collaboration with regional teams across the globe. The objective of the project was to create a homogeneous, coherent global LUC map that was suitable for environmental monitoring. The reference year 2000 was chosen because of its particular significance for that purpose. One of the most successful aspects of the project was the coordination of different teams across the globe to produce a global LUC map. To this end, GLC2000 provides a global dataset, together with a set of more detailed regional datasets adapted to the specificities of each territory. | Production method: GLC2000 was produced by different work teams across the globe. To this end, the world was split into 18 different regions, with each team mapping either a specific region or an area of special interest within a region.
A LUC map for each region was obtained through unsupervised classification of imagery captured by the VEGETATION sensor. The classifications obtained were then labelled by each regional team according to their local expertise in the area. Input for the classification varied in line with the particular characteristics of each region.
Regional LUC maps were merged into the global product, which is a coherent and homogeneous generalized mosaic of the set of regional maps. However, these regional maps provide more detail than the global one. | Product description: GLC2000 consists of two main products: the harmonized global LUC dataset covering the whole earth and the set of detailed regional LUC datasets. The Global LUC map can be downloaded in four different formats (ESRI, Binary, Tiff, Img), whereas the regional maps are only available in two (ESRI, Binary). The product for download includes a file to symbolize the raster LUC map as well as auxiliary information to interpret the legend. -Folder with raster file of the regional LUC map (glc_eu_v2) -Colormap file to symbolize the raster in ArcGIS (.clr) -DBF file with the map legend | Downloads:  | Legend and codification: Code Label  | Practical considerations: Information about map metadata is easily available on the project's website together with technical documents describing the products. This information can help users gain a better understanding of the maps and all their specific characteristics, advantages and disadvantages. GLC2000 has also been widely analysed in the scientific literature. Users can find out more about the particular characteristics and the accuracy of the database by consulting some of the references of interest cited above. | Project: This project aimed to merge available global LUC maps to create a new, more accurate dataset, in a bid to enable more accurate global LUC mapping. Reference LUC data collected by the Geo-Wiki platform via crowdsourcing was employed in the fusion process, so pioneering a practice that has become more common in recent years. The dataset obtained in this way was one of the first, best-known examples of data fusion for global LUC mapping. | Production method: The hybrid map of the Geo-Wiki project was produced by merging three global LUC datasets: GLC2000, GlobCover and MODIS LC. Whereas GLC2000 shows the LUC state of the world for the reference year 2000, the other two sources provide LUC information for the reference year 2005. The spatial resolution of the hybrid map is the same as applied in the dataset with the highest resolution: GlobCover (300 m). The other two datasets, which had a spatial resolution of 1 km, were resampled to fit this resolution.
For each dataset, a probability layer was produced indicating the probability of that source representing the correct LUC class on the ground. These layers were obtained by regressing the datasets with validation points created through Geo-Wiki campaigns. A Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) algorithm was employed to this end.
The probability layers were later merged in two different ways, delivering two LUC maps. For Hybrid Map 1, the LUC category from the dataset with the highest probability in the probability layers was selected. For Hybrid Map 2, when two LUC datasets agreed on a LUC category, this was selected. When the LUC datasets disagreed, the LUC category from the dataset with the highest probability in the probability layers was chosen. | Product description: Users can download the hybrid map in a compressed folder (.rar) which also contains the raster layers that store the LUC information. No other auxiliary information is provided. | Downloads:  | Geo-Wiki Hybrid (folder): -A raster file with LUC information (.img)  | Practical considerations: The Hybrid map is available online through the Geo-Wiki platform.  | Project: Land Degradation Assessment in Dryland (LADA) is a project led by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations that aims to assess and map land degradation at different scales and levels, so as to understand its impact on land use. As part of the datasets created in the project, a map of the world's Land Use Systems (LUS) was developed. Many other datasets were also created within the framework of this project, which may be of interest to users. | Production method: The dataset was obtained after the interpretation of LUC units over a spatial dataset generated by the overlay of different spatial thematic layers: the GLC2000 LUC map, cropland LUC maps, livestock distribution data, ecosystem and ecological indicators and socioeconomic factors such as population density. | Product description: The LADA LUC map can be downloaded in two different formats (ESRI GRID or TIF). In each case, users download the raster files containing the LUC information, together with a layer style file to symbolize the dataset in a GIS. | Downloads:  | ESRI GRID folder: -Folder with raster files including LUC information (""lus"") -Folder with product metadata (""info"") -Layer style file for ArcGIS (.lyr) TIF folder -Raster file with LUC map (.tiff) -Layer style file for ArcGIS (.lyr) | Legend and codification: Code Label Although the GLC-SHARE was produced in 2014, it was conceived as a living database that could integrate new LUC datasets as they were released or updated. Its production method has been made public, so enabling product replication.
As GLC-SHARE was produced by merging data from multiple databases, it has no specific date of reference. There are different dates for each part of the world, according to the main product that was used to map them. | Production method: GLC-SHARE was produced by merging and integrating high-quality LUC data for different areas of the world. LUC data at all scales (global, national, sub-national, regional) was used to produce the map.
In order to merge the various LUC datasets into a single product, their legends had to be harmonized. When different products were available for the same area, the one with the most detailed, most accurate data was chosen. If no products were available at detailed or national scales, global LUC datasets (Globcover 2009, MODIS VCF 2010 and Cropland database 2012) were used instead. The main areas not covered by high-resolution datasets included Latin America, West Africa, Indonesia and important parts of Asia, such as Thailand and the Arabian Peninsula.
An initial map for each of the 11 land cover classes that make up the classification legend of the GLC-SHARE was obtained. Each map shows the proportion that each land cover occupies in each pixel of the GLC-SHARE grid. Finally, from the 11 thematic rasters created, a general raster was obtained indicating the dominant land cover type in each pixel. | Product description: GLC-SHARE products can be downloaded in raster format or as a kml file to upload in Google Earth or any other GIS software. GLC-SHARE maps are also available through a WMS web service.
Users can download the global GLC-SHARE LUC map, which indicates the dominant land cover type in each pixel, or individual LUC rasters showing the proportions of each LUC type in each pixel. In these rasters, the pixel value refers to the proportion (0-100) at which each category is represented in the pixel. A pixel covered exclusively by artificial surfaces would have a value of 100 in the ""GLC-Share -Artificial surfaces"" raster.
Users can also download auxiliary information about the dataset from the website. This includes a technical report about the product (GLC-Share report) as well as a raster and an excel spreadsheet explaining which dataset was used to map each area of the world (GLC-Share-Sources).  | Practical considerations: GLC-SHARE is a single product with no information about changes in LUC over time. It was created in 2014, which may therefore be considered the reference year for the dataset. However, this date may vary a great deal between the different parts of the world. GLC-SHARE is therefore not recommended for studies or analyses of LUC change.
Although the dataset was conceived as a live map, it has not been further updated with the inclusion of new LULC datasets since 2014. | Project: OSM Landuse/Landcover (LULC) is a LUC dataset created as part of the H2020 project ""LandSense"", which aims to engage citizens in the production of LUC information. The OSM LULC has been developed above all by the GIScience research group from Heidelberg University.
OSM LULC is an attempt to exploit the LUC information contained in the OpenStreetMaps (OSM) database. It is a test project and therefore cannot be regarded as a final product with full global coverage. Nevertheless, the project has developed a workflow to obtain LUC information from the OSM database as well as a methodology for obtaining an LUC map with full coverage over a specific test area (Heidelberg), filling the gaps in the OSM via classification of satellite imagery. | Production method: OSM LULC was produced using a very simple method. Authors downloaded the OSM database and translated the tags that define the features stored in the database into LUC terms (the legend for the Corine Land Cover (CLC) survey was used as a reference). An equivalence table between the OSM tags and the CLC level 2 legend was created.
The OSM LUC information, in vector, was generalized in a 30 m pixel side grid. In the event of feature overlap when aggregating information, preference was given to the smaller features.
Gap areas not covered by the OSM database were filled with the LUC information obtained by a supervised classification of Landsat imagery with the random forest classifier. This process was only carried out for a European test area, leaving important information gaps in the rest of the global map.
Due to the particular characteristics of the OSM database, LUC information is not provided for a single date. Each feature of the database has a different date. This makes it difficult to determine the date of reference for each pixel in the dataset. | Product description: The product was initially distributed in tiles. However, users can also request a specific file for their area of interest by email. These files contain the LUC map and an Excel spreadsheet with the pixel count for each category. They do not include the qualitative meaning of the category codes.  | Downloads:  | Practical considerations: The website for this database includes a form for those who want to download the map. However, interested users are recommended to contact the map producers directly, as the first approach does not always work. Contact details for the map producers are available at the project's website.  | Global General Land Use Cover Datasets with a Time Series of Maps: David Garc√≠a-√Ålvarez, Javier Lara Hinojosa, Francisco Jos√© Jurado P√©rez, and Jaime Quintero Villaraso Abstract General Land Use Cover (LUC) datasets provide a holistic picture of all the land uses and covers on Earth, without focusing specifically on any individual land use category. As opposed to the LUC maps which are only available for one date or year, reviewed in Chap. ""Global General Land Use Cover Datasets with a Single Date"", the maps with time series allow users to study LUC change over time. Time series of general LUC datasets at a global scale is useful for understanding global patterns of LUC change and their relation with global processes such as climate change or the loss of biodiversity. MCD12Q1, also known as MODIS Land Cover, was the first time series of LUC maps to be produced on a global scale. When it was first launched in 2002, there were already many organizations and researchers working on accurate, detailed global LUC maps, although these were all one-off editions for single years. The MCD12Q1 dataset continues to be updated today, providing a series of maps for the period 2001-2018. Since the launch of MCD12Q1, many other historical series of LUC maps have been produced, especially in the last decade. This has resulted in the LUC map series covering a longer time period at higher spatial resolution. Recent efforts have focused on producing consistent time series of maps that can track LUC changes over time with low levels of uncertainty. GLCNMO (500 m), GlobCover (300 m) and GLC250 (250 m) provide time series of LUC maps at similar spatial resolutions to MCD12Q1 (500 m), although for fewer reference years. GLCNMO provides information for the years 
The project was launched in 2009 and has been developed in different phases. The initial idea was to create a LUC product covering three time periods 
Apart from LUC maps, other interesting products have also been created as part of the Climate Change Initiative: weekly image composites of the AVHRR (1992-1999, 1 km),  | Production method: The LC-CCI LUC map series is based on a single base LUC map that is progressively updated and backdated. The base LUC layer was created by classifying a series of composite MERIS imagery for the period 2003-2012. A different classification was carried out for each year of this period, and the map finally obtained was a combination of all these classifications. This allowed them to differentiate between land cover states (i.e. those land features that remain stable over time) and land cover seasonality (i.e. natural, seasonal variability of land cover features that do not imply a change in the cover itself).
The classification method combined the GlobCover unsupervised classification chain with a machine learning algorithm. During the classification process, a series of spectrotemporal classes were identified. These were later labelled to LUC classes with the help of experts. The classification was regionalized to account for regional diversity and local heterogeneity of land cover characteristics.
Change detection for updating and backdating the base map was carried out with imagery from different sensors (AVHRR, SPOT, MERIS and PROVA), according to image availability. Changes were detected at a spatial resolution of 1 km, and since 2013 have been delineated at 300 m. Previously, delineation of changes at finer spatial resolutions had been impossible due to the lack of available images.
As a general rule, the only changes studied were those between six wide categories, which are not semantically close to each other: agriculture, forest, grassland, wetland, settlement and others. These changes had to persist for at least two years to be considered. The purpose of these rules was to try to ensure the stability over time of the LUC map series, avoiding technical changes and noise. | Product description: The LC-CCI dataset is distributed in different ways. This gives users the flexibility to download the product that best suits their needs. A single LUC map in either GeoTIFF or NetCDF4 may be downloaded for each year of the period 1992-2015. For the most recent years (2016-2018), these are only available in NetCDF4 format. Additionally, the whole time series of maps for the period 1992-2015 can be downloaded as a single raster with multiple bands, in either of the two formats available.
When downloading the LUC maps, users only gain access to the rasters with LUC information. However, other supplementary information is available on the project's website. This includes a CSV file with the legend description; layer style files for displaying the rasters in common GIS software (ArcGIS, ENVI and QGIS); GeoTIFF files with information about the quality and uncertainty of the LUC maps time series (Quality flags); and a data package for users working with the Sen2Cor classification software.  | Downloads:  | Practical considerations: The project is aimed at the climate change research community and therefore provides the LUC data in the NetCDF4 raster file format commonly used by this community. However, .nc files are much heavier than .tiff files.
LUC maps for single years are easily displayed in QGIS. However, raster files storing the whole series of LUC maps for the period 1992-2015 are very heavy and are difficult to display in QGIS without a computer with good processing power. | Project: GlobeLand30 (GLC30) is a project funded and promoted by the Chinese government and the National Science Foundation of China. It aims to coherently map the land uses and covers on the world's surface at a detailed scale, using images from the Landsat satellite imagery archive.
The project initially focused on analysing the best methods and procedures to carry out such an ambitious task. It then produced a global LUC map at 30 m for the reference years 2000 and 2010. An update of the dataset for the year 2020 was recently released, in which Antarctica was mapped for the first time. | Production method: GLC30 was obtained after classifying Landsat imagery using a pixel-object-knowledge-based (POK-based) classification approach. Other sources of complementary imagery were also used for the reference years 2010 (HJ-1-China Environment and Disaster Reduction Satellite) and 2020 (GF-1-China High Resolution Satellite).
The classification was carried out independently for each of the mapped categories. Water bodies were mapped first, followed by wetlands, snow and ice, artificial surfaces, cultivated land, forest, scrubland, grassland, barren land and finally tundra. Once a LUC category had been classified, the pixels assigned to that category were masked for the following classifications.
Each category was classified according to a specific approach, adapted to the characteristics of the features being mapped. For most of the categories, the classification approach consisted of three main steps: a pixel-based classifier, image segmentation and knowledge-based verification. For this last step, different sources of auxiliary information were used via their integration in a web-based data platform. | Product description: GLC30 is distributed in tiles. Users can separately download a LUC map for each tile and year of reference. The download includes the LUC map in raster format, a metadata file and a vector file with information about the satellite imagery used to obtain the map.  | Downloads:  | Practical considerations: The GLC30 LUC maps for 2000, 2010 and 2020 can also be accessed online through the project website, 
There are no technical documents describing the latest update of the map for the year 2020. Methodological changes in the production of the map could have been implemented which could lead to errors when comparing with previous editions.
The project website is not always maintained. It has been unattended for many months over recent years. If the website is not maintained, it is possible that the dataset may be not accessible in the future. | Project: This product forms part of the project led by Tsinghua University to effectively map land uses and covers across the world, which mainly focused on FROM-GLC and the production of thematic LUC databases. Several of these datasets were used in the production of GLC250. The classification legend for GLC250 was also taken from FROM-GLC. | Production method: GLC250 was obtained after the classification of MODIS imagery (MOD13Q1) with a random forest classifier fed with auxiliary data: slope, latitude, MODIS vegetation indexes. For each year of reference 
The three probability maps obtained after the classification carried out for each year of reference were processed through a spatial-temporal consistency model (MAP-MRF) to improve the LUC classification. The final LUC map was improved in a post-classification phase through a rule-based label adjustment method using auxiliary data from MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields (MOD44B), slope and Enhanced Vegetation Index series. | Product description: A map for each year of reference can be downloaded in a single compressed file. Each file contains all the raster files that make up the LUC map for each year of reference. To this end, the global map is split into multiple tiles following the MODIS tile grid.  | Legend and codification: The GLC250 classification scheme is the same as that developed for FROM-GLC. A complementary product at coarser resolution has been developed as part of the same project: MCD12C1 (0.05 Deg). | Production method: MCD12Q1 was obtained by means of supervised classification (Random Forests) of MODIS imagery for the period 2001-2020. Once the classification had been obtained for each year, it was adjusted with the aid of auxiliary data: C5 MCD12Q1, C6 MODIS Land Water mask, C5 MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF), WorldClim dataset, a global urban layer and global crop type information compiled from census data.
As a result of the classification, class probability rasters were obtained for each LUC category. These inform about the probability of each pixel belonging to a specific LUC category. These probability layers provided a base on which to map LUC covers according to six different classification schemes: IGBP, UMD, LAI, BGC, PFT and FAO-LCCS. In order to ensure the consistency of the classification over time, a hidden Markov model (HMM) was applied to the adjusted classification to reduce spurious changes over time. | Product description: MCD12Q1 may be downloaded through different servers or tools: AppEEARS, Data Pool, NASA Earthdata Search, USGS EarthExplorer, OPeNDAP, DAAC2Disk Utility and LDOPE. Depending on the server or tool chosen, users can download the product as a single file for each year of reference or in tiles for specific areas of interest.
The download includes the raster file with LUC data in six different classification schemes and PDF documents with the technical specifications for the product.  | Downloads:  | Practical considerations: As there are no auxiliary datasets or documentation, users who require more detailed information about the characteristics of the dataset should consult the scientific papers cited above (14.6 Technical Documentation).  | Overall accuracy: Expected to be >78.0%  | Production method: GlobCover maps were obtained by classifying imagery captured by the MERIS sensor. Urban and wetland areas, which are not well represented, were classified using a supervised classifier. The remaining categories were classified in a series of spectro-temporal classes through an unsupervised classifier. Once classified, the spectro-temporal classes were labelled automatically according to the information provided by the reference datasets. For the 2005 map, the reference datasets were the GLC2000 global LUC map (see Sect. 3 in Chap. ""Global General Land Use Cover Datasets with a Single Date"" Global General Land Use Cover Datasets with a Single Date) and other high-quality regional LUC maps. For the 2009 map, the GlobCover 2005 map was used as a reference.
The area for classification was divided into different regions, to account for the ecological and reflectance diversity of the world. Once labelled after classification, the LUC map was finally edited to account for inaccuracies in the representation of certain features.
For the 2005 version, regional maps with a more detailed legend were also produced following the same classification procedure. | Product description: A zipped file is available for each GlobCover map. It contains the raster layer with the LUC information and all the auxiliary data that users may need to correctly interpret the dataset. This includes the classification legend, technical and data quality information, and files with the layer style of the map to automatically symbolize the raster in GIS software. A complementary raster detailing the source of the LUC information for each pixel (MERIS sensor classification (value = null) or a land cover database (value = 1)) is also provided. In a separate file, users can also download a raster for a coloured version of the LUC map.  | Downloads:  | Legend and codification: A specific two-level classification scheme legend was initially developed for the FROM-GLC project in 2010. This was updated with various changes for the FROM-GLC map for 2015. The map for 2017 has the simplest, least detailed classification legend (Level 1). In each case, we include the most detailed classification scheme available for each year. Users can consult the correspondence between level 2 and level 1 of the classification scheme for the years 2010 and 2015 at the project website.  | Practical considerations: The project website, where all the information is stored and available for download, is not user-friendly. It is not easy to find the information the user is looking for. Users may also struggle to download datasets for their area of interest according to latitude and longitude information. When available, we recommend using the kmz file with Google Earth for this purpose.
There is little additional information. For a complete description of the characteristics of the different maps, we recommend users to read the scientific papers cited in the introduction to this dataset above (14.8. Technical Documentation).
7 http://data.ess.tsinghua.edu.cn/. | 306: D. Garc√≠a-√Ålvarez et al. | Project: CGLS-LC100 is one of the deliverables produced as part of the Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS), which aims to provide a series of bio-geophysical products to monitor land surface at a global scale. In addition to this LUC package, the programme produces other relevant variables, such as the Leaf Area Index (LAI), the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR), the Land Surface Temperature, soil moisture and other vegetation indices.
The first version of CGLS-LC100 was released in 2017, mapping LUC for Africa. Since then, several updates of the product have improved the production methodology and extended its temporal and geographical coverage. The last version of the product (Collection 3), released in 2021, covers the whole world for the period 2015-2019. It includes a method for detecting land cover change that addresses the main sources of technical uncertainty when studying change in a time series of LUC maps.
In addition to the LUC map described here, the product also includes a series of continuous field layers or ""fraction maps"" for the basic LUC classes mapped. Future updates of the product are expected on an annual basis, using the imagery provided by the Sentinel satellite missions. | Production method: The Copernicus Global Land Service Dynamic Land Cover map is produced through a multistep processing framework. First, PROBA-V satellite images are pre-processed and merged following a Sentinel-2 tiling grid to create a 3-year epoch mosaic for each reference year. Second, a series of metrics (spectral and textural metrics, descriptive statistics) are extracted from each epoch mosaic. Third, imagery for all the epochs is classified using a regression algorithm, which delivers a cover fraction layer for each basic LUC class and reference year, and a supervised classification algorithm, which delivers a LUC map for each reference year.
Various auxiliary data sources are used in the classification phase, i.e. seven different data masks and three extra datasets: biome clusters, water cover fractions and built-up cover fractions.
In order to ensure the temporal consistency of the LUC map series, it was decided to include a temporal postprocessing phase in the production of the dataset. This consists of a BFAST break detection algorithm and a Hidden Markov Model. The former is used to detect changes in an independent time series of MODIS NIRv imagery, while the latter is used to rule out technical changes in the classified epoch images. | Product description: CGLS-LC100 is distributed in tiles, following the Sentinel-2 tiling grid (110 √Ç 110 km). For each tile, users can download many different layers: the discrete classification containing the LUC map for the selected area; a layer with the classification probability; layers of cover fractions for each of the basic LUC classes mapped; a layer showing the level of confidence for the change measured between the different years in each pixel; and two extra layers: forest types and input data density.
The download of the LUC map only includes the raster file with the LUC information. Each reference year must be downloaded separately.   | Downloads:  | Practical considerations: Because of the large number of datasets available through this project, users are encouraged to make use of the different layers of LUC information available. This will give them a better understanding of the uncertainties and limitations of the product. Users can download the product covering the whole globe, which is distributed through the files in the Zenodo repository. 8  Open Access This chapter is licensed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http:// creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license and indicate if changes were made.

First, gross and net LUC changes per decade were obtained for the period 1950-2010 from a set of sources providing historic LUC information: UNFCCC national reporting data, CORINE Land Cover, Historisch Grondgebruik Nederland (HGN) for the Netherlands, FAO-RSS data and BioPress data with classified aerial photographs of 73 sample sites across Europe. Later, LUC data was spatially allocated by the HILDA model. Four categories were spatially allocated at this stage. A fifth category (other land) remained static throughout the time series. Water was a subclass of the ""other land"" category, which was only separated in the final maps for visualization purposes.
The model allocates the LUC categories using a series of probability maps. A specific probability map for each category was created on the basis of historical LUC maps and a range of socioeconomic and physical (soil properties, climate and terrain) factors. The categories were allocated hierarchically according to their socioeconomic value: settlements were allocated first, followed by croplands, forest and grasslands.
Once the model had been run for the 1950-2010 timeframe, four extra maps were obtained for the period 1900-1950 based on historical LUC statistics and an extrapolation of the change matrix. The pre-1950 maps therefore assume stable transition rates for the period 1950-2010. This could be an important source of uncertainty in these maps. | Product description: The product is delivered in four different packages, two of which include the series of LUC maps . Of these, one considers the net changes over the course of each decade, while the other considers the gross changes. The other two packages detail the specific transitions that take place between the different categories, one charting net changes and the other gross changes.
Each package can be downloaded in three different file formats (ESRI Grid, TIFF, ASCII). Each download includes a raster with LUC information for each decade and a supplementary file with the technical description of the product. The number of countries taking part in the project has been increasing since its inception, from the initial group of 26 countries that created the CLC 1990 to the 39 countries that participated in the most recent edition 2 . In the meantime, the production of CLC has undergone several technical and methodological changes. The fact that CLC is produced at a national level means that methods vary from one country to the next. | Downloads: Because of its long life, detail, consistency and wide range of applications, CLC is one of the most renowned LUC mapping initiatives worldwide. Various European countries have developed national LUC products based on CLC. In some cases, these products are new CLC layers with an extended legend, adapted to the specificities of the country. In other cases, they are new CLC layers for different dates to those used in the main Europe-wide project. | Production method: The production of CLC is coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA). Each participant country is responsible for mapping its own territory according to the general guidelines developed by the EEA.
The method of production may vary from country to country. Initially, CLC was mapped at national scales based on the photointerpretation of Landsat imagery. In the following editions, most of the countries decided to stick to this method, using different satellite imagery according to EEA prescriptions: Landsat, SPOT; ITS P6, RapidEye, LISS III, Sentinel. In the latest editions, the production method has varied in some cases. A few countries, like Germany or Spain, produce the CLC database by generalizing national LUC databases at finer scales. This has introduced important changes in the way land uses and covers are mapped over time for these countries. For both production methods, photointerpretation and map generalization, the CLC map obtained is then subject to expert review to ensure its consistency and validity.
The first CLC map was produced for the reference year 1990 and the subsequent editions have been updates of this initial map. The national teams do not draw a new map for each new reference year. Instead, they map the changes for the analysed period 
In addition to the maps for each reference year, CLC produces change layers for each period between reference years  | Product description: CLC is made up of two spatial layers: a Land Use Cover map for each reference year 
CLC layers are provided in either vector (ESRI or GeoPackage databases) or raster (.tiff) formats. As might be expected, the vector data is much heavier than the raster data, because of its higher definition.
Together with the LUC layers, the CLC product includes all the auxiliary information required to understand the LUC information provided by the CLC layers: a style layer for the raster, the legend description, technical information and other relevant metadata. LUC maps for the French overseas departments (Guadeloupe, French Guinea, Martinique, Mayotte and Reunion) are also provided in auxiliary layers. | Downloads: The base layers with LUC maps for each reference year (CLC) have the same structure and group of files, as do the change layers for each period of analysis (CHA). This is why we only describe the file structure once for each type of format.

-C18: LUC code for the year 2018. | Database: General Land Use Cover Datasets for Europe   | Practical considerations: CLC was originally mapped in vector format. This format provides higher precision and detail and is therefore recommended when working at local and regional scales. At national and supranational scales, raster data can be more suitable, as vector data is too heavy and may be difficult to handle in desktop computers with insufficient processing power. Users can download the vector CLC to rasterize the database to the spatial resolution they require. The 100 m offered is the reference resolution provided by the EEA, but it is not the only one at which the map could be used.
Users should be aware that different mapping methodologies were used in different countries, and in some countries, at different times. This could result in significant differences in the way the landscape is mapped and conceptualised, which could introduce important sources of uncertainty in our studies and analyses. The same category could be interpreted differently in different countries, and even within the same country, a particular category could be mapped differently at different times if the production method changes. Those wishing to analyse LUC change should therefore use the change layers rather than the maps.
Project PELCOM (Pan-European Land Cover Monitoring) was a research project funded by the European Union that ran from 1996 to 1999. The main purpose of the project was to develop a consistent methodology to create a continental LUC map for Europe from remote sensing sources. Users were consulted about their needs and requirements and revealed that they would like to have LUC data at coarser and finer spatial resolutions than CLC, and that CLC could be updated more frequently. They also made clear that a dataset of this kind would be useful for environmental modelling and monitoring purposes.
At the time the project was launched, no consistent continental LUC maps were available at high spatial resolution (at least 1 km). The map created through the project sought to provide a high-resolution continental LUC dataset that could later be updated frequently. However, despite these original intentions, the PELCOM map has not been updated since the project came to an end. | Production method: The classification carried out for the PELCOM map was based on AVHRR imagery and NDVI composites from the DLR archive of the JRC. An improved stratified, integrated classification methodology was specifically developed by the creators of this map. To this end, Europe was divided into different strata according to similarities in LULC patterns and phenology.
The classification process consisted of several steps, in which users played an important role. Both supervised and unsupervised classifiers were employed. Some classes (forest, water bodies, urban areas) were mapped through specific workflows, using masks and other strategies, to improve the uncertainty and errors associated with their classification. | Product description: PELCOM may be downloaded in three different formats: ESRI-grid, ERDAS-Image and ENVI. The download includes the raster with the LUC map and, depending on the format chosen, auxiliary information about the product (readme and symbology files).
Detailed technical documentation about the map and its production method is also available from the download site.  | Downloads:  | Practical considerations: The product is no longer available for download from the official website of the EEA. The only edition that can still be obtained is the map for 2005, which is available through the geoportal of the Universit√© Catholique de Louvain, one of the producers of the dataset. The map can also be consulted online at the same website, without having to download it. While the GlobCorine classification legend focuses particularly on land use, GlobCover centres on land cover. GlobCorine can therefore be regarded as a complementary dataset to GlobCover. | Project: N2K was developed as part of the Copernicus Land Monitoring programme. It maps land uses and covers in the areas that form part of the Natura 2000 network, plus a 2 km buffer zone around their perimeters. Natura 2000 is a network that protects natural areas with rare and threatened species or with rare types of natural habitat.
The dataset first appeared in 2015. A reviewed edition was issued in 2017 with a new classification legend that made it compatible with other European local reference LUC datasets: Riparian Zones, N2K and the Coastal Zone product. | Production method: N2K is obtained by photointerpretation of high-resolution imagery. Various auxiliary datasets are used in the photointerpretation process, namely CORINE Land Cover, Urban Atlas, High Resolution Layers, topographic maps, national WMS services and COTS navigation data. The changes are also photointerpreted by comparing satellite images at two different points in time. | Product description: N2K is distributed as a single vector file covering all mapped Nature 2000 areas. Two formats are available: ESRI Geodatabase and Geopackage. Downloads include the layers with LUC information, a style file to symbolize the layers in GIS and a pdf with the product classification scheme.  | Downloads:  | Database: N2K was produced according to a hierarchical classification legend made up of four different levels, the most detailed of which is provided here (MAES L3). Information about the other levels of classification and their codes can be found in the technical documents accompanying the dataset.  | Practical considerations: N2K files are very heavy (over 2gb), which means that they may be difficult to use for those without powerful computers.
The map can also be consulted online in a viewer included in the download website of the product. Together with the LUC map of riparian zones, two extra complementary products are also provided: a delineation of Riparian Zones based on a fuzzy modelling approach and an inventory of the Green Linear Elements (hedgerows and lines of trees) growing in those riparian areas. | Production method: The RZ map was obtained through semi-automatic classification of very high-resolution imagery captured by the SPOT and Pleiades satellites  | Product description: A different vector file is provided for each riparian area mapped. Downloads include the vector file with LUC information and pdf documents with information about the product.   | Downloads:  | Practical considerations: The map can also be consulted online in a viewer available on the download site (see link above). | Project: The Coastal Zones Land Cover/Land Use dataset is produced by the European Environment Agency (EEA) as part of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS). The dataset has been developed in collaboration with the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) and representatives from the potential community of users.
It is specifically intended for monitoring coastal areas and provides an important source of information for all EU policies dealing with coastal management and maritime spatial planning.
The dataset maps, at very detailed scale, the land uses and covers in coastal areas in the 39 countries belonging to the EEA. The coastal area mapped is defined by a 10 km inland buffer zone and the Corine Land Cover (CLC) seawards buffer zone. Relevant estuaries, coastal lowlands and nature reserves that extend beyond the buffer zone have also been included.
The dataset's classification legend has been specifically designed to fit the needs of its user community. It is based on the Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES) ecosystem typology and makes the product compatible with other CLMS local monitoring datasets, such as Urban Atlas, Riparian Zones and N2K.
The dataset is composed of two LUC maps for the reference years 2012 and 2018, plus a change layer for the period 2012-2018. The dataset will be updated every 6 years, in accordance with the CLC production timeline. | Production method: The Coastal Zones Land Cover/Land Use dataset is produced via computer-assisted photointerpretation of very high spatial resolution  | Product description: Users can download the Coastal Zones dataset in two different formats: Geodatabase and GeoPackage. Different download files are available for each year of reference  | Project: Sentinel-2 Global Land Cover (S2GLC) was a project funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) in order to create an automatic methodology to globally map LUC at high resolution from Sentinel-2 imagery. The project was led by the Space Research Centre of the Polish Academy of Sciences (CBK PAN). Its main output is the S2GLC 2017 map.
The project was developed in two phases. In the first phase, the proposed methodology was tested in five prototype sites: Germany, Italy, China, Columbia and Namibia. In the second phase, the methodology was adjusted to map LUC for the whole of Europe, except Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.
Production method S2GLC was obtained by classifying Sentinel-2 imagery. Each Sentinel-2 scene was individually classified using a set of multi-temporal images through a random forest classifier. Training data was automatically extracted from existing datasets, such as CORINE Land Cover. A set of probability rasters were obtained from the random forest classifier, and the class finally selected for each pixel was the one with the highest probability over the whole time series. A post-classification step was applied for those pixels with low probabilities. | Product description: S2GLC 2017 can be downloaded as a single file or in tiles. In the first case, users can choose to download the raster LUC file, either symbolized (RGB GeoTiff file) or not (GeoTiff file). Users who opt to download a tile from the map will automatically download both types of rasters.

It was coordinated by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in South Africa, with the participation of organizations from the different countries being mapped. The objective of the project was to deliver a coherent Land Use Cover map covering the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region. The project builds on earlier LUC mapping work carried out at national and regional scales for each of the mapped countries.
The map covers those SADC countries that already had a LUC dataset available for their territory: Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zimbabwe. The other countries in the region are not included in the map. | Production method: The SADC Land Cover Database was obtained by harmonizing and fusing the different national and regional LUC datasets. All the datasets were originally obtained by classification or photointerpretation of Landsat imagery, although the reference years vary from country to country.
The maps were combined by resampling to a spatial resolution of 1 km, before being reclassified according to the same classification system. This reduced the detail of the original maps, a deliberate action to avoid copyright and commercialisation issues. | Product description: The dataset is downloaded as a single compressed file (.zip), which includes the vector LUC map, a metadata file and a complete map (i.e. with colours, graphics, scale and legend) in jpg format that is ready to print out.  | Downloads:  | SADC:  | Legend and codification:  | Practical considerations: A detailed description of the map categories is available in the dataset's metadata. The map's production method entails certain limitations and uncertainties, in that each country has been mapped by a different team, using different sources of imagery for different reference years. Inconsistencies may therefore arise when comparing information between countries.
Project AFRICOVER was a project led and coordinated by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, which aimed to create georeferenced data for the African continent. The FAO helped the different countries and regions to develop their reference maps, establishing the standards for the final product. Twelve countries participated in the project (Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Eritrea, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Libya and Malawi), which therefore required extensive coordination of many national and regional teams across Africa.
A keystone of the project was the production of LUC maps for Africa. In addition to LUC maps, other georeferenced data were created for a range of themes: hydrology, geomorphology, demography‚Ä¶ | Production method: The production of AFRICOVER was decentralised at a national and regional level. Although the FAO defined the guidelines and standards for the product, national and regional teams from each country were responsible for its execution. This meant that although a set of common characteristics regarding the production of AFRICOVER had been established for all the countries involved, certain specificities could also arise.
AFRICOVER LUC maps were mainly obtained through photointerpretation of satellite imagery, of which Landsat was the main source. The photointerpretation scale was 1:200,000. When drawing LUC polygons, the FAO LCSS classification scheme was followed. The FAO provided national and regional teams with specific software and training to carry out LUC mapping according to this approach. | Product description: AFRICOVER LUC maps are distributed at a national level. A compressed file can be downloaded for each country. This includes the vector LUC map and a legend description to help users interpret it. Practical considerations AFRICOVER LUC maps have been created following the FAO LCSS classification scheme. This means that each LUC polygon is described through a specific code that identifies the general cover of the polygon and characterizes it through a series of labels. Users may find this system difficult to understand, as it does not follow a common hierarchical classification legend in which each polygon is defined by a single category.  | Downloads:  | Practical considerations: The map is distributed as a single, very heavy file (6 Gb). Users with limited computer and internet capacities may find it difficult to download and work with this product. Nonetheless, a preview tool is available online for any user wishing to consult the map.  | Practical considerations: Users can consult the LUC map online on the Universit√© Catholique de Louvain website (http://maps.elie.ucl.ac.be/ geoportail/). | Project: The Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in the Amazon (LBA) was an international project launched by the Brazilian scientific community in 1993. The main objectives were to study Amazonia and its role in the earth's ecosystem as well as to understand LUC changes in the area and their environmental consequences.
As part of the project, a global LUC map covering South America was produced from imagery and data of the period 1987/91. Vegetation and soil maps for Brazil were also digitalized on the basis of previous resources. These maps are also available for any interested user as part of the same dataset. | Production method: The LBA LUC map was produced after unsupervised classification of AVHRR imagery, postprocessing and labelling of the classification results. Different sources of auxiliary data were used in the production of the dataset to overcome the limitations of the imagery, including a Global Vegetation Index (GVI) layer, the UNESCO's Vegetation Map of South America, the Hueck's Vegetationsskarte Von Sudamerika and a potential vegetation map of South America based on the Holdridge bioclimatic scheme. | Production description: Users can download the LUC map as a single raster file including the LUC information or as part of a data package including all the products produced within the LBA project. As part of these, we find different vegetation and soil maps for Brazil. In all cases, the download only includes the raster files and no auxiliary information is provided. The change layers include a qualitative description of the classes at the two different points in time. In addition, the pixel values are formed by combining the class code for the land use at point 1 in time with the class code for the new land use at point 2. e.g. the code 1011 refers to a pixel that was Temperate or sub-polar grassland (10) on the first date assessed and had changed to Sub-polar or polar shrubland-lichen-moss (11) on the second.  | Downloads:  | Practical considerations: Maps at 30 m and 250 m were obtained following a different workflow and are not comparable. The maps for Mexico for 2010 and 2015 were obtained from different imagery sources, which means that changes cannot be calculated by subtracting one map from the other and should only be studied using the change layer distributed by the production team.
No information is offered about the uncertainty of the change layers. They may be subject to important sources of uncertainty and may include a lot of technical or spurious changes that did not actually happen on the ground.
NALCMS is one of the products in the North American Environmental Atlas. Users can consult the different NALCMS layers online, together with a lot of other relevant geospatial information for North America, as part of the Atlas website at http://www.cec.org/files/atlas/. Users can also download any of the displayed layers, including the LUC maps, from the same website.  | Practical considerations: This dataset is not directly available for download. Users wishing to access it must contact the JRC team that produced it (Hugh.EVA@ec.europa.eu, Rene.BEUCHLE@ec.europa. eu).
Although the dataset has been used to assess LUC changes by comparing it with GLC2000, this exercise has many limitations and uncertainties and is therefore not recommended. | 368: D. Garc√≠a-√Ålvarez and J. Lara Hinojosa | Project: The Himalaya Regional Land Cover database was developed within the context of the Global Land Cover Network-Regional Harmonization Programme, promoted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and UN Environment in collaboration with the Geographic Information for Sustainable Development (GISD) global partnership. The programme aimed to produce reliable, harmonized global land cover information, providing guidance and methodologies for the production of LUC information at national, regional and global levels. | Production method: The database was obtained by automatic segmentation of Landsat imagery for the reference year 2000 plus visual interpretation. The initial classification was refined by interpreting high resolution imagery from Google Earth. A layer of LUC changes was obtained by assessing the base map (2000) against historical imagery for the periods  | Product description: The database is distributed at regional level in vector format for each of the countries and regions that make up the Himalayan region: Afghanistan, Bhutan, China-Yunnan Sheng, China-Xizang Zizhiqu, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Aksai Chin, Arunachal Pradesh, China/India, Jammu Kashmir and Myanmar. An additional vector layer with LUC changes for the period 1970-2007 is also included. The downloaded products consist solely of the vector layers with LUC data. No other auxiliary information is provided with the downloaded file.
A detailed legend for the product can be downloaded separately in Excel or mdb formats. A layer with the boundaries of the region and its administrative units is also available for download.

FRA is a project run by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) that dates back to the year 1946. A new edition is issued every five years on average.
The project, which is carried out in collaboration with the different countries that form part of the FAO, aims to assess the state of the world's forests and understand the changes that they undergo over time. Satellite imagery and remote sensing techniques were used for the first time in the FRA2000 survey. A global map of forests was produced as part of the project. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) EROS Data Center (EDC) was in charge of map production. Two extra maps were also produced as part of the project: an ecological zoning map and a map of protected forests. | Production method: The World's Forests 2000 map was produced in two stages. In the first stage, closed forest and open or fragmented forest categories were mapped on the basis of a classification of AVHRR imagery for the period 1995-1996. A complex methodology based on a mixture analysis model and a geographical stratification to account for regional variation in the mapped features was employed to calculate the fraction cover per pixel. The two LUC categories were extracted from these layers based on the tree cover percentages defined by the FAO: 40-100% for closed forest and 10-40% for open or fragmented forest.
In the second stage, the Global Land Cover Characteristics Database (GLCC), obtained from a classification of AVHRR imagery for the period 1992/93, was used to map the remaining categories: other wooded land, other land cover and water. The fact that the different input data (AVHRR and GLCC) had different reference dates led to temporal inconsistency between forest and non-forest categories.
Some auxiliary datasets were also used in the production of the map, such as ecoregion maps and digital elevation models. These helped to merge and split the different categories being mapped. | Product description: The map can be downloaded as a zipped file containing the raster with the LUC information and other auxiliary information. The download includes two versions of the LUC map, one classifying the land covers in a range of values from 1 to 6 and the other classifying the land covers in a range of values from 100 to 600.  | Downloads:  | Practical considerations: SYNMAP was designed to satisfy the needs of a very specific community: carbon cycle and vegetation modellers. The dataset can be consulted online via a web application.  | Practical considerations: The dataset can be easily visualized and consulted through a web-based visualization tool.  | Practical considerations: Users must bear in mind that although the dataset is distributed as a single raster file, this includes multiple layers with different, complementary information. Nonetheless, the core of the product is the band storing information about the percentage of tree cover. The dataset can be also consulted online through a Web Map Service (WMS). | Project: The Percent Tree Cover Global version is a dataset created within the context of the Global Mapping Project, which aimed to create a global reference database of geospatial information. The project was promoted by the International Steering Committee for Global Mapping (ISCGM) in cooperation with National Geospatial Information Authorities (NGIAs) from different countries and regions across the world. It came to an end in 2016, when the ISCGM decided to wind up the project and transfer all the data to the Geospatial Information Section of the United Nations.
The PTC map was generated by a group of researchers from the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (GSI) and Chiba University. Two versions of the map were produced: one for the reference year 2003 and another for the reference year 2008. | Production method: The map was obtained via the classification of MODIS imagery. No other information is available about how the PTC Global version was produced. | Product description: A single download containing the map for the entire globe is available for the year 2003. For the year 2008, the map is distributed in 12 different tiles. Each tile covers an area of 90 degrees of latitude and 60 degrees of longitude. The downloads only include the raster files with LUC information. There are no auxiliary data.  | Downloads:  | Practical considerations: This dataset lacks auxiliary and technical information about specific characteristics and possible limitations, including data about its accuracy. It must therefore be used with caution.
General information about the Global Mapping Project can be found at https://www.gsi.go.jp/kankyochiri/gm_ report_e.html. More information about the project within which the dataset was created can be found at this website. | 390: D. Garc√≠a-√Ålvarez and J. Lara Hinojosa  | Practical considerations: This dataset was produced by means of a complex production method that is difficult to understand for those without specialist knowledge of radar data. Those wishing to find out more about this dataset should read the guide cited in the specifications above and other information about the dataset available at https://geoservice.dlr.de/web/dataguide/fnf50/.  | Change detection: No (only one date) | Overall accuracy: Expected to be >69% | Website of reference Website Language:  | Not available English: Download site http://ftp-earth.bu.edu/public/friedl/GRIPCmap/?C=S;O=A | Project: Global Rainfed, Irrigated and Paddy Croplands (GRIPC) is a map developed by researchers from German and American universities, who aimed to overcome some of the limitations of previous datasets focusing on irrigated croplands. At the time it was released, the dataset offered an up-to-date representation of irrigated croplands across the world at the highest spatial resolution available. It could be useful for those studying agricultural productivity, agricultural hydrology and food security in general. | Production method: The GRIPC map is made up of 4 different categories.
Uncropped areas were extracted from the non-cropland categories of the MODIS Land Cover database for the period 2004-2006. Paddy croplands were independently mapped from different sources, such as crop inventories, due to the challenges involved in classifying cloudy imagery in the tropics. Rainfed and irrigated cropland were mapped using a decision-tree classification algorithm (C4.5) and the ""boosting"" machine learning technique. MODIS imagery was used as the input for the classification. Climate and agroecozones data were also used as auxiliary datasets. Probability layers obtained from the classification were combined with information from national and subnational cropland inventory-based datasets to finally map the rainfed and irrigated cropland areas. The information from these datasets served to define the probabilities of each category occupying a pixel. Then, the classification results were combined with these probabilities using a Bayes' rule to obtain the final map. | Product description: GRIPC is distributed in 273 tiles, according to the MODIS tile grid.  | Downloads:  | Practical considerations: GRIPC does not map various important irrigated cropland categories, such as deficit irrigation (irrigation occurring less than once a year), permanent crops (orchards and vineyards) and unharvested pastures. As there is no official website describing the GRIPC and its characteristics, users wishing to find out more about this dataset should consult the scientific paper in which it was presented  | GFSAD1KCM and GFSAD1KCD: According to the authors, data about cropping intensity can be obtained from this product using a time-series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data. | Project: The Global Synergy Cropland Map is a dataset created within the framework of the Spatial Production Allocation Model (SPAM), which maps agriculture production across the world. It is a joint effort involving different institutions and universities across the world: AGRIRS, IFPRI Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and Victoria University of Wellington.
The project team aimed to create a more accurate cropland dataset that would be useful for agricultural monitoring and food security policies and studies. The obtained map is a critical input of SPAM. | Production method: A self-adapting statistics allocation model (SASAM) is used to generate the Global Synergy Cropland Map, using LUC datasets at global, supranational and national scales as input, as well as FAO agricultural statistics at national and subnational levels.
Two layers were generated by the model. Firstly, an agreement layer, which shows the level of agreement of all the datasets regarding the location of cropland areas, and secondly, an average cropland percentage layer, obtained by calculating the average of all the input maps. For the agreement layer, datasets with a higher accuracy are given more weight. This accuracy is based on the agreement between each input dataset and the FAO statistics. For the cropland percentage layer, the cropland category definitions in the input maps were translated into cropland percentages.
The final cropland map was obtained after executing the SASAM model, which allocated cropland in the areas with the highest probability in the agreement layer until the total surface area for cropland according to FAO statistics for each country was reached. | Product description: The raster file showing the cropland percentage can be downloaded separately. However, we recommend the full download, which also contains additional information about the dataset, such as its level of confidence. | Downloads: Global synergy cropland map (full download) -Raster file with cropland percentage (.tiff) -Raster file with information about the confidence level of the cropland map (.tiff) -A text file with information about the downloaded product | Legend and codification: Code Label 0-1 Cropland extent percent (0-100%) | Practical considerations: More information about the associated SPAM project is available at www.mapspam.info. The website includes all the spatial datasets about agricultural production generated as part of the project. These complement the information provided by the cropland map reviewed here.
6 UCL-Unified Cropland Layer Project Global Food Security-support Analysis Data 30 metre (GFSAD30) was a project aimed at producing high-resolution cropland maps to inform global food and water security studies and policies. The project sought to overcome some of the limitations presented by previous cropland datasets, such as sources of uncertainty, insufficient precision in the allocation of cropped areas, and a lack of information regarding the intensity and irrigation status of cropland areas. GFSAD30 was the continuation of earlier projects (the GFSAD1KCM and GFSAD1KCD datasets described above) with similar purposes. They all formed part of the MEa-SUREs (Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments) programme, which promotes the use of data from NASA missions to produce innovative products that are useful for research and policy-making.
Various different US institutions (USGS, BAER Institute, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) and universities (New Hampshire, California, Wisconsin, Northern Arizona) took part in the project, together with Google and institutions from other countries (ICRISAT, IAARD).
A global map of cropland extent at a spatial resolution of 30 m for the reference year 2015 was delivered as part of the project. The global map was obtained after merging different maps that had been independently produced for seven different regions across the world. The map for North America was produced for the reference year 2010, instead of 2015. | Production method: GFSAD30 is made up of 7 datasets which were independently produced for different regions across the world: Europe, Middle East, Russia and Central Asia; Africa; Australia, New Zealand, China, and Mongolia; Southeast and Northeast Asia; North America; and South America. Each dataset was produced following a specific production method, although they all share certain common features.
The same imagery source (Landsat) was used for all 7 datasets. Sentinel-2 imagery was also used to map the extent of cropland in Africa. Other auxiliary data, such as elevation data from the SRTM radar, were used for the production of several datasets. In all cases, the extent of cropland was computed using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform.
The classification workflow varies in each case. The most frequent classification method was the random forest algorithm. For some datasets, like Africa, additional classifiers (support vector machines, an object-based classifier) were also used. In addition, in order to take the geographical variability within the mapped area into account, producers usually split the classification into agro-ecological zones (AEZs). | Product description: GFSAD30 is distributed in tiles with a 10¬∫ edge for each of the mapped regions. Datasets are available from different servers or tools, including Data Pool, NASA Earthdata Search, USGS EarthExplorer and the DAAC2Disk Utility. We recommend users to download the dataset through NASA Earthdata Search and USGS EarthExplorer, on which the geographical coverage of each tile can be visualized.
In most cases, the download only includes a raster file with the extent of cropland in .tiff format. Nonetheless, the download from the Data Pool server also includes a metadata file and a preview image of the product.  | Downloads:  | Practical considerations: The global map obtained after merging the 7 GFSAD30 datasets can be consulted online at the project's website.  | Practical considerations: Although not directly available for download, access to the original map at a spatial resolution of 250m is possible on request to the members of the ASAP Team. 6 Previous versions of the dataset for Africa developed by

1 Global Urban Land | Product:  | LULC thematic: Dates  | Project: Global Urban Land, also referred to as Multi-temporal Global Impervious Surface (MGIS), is a project developed by researchers from different Chinese universities (Sun Yat-sen, East China Normal, Guangzhou and Jiangsu Normal) to create a high-resolution multi-temporal urban land dataset. They aimed to provide high-resolution data about urban areas at multiple dates, which could be useful for those studying urbanization and the impact of artificial surfaces and human activities on the environment. In this dataset, urban land is understood as an impervious surface. It can therefore be assimilated to all the datasets mapping artificial or impervious surfaces, such as GAIA. Initially, the dataset was produced for the period 1990-2010, with maps every 5 years. However, it has since been updated, with new data for the years 1980 and 2015. | Production method: Global Urban Land is obtained through an index-based method that automatically predicts urban land: the Normalized Urban Areas Composite Index (NUACI). The index, implemented through the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, uses Landsat imagery and DMSP-OLS nighttime lights images as inputs.
To calibrate the index, the world was stratified into different urban ecoregion categories, according to the particular physical and socioeconomic characteristics of each urban region. Three indexes (NDWI, NDVI and NDBI) were extracted from Landsat imagery to calculate the NUACI. In addition, a binary mask was obtained by segmenting DMSP-OLS nighttime lights images into urban and non-urban by applying a specific threshold. On the basis of these data, the NUACI index was calculated, obtaining a raster showing the percentage of impervious surface area per pixel.
The final Global Urban Land dataset was obtained after applying region-specific segmentation thresholds to the NUACI images showing the degree of imperviousness. After this step, a binary urban/non-urban map was generated.
For the calibration of the NUACI index, as well as for the application of segmentation thresholds, cities were randomly assigned to three equal-sized groups: centroid sites, threshold sites and testing sites. Different criteria for index calibration and threshold segmentation were decided for each type of site. | Product description: The Global Urban Land dataset can be downloaded from three different servers: Baidu Drive, Google Drive and FTP. From them, users will be able to separately download the dataset for each of the available years of reference. For each year, there is a compressed folder (.zip) containing the whole dataset distributed in tiles.
An auxiliary vector file (.shp) is provided to help users identify the number of the files corresponding to their area of interest (field ""grid_id""). The scientific paper presenting the dataset is also available for download, together with a text file with relevant technical information about the product and the reference data used to produce the dataset for the initial period 1990-2010. | Downloads: Global Urban Land 2010 -Raster files with the extent of the artificial surfaces for each tile into which the dataset was divided (.tiff) | Project: The dataset on Global Urban Expansion is the result of the work carried out by a group of researchers from the Beijing Normal University, the China University of Geosciences and Murray State University in the USA. Their aim was to create a new dataset on urban expansion using fully convolutional network (FCN)-based methods, which would be able to overcome some of the limitations of previous datasets on the same topic: outdated datasets, low spatial resolutions and low levels of accuracy.
The dataset provides useful information for studies addressing global urbanization and its impacts on the environment. It considers as urban all those built-up areas where human-constructed or artificial elements cover more than half of the area or pixel. | Production method: A specific fully convolutional network (FCN) was developed to map the urban areas in the Global Urban Expansion dataset. FCN are deep learning structures based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) that employ pixel-to-pixel image recognition.
The FCN was fed with different sources of input data: Nighttime Light (NTL) imagery from NOAA and NPP-VIIRS, as well as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) data from MODIS. Other auxiliary data sources were also employed to obtain the Global Urban Expansion dataset: urban population statistics, Landsat imagery and the GHS and LC-CCI LUC datasets. LST data is only available for the period 2000-2016 and was not used to map the urban areas in 1992 and 1996.
The FCN was calibrated with data from MODIS Land Cover, differentiating urban from non-urban areas. The calibration provided the weights of the FCN, which were then used to obtain the final Global Urban Expansion dataset.
A post-classification stage using population density data was carried out to ensure the consistency over time of the maps obtained. | Product description: The dataset can be downloaded as a single compressed file (. zip), including the raster files showing the urban expansion for each available year. No auxiliary information is provided with the dataset. | Downloads:  | Global Urban Expansion: -Raster files with urban expansion data for each mapped year (.tiff) | Legend and codification: Other complementary products are also available for download: a layer of standard error for the production of the GMIS dataset and an HBASE probability layer.  | Practical considerations: Users can explore the different datasets available online, 4 including the complementary layer about the standard error of the Impervious Surface Percentage raster and the HBASE probability layer. Full metadata for GMIS and HBASE is also available online. 5  GMIS and HBASE have some limitations associated with their production methodology. For example, they may present areas of missing information due to cloud cover or other factors. The technical documents for the product (cited below) provide a detailed description of all these limitations.
As part of the same project, Landsat imagery composites for 66 urban areas are also available for download. 6 4 https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/mapping/gmis-hbase/explore-view/. 5 https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/ulandsat-hbase-v1/metadata .https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/ulandsat-gmis-v1/metadata. 6 https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/ulandsat-cities-from-space.  | Practical considerations: WSF is considered by the authors to be the most accurate dataset of its type. It is part of the U-TEP tool, which also distributes many other datasets for characterizing urban areas that may be of interest to users. Users can access an online visualization of the dataset on the U-TEP tool website.  | GISM-Global Impervious Surface Map:  | Overall accuracy: Expected to be >95%  | Practical considerations: A full characterization of the dataset is provided in the technical report published by the European Commission and in the technical documentation cited above. The map comes with several limitations: a few seasonal monsoon forests in Sulawesi, New Guinea and Philippines were not mapped as an individual category, while degraded forest cover and mature stages of forest regrowth were sometimes mapped as forest. Water and Wetness HRL | Congo Basin Monitoring Maps: The Water and Wetness HRL is made up of a main product mapping the different types of water and wetness covers in Europe. Users can also download an additional layer (Expert products) showing the probability of each pixel being water or wetness. Two extra technical layers are also available as expert products: one informs about the confidence of the 2018 status map (WACL) while the other studies the differences in the mapping of water and wetness covers between 2015 and 2018 (WAWCSL). | Project: The European Settlement Map (ESM) is part of the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) project, supported by the European Commission through the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and the Directorate General for Regional and Urban Policy (DG REGIO). ESM complements the GHSL global products by providing an urban settlement map for Europe at a very detailed spatial resolution: 2-2.5 m versus 30 m for the GHSL. Both products share similar automatic methods for extracting LUC information from satellite imagery. ESM was initially released in 2014, with successive updates in 2016, 2017 and 2019. In 2014, a dataset was created for the reference year 2012, showing the percentage of the surface area that was built up. This was revised with a new production methodology in 2016 and again in 2017. The first update improved the accuracy of the product and its consistency with population data. The spatial resolution was also improved: from 100 to 10 m. The second update increased the spatial and thematic detail of the product, at 2.5 m and differentiating between 12 classes. A new dataset at 2 m for the year 2015 was released in 2019, using a different production methodology. Unlike previous editions, this map only shows the extent of built-up areas, without providing further information about the built-up fraction per pixel.
In addition to the base layer delineating built-up areas, the latest edition of the product (2019) includes a classification differentiating residential from non-residential areas at a spatial resolution of 10 m. | Production method: The ESM production method has changed over time, although it has always been fully automatic. The latest edition (2019) was produced at 2 m on the basis of the Copernicus VHR_IMAGE_2015 imagery dataset, made up of images captured by the satellites Pleiades, Deimos-02, WorldView-2, WorldView-3, GeoEye-01 and Spot 6/7. The imagery was classified through a scene-based classification algorithm: Symbolic Machine Learning (SML).
The first three editions of ESM were obtained at 100, 10 and 2.5 m through a textural and morphological technique of unsupervised built-up area detection. Spot 6/7 imagery was used as an input. In the third edition (2017), auxiliary data sources (Open Street Map, Urban Atlas‚Ä¶) were also used to provide more thematic detail, distinguishing between 13 LUC categories, instead of just between built-up and non-built-up areas. | Product description: The ESM for each of the available editions can be downloaded separately as a single file. If more than one spatial resolution is available, users must separately download the specific product for the spatial resolution they require.
The ESM layers at 100 m for the 2014 and 2016 editions are distributed as a single European file. For the 2017 edition of ESM at 100 m, users must download a different file covering the entire mapped area for each of the categories (13 in total). The 2016 edition at 10 m is also distributed in 400 √Ç 400 km tiles. Finally, the ESM layers at 2-2.5 and 10 m are distributed in 100 √Ç 100 km tiles for the 2017 and 2019 editions of the product. In all cases, users can find out which tile or tiles fall within their area of interest by consulting the viewer available on the ESM website. | Downloads: Due to the complexity of this product, with different editions available for the same years of reference at different spatial resolutions, in the following table we present an overview of all the available maps, classified according to the year they were released, their spatial resolution and the year of reference, i.e. the year for which they map the LUC covers.

Analyzing and Predicting Land Use and Land Cover Changes in New Jersey Using Multi-Layer Perceptron-Markov Chain Model,Ilunga Kikombo; Ngoy; Feng Qi; Daniela Shebitz,"This study analyzed the changes of land use and land cover (LULC) in New Jersey in the United States from 2007 to 2012. The goal was to identify the driving factors of these changes and to project the five-year trend to 2100. LULC data was obtained from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. The original 86 classes were reclassified to 11 classes. Data analysis and projection were performed using TerrSet 2020. Results from 2007 to 2012 showed that the rate of LULC changes was relatively small. Most changes happened to brush/grasslands, mixed forest lands, farmlands and urban/developed lands. Urban/developed lands and the mixed-forest cover gained while farmlands lost. Using a multi-layer perceptron-Markov chain (MLP-MC) model, we projected the 2015 LULC and validated by actual data to produce a 2100 LULC. Changes from 2012 to 2100 showed that urban/developed lands, as well as brush/grasslands, would continue to gain, while farmlands would lose, although the projected landscape texture would likely be identical to the 2012 landscape. Human and natural factors were discussed. It was concluded that the MLP-MC model could be a useful model to predict short-term LULC change. Unexpected factors are likely to interfere in a long-term projection.","Introduction: Land use and land cover are two closely related concepts. Land cover consists of natural or human-related physical features, such as vegetation, soil, water bodies and urbanization identifiable on the Earth's surface. Land use characterizes how humans utilize these features for the purpose of development and/or conservation. Due to the variability in the land cover types, the management or usage of one type of land cover can be handled differently from area to another within the same country or between different countries 
Scientists have attempted to develop a universal classification scheme of land use and land cover (LULC) with no success due to the diversity and complexity of the LULC types worldwide. It has been a general practice to establish classification schemes and attach meanings to the classes at the national, regional or local scales 
Utilizing available remote sensing data, much research has been conducted to monitor LULC changes at different scales around the world and analyze the spatial patterns to study the controlling factors. These factors could be environmental, economic and/or political/administrative, and the results provide useful information to planners and decisionmakers. For instance, a global study analyzed the impacts of humans on LULC change 
Analyses of LULC using remote-sensing data have covered a wide range of areas. For example, using daytime and nighttime remote sensing, a study in China found that over 20 years, rapid urbanization and human migration have shown an overall improvement on the coastal eco-environment conditions 
In recent years, the application of machine-learning methods on LULC modeling has enhanced the modeling capabilities and allowed for predictions of future LULC changes 
Many studies have also used hybrid models to combine strengths of the individual methods. For example, cellular automata (CA)-Markov chain models take advantage of the spatial modeling capability of CA and temporal prediction capability of the Markov chain to predict future LULC changes. In the United States, it was used in a study to predict future distribution of land use in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota 
As the interest of studying LULC with hybrid models such as the MLP-Markov model grows worldwide, it has been relatively less applied in local regions in the United States (US). We believe it is worth extending such study in the many states in the US to study the impact of LULC management where laws and regulations are very different from most other countries. For instance, any change to LULC in the US may be subjected to stricter environmental impact assessments, public hearings or even voting through ballot boxes that could hinder many human-led changes.
Our study extended such applications in a highly urbanized US state to analyze recent LULC change patterns and project into the future. The main difference between our study and the aforementioned studies is that it illustrated a case where strict land use regulations, regional land use planning and sound policies will likely result in balanced land development, protection of natural resources and minimal LULC changes. Additionally, the majority of previous studies that simulated future LULC changes were restricted to relatively smaller areas. Ours covered the entire state and benefitted statewide decision-making regarding land use management and planning. Specific objectives of this study included:  | Materials and Methods:  | Study Area: The state of New Jersey is located on the east coast of the United States of America along the Atlantic Ocean (Figure 
The New Jersey 2020 census results revealed that the population has increased to 9,288,994  | Data: We downloaded LULC datasets from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) through its Bureau of GIS data portal (https://gisdata-njdep.opendata. arcgis.com/, accessed on 1 July 2021). Three years were of interest for this study, including 2007 (Figure 
An initial examination of the downloaded data layers with ArcGIS Pro [47] revealed that the eastern boundaries of the state extended too far into the Atlantic Ocean. We clipped out the extra ocean water to include only the barrier islands along the east coast and a relatively small part of the bay in the south. Further, we grouped the 86 classes into 11 larger classes. The reclassification process consisted of grouping together closely related original classes and creating classes that align with the objectives of this study, which is to study land use change in the context of land development, farm and forest land changes. None of the original classes was excluded except the ocean water that was clipped out. We finally rasterized the data layers and exported to TerrSet 2020  | Method: MLP-Markov chain modeling is integrated in the Land Change Modeler (LCM) module of the TerrSet software 
( | 1) Change Analysis: We analyzed the LULC changes between 2007 and 2012 using the LCM task related to change analysis. First, we overviewed the gains and losses and derived the net change for each class. Next, we focused on the classes with detectable changes. For each of them, we identified the major contributors to these changes. We then used the third order polynomial equation option to analyze the spatial trend of changes. The classes that underwent the most changes were used to generate spatial trend maps. This step was mostly for visualization purposes, so not only the scientific community, but also the decision makers could eventually take appropriate actions to mitigate any potential trend that would likely negatively affect the wellbeing of the entire state's land system. We also created a map of areas that have remained unchanged between 2007 and 2012.
( | 2) Transition potential modeling: The changes identified were transitions from one land cover type to another. We used transition potential modeling in LCM to model the potential of a given land to transition or not to transition from one type to another. To explain the change that occurred from 2007 and 2012, we selected three explanatory variables: distance from disturbed areas, distance away from urban areas and a dummy variable of evidence likelihood transformation. Each variable is captured with a map of the same extent as the study area. The last map was created by determining the relative frequency with which different land cover type occurred within the state that transitioned from 2007 to 2012.
We used the MLP neural network to model the transition potential, which was recommended by the LCM developer as the most robust 
where f is the activation function, N is the number of the neurons, W are the ANN model weights and b is the bias vector.
A binary classification MLP's output is a value between 0 and 1, which could be considered as the probability of the positive target class. Model selection was performed by optimizing the number of hidden layers and the number of hidden neurons per layer of the MLP using training data (Figure 
(3) Change prediction Finally, based on the rates of change from 2007 and 2012 and the transition probabilities, we predicted the land cover in 2015 and 2100 using a MLP-Markov chain model 
The MLP-Markov chain formulas to predict land use change were based on the following equations (Equations ( 
where L(t) and L(t + 1) represent land use status at time t and t + 1 respectively. (0 | m) ) is the transition probability matrix. (4) Model validation: We validated the model by comparing the predicted 2015 land cover to the 2015 classified land use map obtained from NJDEP. We used the built-in validation tool provided in TerrSet (Table  | Name of Component Definition: Disagreement due to quantity P(p) -P(m) The seven mathematical expressions, N(n), N(m), H(m), M(m), K(m), P(m) and P(p), represent the measures of agreement between two maps (2015 LULC classified map and 2015 LULC predicted map). Usually 0
This sequence partitions the interval (0,1) into components of the agreement and disagreement between the reference map and the comparison map. M(m) is the total proportion correct; thus, 1 -M(m) is the total proportion of disagreement between the reference map and the comparison map

The Kappa index of agreement is calculated using Equation 
where P(A) is the number of times the k raters agree and P(E) is the number of times the k raters are expected to agree only by chance 
(5) Land cover analysis
We analyzed the predicted 2100 LULC using four landscape metrics, including fragmentation index, relative richness, diversity and dominance.
Fragmentation index is computed using the following Equation ( 
where M is the number of map regions and N is the number of places. This index ranges from 0.0, for a pattern in which all areal units have been assigned to a single class, to 1.0, when no two contiguous places have been allocated to the same mapping category.

Dominance (D o )

where s = number of habitats observed and P k , = the proportion of the landscape in habitat k. | Results:  | Land Cover Change between 2007 and 2012: From 2007 to 2012, the total LULC types expanded by 12.16 ha and about the same area was lost in the state of New Jersey (Figure 
Contributions to the net gain by mixed-forest cover was from three classes (Figure 
Three maps were generated from our analyses showing the generalized trends of classes with the most changes from 2007 to 2012.

The other two validation methods showed a similar high degree of accuracy between the two maps. The overall accuracy measured using the confusion matrix is 0.91 (or 91%) (Table  | Prediction of Land Use Change in 2100: Figure  | Discussion and Conclusions: Our results from the analysis of 2007-2012 LULC change show that the rate of change in New Jersey in this five-year period is rather small considering the size of our study area. Only two classes had notable spatial expansions. They include urban/developed lands and mixed forest. In many developing countries, such as Kenya or Nepal, the rate is much higher 
In other parts of the world, the rate of LULC change can be extensive. This is especially true in Africa where the population growth rate and the rate of urbanization are very high 
In New Jersey, the office of Land Use Management administers programs that protect and enhance New Jersey's environment through the implementation of state land use regulations, regional land use planning, coastal resource management and funds projects that result in improvements to the quality of the state's environment 
Additionally, two other reasons may explain the slow pace of change. One of them is the slowdown of urban expansion. Gentrification is the process of bringing new residents of a higher socioeconomic status into a low-income neighborhood 
It is important to note that the model captured changes and the drivers of changes in the five-year period from 2007 to 2012 but did not capture other indirect changes ,such as climate change and invasive species that will inevitably have a significant impact on diversity at the species and ecosystem levels during the next century. Our model showed a net decrease in farmland, as well as coniferous and deciduous forests, but an expansion of the mixed forest (with both conifers and deciduous trees). The direct causes of these trends include the abandonment of farms and rapid rural development and urban expansion into the New Jersey Pine Barrens and deciduous forest areas in the northern region of the state 
Our prediction from 2012 to 2100 shows that any increase in the mixed-forest cover is short-lived, and there will be an overall decrease in this habitat type, but an increase in brush/grassland. While our model did not incorporate specific environmental factors that will likely affect habitats throughout the state in the next century, we are able to make assumptions based on conditions that existed during the five-year period from 2007 to 2012. For example, invasive insects have become more prevalent in the past few decades, causing extensive loss of many trees, including hardwoods, such as ash and chestnut, and conifers, including hemlock and pine 
Another important factor that will be intricately linked to ecological shifts that will inevitably occur across the landscape is climate change 
We used a MLP-Markov chain model to predict the future LULC. We predicted the 2015 LULC to validate our model, and it showed high accuracy. It was based on the assumption that the conditions that prevailed in 2012 will continue the same way in the future. Many studies have used similar models to predict short-term LULC change, as there are not many other variables likely to impede in a short period. When projecting a long-term situation, many other unexpected variables will likely interfere. From 2012 to 2100, factors, such as climate change, will likely completely change the environment in New Jersey 
We hope that a similar study will be undertaken in other states in the United States of America. We expect that results may not be the same as in New Jersey. Each state has its own land-use laws that are likely to be different from New Jersey laws [85].

"Addressing uncertainty and bias in land use, land use change, and forestry greenhouse gas inventories",Emily Mcglynn; Serena Li; Michael Berger; Meredith Amend; Kandice Harper,"National greenhouse gas inventories (NGHGIs) will play an increasingly important role in tracking country progress against United Nations (UN) Paris Agreement commitments. Yet uncertainty in land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF) NGHGHI estimates may undermine international confidence in emission reduction claims, particularly for countries that expect forests and agriculture to contribute large near-term GHG reductions. In this paper, we propose an analytical framework for implementing the uncertainty provisions of the UN Paris Agreement Enhanced Transparency Framework, with a view to identifying the largest sources of LULUCF NGHGI uncertainty and prioritizing methodological improvements. Using the USA as a case study, we identify and attribute uncertainty across all US NGHGI LULUCF ""uncertainty elements"" (inputs, parameters, models, and instances of plot-based sampling) and provide GHG flux estimates for omitted inventory categories. The largest sources of uncertainty are distributed across LULUCF inventory categories, underlining the importance of sector-wide analysis: forestry (tree biomass sampling error; tree volume and specific gravity allometric parameters; soil carbon model), cropland and grassland (DayCent model structure and inputs), and settlement (urban tree gross to net carbon sequestration ratio) elements contribute over 90% of uncertainty. Net emissions of 123 MMT CO 2 e could be omitted from the US NGHGI, including Alaskan grassland and wetland soil carbon stock change (90.4 MMT CO 2 ), urban mineral soil carbon stock change (34.7 MMT CO 2 ), and federal cropland and grassland N 2 O (21.8 MMT CO 2 e). We explain how these findings and other ongoing research can support improved LULUCF monitoring and transparency.","Introduction: National greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories (NGHGIs) are the primary tool for tracking anthropogenic (human-induced) GHG emissions at the country, sector, and source category level. Over the coming decade and beyond, NGHGIs will support setting and measuring progress against each country's ""nationally determined contributions"" (NDCs) for reducing GHG emissions under the United Nations (UN) Paris Agreement while also supporting domestic climate policy development and evaluation (UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 2019a; UNFCCC 2019b; 
Yet LULUCF is a large source of uncertainty in estimating anthropogenic GHG emissions 
(1) Transparently reporting on LULUCF NGHGI uncertainty estimation methods, including clarifying which uncertainty elements are accounted for and how LULUCF uncertainty is calculated (2) Identifying the largest uncertainty elements as a first step in prioritizing inventory improvements
In our framework, we identify and attribute uncertainty across all US LULUCF GHG source and sink (collectively, flux) estimates and provide initial GHG flux estimates for omitted inventory categories.  | Evidence of global and national LULUCF uncertainty: LULUCF estimation uncertainty results from a combination of structural and conceptual challenges, including (1) large heterogeneity in fluxes across time and space, driven by complex biological, geochemical, and physical processes combined with variable anthropogenic and natural disturbances; (2) the inability to continuously observe fluxes over time and over large areas; and (3) differences in definitions and accounting methods across countries and studies 
NGHGIs play a useful role in tracking anthropogenic LULUCF GHG emissions. Alternative methods (global land use change bookkeeping models and dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs)) exhibit large multi-model uncertainty for total atmosphere-to-land CO 2 fluxes, with a standard deviation equal to 10% of annual global anthropogenic GHG emissions (4.0 gigatonnes (Gt) CO 2 year -1 on average, 2010-2019) 
However, individual NGHGIs vary widely in quality and precision, which creates challenges in tracking country-level emission trends and therefore NDC progress. The NGHGIs of major emitting countries reviewed in Table 
Furthermore, there is significant heterogeneity in uncertainty estimation methods, making it difficult to compare precision across NGHGIs and to know how well uncertainty values reflect true variance of the flux point estimate. Challenges include not reporting LULUCF uncertainty at all (India, South Korea), not reporting uncertainty for inventory categories (China, Brazil), and, most commonly, providing insufficient information on how 3 IPCC (2006, 2019) NGHGI guidelines recommend that anthropogenic LULUCF GHG fluxes be defined as all GHG fluxes occurring on managed lands, the so-called managed land proxy. Given the objective of NGHGIs to quantify all anthropogenic GHG fluxes, the managed land proxy has recognized flaws, including the presence of naturally occurring GHG fluxes on managed lands (e.g., wildfires) and indirect humaninduced fluxes on unmanaged lands (e.g., methane emissions due to permafrost thaw). However, several rounds of IPCC review have found the managed land proxy to be the most pragmatic approach to delineating anthropogenic emissions in the LULUCF sector. For a useful review of the managed land proxy, see 
Footnote 2 (continued) uncertainties were calculated (no reporting on uncertainty measures for emission factors or activity data; no information on how uncertainty measures were estimated).
The large majority of LULUCF fluxes reported in NGHGIs are calculated using lower order (Tiers 1 and 2) methods, which likely limit accuracy 
To support the Enhanced Transparency Framework, countries can use the methods demonstrated in this paper to both transparently report on NGHGI uncertainty methods and to identify the largest sources of LULUCF uncertainty as a way to prioritize inventory improvements. We use the USA as a case study due to the scale of US LULUCF fluxes (the largest of all Annex I countries,  | Defining and quantifying NGHGI uncertainty: We are interested in a quantitative measure of the potential difference between an NGHGI flux estimate and the true value of the flux being estimated, referred to as model outcome uncertainty or prediction error 
As recommended by 
Previous work has relaxed the unbiasedness assumption by comparing independent calculations for the same inventory category 
Many studies have assessed uncertainty across entire NGHGIs (e.g., 
We look to build on these literature strands in two ways: (1) identifying individual sources of uncertainty which we term ""uncertainty elements,"" for each NGHGI flux estimate, with a goal of resolving uncertainty attribution at a level that is meaningful for setting programmatic, research, and budgetary priorities, and (2) attributing uncertainty across all elements as consistently as possible for the entire LULUCF sector. While for most fluxes we are unable to account for bias, we suggest a measure of NGHGI bias by providing initial estimates of omitted GHG fluxes. | Methods: Our analytical scope aligns with the IPCC 
We describe here the two components of our analysis:
‚Ä¢ Uncertainty attribution: We quantify the contribution of each uncertainty element to the 95% CIs of all relevant LULUCF inventory categories. ‚Ä¢ Omitted flux estimation: We provide initial estimates of known omitted fluxes, using literature review, expert input, and Tier 1 and 2 methods. | Uncertainty attribution: To identify sources of NGHGI uncertainty, we must first justify an uncertainty taxonomy tailored to the LULUCF NGHGI context. Based on the literature review described in SM Sect. 2, chapter 1.2, we define an uncertainty element as an individual input, parameter, model or submodel, and any instance of design-based sampling error. We refer to input, parameter, and model structure uncertainty collectively as model uncertainty, as distinct from sampling error. In some cases, we aggregate uncertainty elements into a group of inputs or parameters for ease of analysis and interpretation.
Given this taxonomy, we review methods for each LULUCF inventory category and identify all uncertainty elements. For inventory categories where it was possible to recalculate the central flux estimate given available data, we attribute uncertainty to each element using the contribution index method (Eq. 1).
Equation 1: Contribution index where i = 1,‚Ä¶,J: refers to uncertainty element i Range(full,k): is inventory category k 95% CI magnitude (97.5th quantile minus 2.5th quantile)
Range(i,k): is inventory category k 95% CI magnitude holding element i at its mean or point estimate Index(i,k): is percentage contribution of element i to Range(full,k) Other methods for uncertainty attribution have been utilized in the literature, including sensitivity analysis 
Where flux estimate recalculation was not possible, due to lack of access to data or methods, we use published uncertainty attribution results or, in the case of Tier 3 cropland and grassland fluxes, expert elicitation. US EPA recognizes expert elicitation as one method for NGHGI quality assurance and uncertainty analysis (US EPA 2002). We tailored US EPA (2002) NGHGI expert elicitation guidance to the objectives of our study (methods described in more detail below).
Uncertainty elements that we identified but were not able to quantify are listed in SM Table 2-1. Table  | Omitted GHG flux estimation: Most of the omitted fluxes identified in this paper are already recognized in the US LULUCF GHG inventory as planned improvements. We identified additional omitted fluxes by reviewing 
(1) For each identified omitted flux, we reviewed the literature to identify activity data and emission factors. The resulting omitted GHG flux estimates are meant to be useful only for purposes of prioritizing future work. | Methods by land use and inventory categories: We briefly summarize the methods used for each LULUCF inventory category here, with further details provided in the SM. Our analysis is based on the 2018 US NGHGI report, which covers inventory years 1990 to 2016 and which was the most complete inventory report available while the majority of our analytical work was completed.
In the SM, we note any significant methodological updates in more recent US NGHGI reports, none of which meaningfully influences our findings. | Forests: Above-and belowground biomass in living and standing dead trees (SM Sect. 2, chapter 2.1): We recalculate the carbon stock change flux and 95% CI for above-and belowground tree biomass and standing dead trees (hereafter, tree biomass), accounting for uncertainty in nine groups of allometric model parameters (Table 
Litter and soil (SM Sect. 2, chapters 2.2 and 2.3): Using literature estimates of mean litter carbon stocks by forest type 
Non-CO 2 from forest fires (SM Sect. 2, chapter 2.4): We recalculate the CH 4 and N 2 O emissions from forest fires and their respective 95% CIs, using Monte Carlo simulation to account for uncertainty from four input variables (burned area, fuel availability, combustion factor, and emission factor) using standard deviations reported in the US NGHGI (2018) and 
Harvested wood products (SM Sect. 2, chapter 2.5): We modify contribution index results from  | Cropland and grassland: The US NGHGI uses consistent methods across many cropland and grassland inventory categories, so we collapse analysis across the two land uses. The US NGHGI uses Tier 3 methods on 78% of managed cropland and grassland soils, and Tiers 1 and 2 on organic soils, federal grasslands, shaley and gravelly soils, and minor crop types.
Carbon stock change, N 2 O, and rice CH 4 on Tier 3 soils (SM Sect. 2, chapter 3.1): It was not possible to recalculate Tier 3 fluxes, due to National Resources Inventory (NRI) dataset confidentiality. Therefore, we use expert elicitation to identify the largest sources of uncertainty stemming from inputs and structure of the biogeochemical model DayCent as well as scaling NRI plot estimates to population area. The expert elicitation included prompts to identify primary research, model development and intermodel comparison, and data priorities for reducing cropland and grassland Tier 3 flux uncertainty. Participation in uncertainty attribution sections of the survey required knowledge of Century, DayCent, or similar biogeochemical soil models and IPCC GHG accounting guidance. Respondents were asked to confirm that they possessed this knowledge before completing the survey. Respondent expertise was concentrated in soil science (87%), biogeochemistry (67%), and the carbon cycle (67%); 53% worked in academia, 33% in government, and the remainder in NGO or private sectors. Details on the expert elicitation protocol and results are provided in the SM Sect. 2, chapter 3.1, and the full expert elicitation survey is available in SM Sect. 3.
Carbon stock change and N 2 O in Tier 1 and 2 soils (SM Sect. 2, chapter 3.2): We apply contribution index results from  | Settlements: Carbon stock change in urban trees (SM Sect. 2, chapter 4.1): We recalculate the CO 2 flux and 95% CI attributable to carbon stock change in urban trees  | Wetlands: The US NGHGI (2018) indicates that there are 43 million hectares of wetlands in the USA, yet GHG fluxes are calculated for only 2.9 million hectares of wetlands. The omission is due to lack of data that would allow for designating non-coastal wetlands as managed (that is, wetlands directly created by human activity or areas where the water level has been artificially altered) (US NGHGI 2018). Due to this data gap, we were not able to estimate omitted wetland fluxes (SM Sect. 2, chapter 5). | Alaska, Hawaii, and US territories: Alaska, Hawaii, and US territories comprise nearly 20% of the total US land base (nearly all of this in Alaska), but they are not completely accounted for in the US NGHGI. The 2019 US NGHGI included forest carbon stock changes in interior Alaska for the first time, an area covering 24.5 million acres (9% of US managed forest area). We provide estimates for omitted fluxes in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico (the largest US territory), based on IPCC (2006) guidance, emission data derived from the US NGHGI  | Results: Uncertainty contribution results are reported as the uncertainty element's contribution index value (%) multiplied by its respective inventory category 95% CI range (MMT CO 2 e). We present the 10 largest sources of uncertainty for each land use category and then collectively show omitted GHG flux results. Complete results for all inventory categories and uncertainty elements are available in the SM. | Forests: The largest source of forest GHG flux uncertainty is design-based sampling error in estimating tree biomass carbon stock change (434.3 MMT CO 2 e) (Table 
While we find that allometric volume coefficients are a large source of forest carbon stock change uncertainty, we were not able to find an empirical estimate of volume coefficient uncertainty. Sensitivity analysis of the coefficient of variation (5%, 10% (base case), and 20%) found that this assumption has large impacts on both the tree biomass Model uncertainty for soil and litter carbon stock change are substantial (together, 91.7 to 288.9 MMT CO 2 e); we report a range for these pools to reflect sensitivity to carbon stock intertemporal covariance (SM Sect. 2, chapters 2.2 and 2.3). | Cropland and grassland: The DayCent model accounts for the vast majority of cropland and grassland soil carbon stock change, agricultural N 2 O, and rice methane uncertainty (Table  | Settlements: Urban tree gross to net sequestration ratio contribution is an order of magnitude larger than any other settlement uncertainty element (Table 
Yard trimmings and food scraps carbon stock change inputs account for less than 12% of settlement GHG flux uncertainty, with negligible contributions from remaining fluxes (carbon stock change on drained organic soils and N 2 O emissions from soil N additions). | Uncertainty attribution synthesis: Our findings suggest higher LULUCF uncertainty in the US NGHGI than is currently reported. While our recalculated uncertainty estimates generally align with reported values, two notable exceptions are forest carbon stock change and cropland and grassland Tier 3 fluxes, where we found 5-27% (with sensitivity to litter and soil carbon stock change uncertainty) and 94% larger CI ranges, respectively. Total LULUCF CI magnitude could be 18-35% higher than US NGHGI (2018) reported values (Fig. 
Higher cropland and grassland Tier 3 uncertainty can be directly attributed to the expert elicitation, which directed respondents to identify the uncertainty contribution from elements not currently accounted for in reported US NGHGI CIs, which ultimately included the two largest DayCent uncertainty elements (soil properties; leaching, runoff, and volatilization) (US NGHGI 2018).
It is less clear whether higher forest carbon stock change uncertainty can be attributed to our choice of analytical region (eastern Texas), including a larger number of uncertainty elements in our analysis, or other assumptions made in our analysis (e.g., intertemporal covariance for litter and soil carbon pools). Accounting for sensitivity to uncertainty contributions from soil and litter carbon stock change and tree biomass volume coefficient A meaningful reduction in US LULUCF uncertainty would require addressing many of the largest elements simultaneously. No single element or element group would reduce the LULUCF CI by more than 10% except for tree biomass sampling error (Fig.  | Omitted fluxes: In total, we find that net emissions of 123 MMT CO 2 e could be omitted from the US NGHGI, with the majority occurring on croplands and grasslands (Fig. 
Emissions from settlement mineral soils are not included in the US NGHGI due to a lack of activity data and emission factors, a challenge that the IPCC acknowledges in allowing this omission as a Tier 1 method 
The US NGHGI does not currently account for indirect and direct N 2 O emissions from federally owned croplands and grasslands with the exception of pasture, range, and paddock (PRP) sources. Assuming that federal croplands and grasslands emit direct and indirect N 2 O at the same per-area rates as non-federal lands, net of PRP N 2 O emissions, we find that this omission could reach 22 MMT CO 2 e.
The largest omitted sink category is microbial methane sequestration in cropland, grassland, and forest soils (-25 MMT CO 2 e). However, we note that the soil methane sink is directly tied to methane's atmospheric lifetime and is likely already incorporated to some extent in methane global warming potential (GWP) values. The IPCC 
We do not provide error bars for these estimates to avoid suggesting precision-as described above, these values are generated using highly simplified assumptions about average GHG fluxes over large areas. Our estimates are meant only to provide a basis for prioritizing research and data collection. | Discussion:  | Comparison to other studies: Our results compare well with US NGHGI Approach 2 key category analysis, which ranks source and sink categories, as defined by UNFCCC common reporting format (CRF) guidelines, by their one-direction 95% CI magnitude 
However, our analysis provides important additional detail. For example, ""Net CO 2 Emissions from Settlements Remaining Settlements"" is the second ranked key category, while our analysis finds that addressing DayCent model uncertainty would have a larger impact than focusing on urban trees. This inconsistency is due to the fact that the Day-Cent model is used across nine different CRF key categories. Thus, uncertainty attribution analysis can usefully focus on highly ranked CRF key categories, as long as crosscutting uncertainty elements are recognized.
It is difficult to compare uncertainty attribution results across studies, since they vary widely in scope and structure. However, our findings are consistent with studies that suggest design-based sampling error outweighs allometric model uncertainty  | Opportunities for inventory improvements: Countries looking to improve LULUCF GHG estimation methods can take advantage of existing research, data gathering, and model development targeting the largest uncertainty elements identified above. | Forest sampling error: Increasing the sampling rate or number of plots in existing forest is a costly option for reducing sampling error. Rather, research has increasingly focused on using remote sensing data like LiDAR or radar to generate wall-to-wall forest biomass estimates (e.g., 
Care must be taken in comparing precision of plot-based and remote sensing-based methods. Countries with national forest inventories tend to use design-based or probability-based statistical inference to estimate forest carbon fluxes, assuming that uncertainty is a function of the probability of selecting a given sample (observations are considered constant). When using remote sensing-based models, analysts may instead choose modelbased inference, assuming that uncertainty is driven by a population probability distribution (observations are realizations of a random variable) (McRoberts 2010). It is not valid to rank precision across the two methods due to different assumptions about the source of randomness 
Annually updated remote sensing data products can help address concerns that land cover and land use changes are not reflected in LULUCF flux estimates, a source of uncertainty that we were not able to evaluate in this paper due to data constraints. For example, the 2018 US NGHGI uses the 2011 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) to stratify eastern Texas forest by canopy cover. Though individual plots could capture disturbance after 2011, spatial weights would reflect only area disturbed prior to 2011. As a result, large changes in US forest GHG fluxes would not be reflected in the inventory for up to five years under current stratification methods. To address this issue, the USA has begun generating annual NLCD updates to more closely monitor land use change (LCMAP 2021, LCMS 2021). | Tree-level biomass estimation: We find a higher contribution from allometric model uncertainty compared to other studies (e.g., 
Tree-level biomass estimates are an important input to remote sensing models and so will be key to inventory methods even as remote sensing data is increasingly utilized. Challenges to allometric model improvements include inconsistent methods in biomass measurement field studies 
In an effort to address some of these challenges, the US Forest Service has compiled the Legacy Tree Data platform, which contains over 15,000 individual tree biomass measurements  | Cropland and grassland fluxes: Our expert elicitation survey asked respondents to rank research, modeling, and data priorities, as identified in the literature, for reducing uncertainty in cropland and grassland Tier 3 GHG flux estimates (SM Table 
Survey respondents noted that they were keen to have more empirical data in order to improve and validate existing soil models 
Survey respondents also indicated that increased collaboration among model developers would help refine soil carbon flux predictions  | Application to other countries: Other countries with similar land cover and NGHGI methods can use US-based uncertainty attribution to inform priorities for further analysis. For example, most of the world's forest area is now covered by strategic forest inventories, with many countries utilizing statistical sampling methods similar to the USA 
There is more international heterogeneity in non-forest flux estimation methods, with many non-Annex I countries omitting these inventory categories entirely  | Conclusion: Many countries have deprioritized NGHGI uncertainty estimation and reporting due to lack of data and programmatic resources, as well as the complexity of uncertainty methods. As Brazil indicated in their Third National Communication (2016), ""Quantifying uncertainty for individual data items is as or more difficult to assess as the actual information sought."" Countries are likely to prioritize improvements in LULUCF accuracy by increasing the use of Tier 3 methods and updating Tier 1 and 2 methods with the most recent science 
NGHGI LULUCF uncertainty is a challenge for many major emitting countries and, for some, including the USA, is large enough that planned LULUCF emission reductions fall within the margin of estimation error. The analytical framework suggested here is one approach that governments can use to both transparently report uncertainty estimation methods and to identify opportunities for improving NGHGI accuracy and precision, with a view to increasing international confidence in NDC emission reduction progress.
Using the USA as a case study, we detail the contribution of over 90 LULUCF uncertainty elements and omitted fluxes to uncertainty and bias in the US NGHGI. Most inventory uncertainty is driven by a small set of elements distributed across forestry, cropland and grassland, and settlement land use categories. Omitted fluxes could account for up to 13% of the current LULUCF inventory on an absolute value basis, primarily driven by CO 2 and CH 4 emissions in Alaska and urban mineral soils. Other countries can use these results to inform initial priorities for further analysis, particularly those using similar NGHGI methods or those that plan to take up similar methods in the future.","National forest carbon inventories: policy needs and assessment capacity (, 2008) || Geostatistical estimation of forest biomass in interior Alaska combining Landsat-derived tree cover, sampled airborne Lidar and field observations (, 2018.

These may include changes in total suspended sediment and nutrient concentration  | J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f: However, most SWAT model applications assessed the hydrological impacts based on static LULC data 
The Anzali wetland catchment in Iran contains ecologically significant ecosystems such as the Anzali wetland and the Hyrcanian forests. It is also one of the important rice-growing regions of Iran. In recent decades the catchment has been subjected to environmental issues like urban sprawl and gradual land degradation  | Materials and methods:  | Study area: The catchment of the Anzali wetland is located in the Gilan province of Iran on the southern coast of the Caspian Sea (36 ‚Ä¢ 54'-37 ‚Ä¢ 28' N, 48 ‚Ä¢ 48'-49 ‚Ä¢ 37' E; fig. 
The Anzali wetland catchment is composed of two types of landforms; a lowland area in the north-east and a mountainous area in the south-west. The land use of the catchment is dominated by agricultural land with fertile and productive soil types at lower elevations. About 70% of the agricultural area is under rice plantation and the remaining is mostly rain-fed agriculture.
Hyrcanian forests are mostly at higher elevations and grassland can be found on the western and southern borders of the catchment. Urban area is scattered mainly from the east where the capital Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f city of the state, Rasht, is located, to the center of the catchment in proximity to areas that are suitable for agriculture. Water for irrigation agriculture is mainly provided by surface water.
Approximately 80% of the irrigation water is transferred to the catchment from the Sefidrood river through two diversion dams which transfer water to two main irrigation canals (Fig. 
To process the satellite data and quantitatively assess LULC change in the study area, ArcGIS and ERDAS Imagine software were used. All the images were resampled to 30 m * 30 m pixel resolution using nearest neighbor resampling to preserve the original image radiometry 
Ground truth (200 points) from a field survey and from a land use map of the Plan and Budget Organization of Iran (PBO, 2013) was used for supervised LULC classification and accuracy assessment of the classification results. The Crosta method was used for False Color Composite (FCC) creation of training areas 
The overall classification accuracy was 91% for 1990, 88.2% for 2000, and 85.8% for 2013. The Kappa coefficients of 0.90, 0.87, and 0.85 denote an almost perfect inter-rater agreement for the classified maps 
Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f | Hydrologic modeling: In this study, the GIS interface ArcSWAT-2012 was used to set up a SWAT model of the Anzali wetland catchment. The SWAT model 
Model calculations are based on hydrologic response units (HRUs) representing lumped areas with a unique land use, soil, and slope class combination within a sub-basin. The following data inputs are used to set up the SWAT model: a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with a spatial resolution of 30 m was derived from ASTER satellite data (GDEM V 2 ), soil spatial distribution data and soil parameters were obtained from the global soil map of the Food and Agriculture Organization 
Management operations for rice and orchards as derived from field work and expert knowledge were set up in the SWAT model (Table 
Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Table 
As daily streamflow data were not available for all of the hydrological stations, monthly streamflow data from eleven hydrological stations were used. This data covers both landforms in the catchment, i.e. the lowland areas and the mountain areas (Fig. 
To study the hydrological impacts of LULC change in the Anzali wetland catchment, two different model runs were set up: a static model run using the LULC of 1990 and a dynamic model run using land use updates. For this purpose, the Land Use Update tool (LUU) 
Then, HRU-fractions for each year of the simulation period were calculated using a linear interpolation of annual land use change from 1990 to 2000 and 2000 to 2013.
The Anzali wetland catchment consists of nine main streams that drain into the Anzali wetland.
We used two SWAT models, one for the northern and another one for the southern streams, to model the entire catchment, which allows us to better represent the entire catchment. Based on the DEM, land use, and soil data, the Anzali wetland catchment was divided into 30/34 subbasins and 822/1004 HRUs in the two delineated sub-catchments. The entire Anzali wetland catchment consists of 64 sub-basins and 1826 HRUs.
After the setup and delineation of the static LULC model in ArcSWAT, a sensitivity analysis was performed in SWAT-CUP 
Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f local (one-at-a-time) sensitivity analysis 
For the SWAT model with dynamic LULC updates, we used the same parameters as derived from the calibration of the static model. To assess the impacts of LULC changes, we compared the results from the dynamic model to the static baseline model. With this modeling approach hydrologic response is isolated to a single variable (LULC change), so that the differences in the static and dynamic model outputs is a result of LULC change. The same method was used in similar studies (e.g.,  | Results and discussion:  | LULC change analysis: In the year 1990, the upper part of the Anzali wetland catchment is dominated by forest (45.8%), followed by agricultural land (40.8%) in the middle and lower part. Grassland covers 8% and is mostly found at the border of the forest coverage. Wetland, water, and urban areas accounted for 2.5%, 1.4%, and 1.5% of the catchment in 1990. The spatial distribution of the major LULC classes in 1990, 2000, and 2013 is shown in the supplementary document.
Comparing the LULC data of the years 1990, 2000, and 2013, the most obvious LULC changes occurred in the agricultural and forest land use classes (Table 
(177.8km¬≤), 12.5% was grassland (29.3 km¬≤), and 11.4% was wetland (26.7 km¬≤). Forest, grassland and wetland showed a decline by -6.8% (227.4 km 2 ), -1.0% (33.4 km 2 ), and -0.7% of the catchment area (23.4 km 2 ), respectively. Most of the lost forest area was converted to agriculture (91%) and about 9% was converted to grassland. The lost wetland was entirely (100% of the area) converted for agricultural purposes. The water area of the catchment is assumed to remain constant during the study period.
Urban area changed the most in relative terms among all the LULC classes, increasing to 100% in 2013 as compared to 1990. However, the expansion of the urban class is not substantial with respect to the total area of the catchment, i.e., an increase of 1.5% (50.2 km 2 ).

Among the parameters, the peak rate adjustment factor for sediment routing in the sub-basin (ADJ_PKR) was the most sensitive, followed by the USLE support practice factor (USLE_P), sediment concentration in lateral flow and groundwater flow (LAT_SED), and the USLE soil erodibility factor (USLE_K).

The difference in the hydrological response between the two applied models provide the isolated impact of land use change. The differences in the long-term average annual values for water balance components are smaller than 10 mm on the catchment scale. The estimated ET, WYLD, and SURQ in the dynamic land use model increased by 0.9%, 1%, and 2.8%, respectively. Total sediment loading is also increased by 2.6% (3 t/km 2 ) through the dynamic land use model. A possible reason for the increase in ET is the conversion of forest to irrigated paddy fields. Also, a positive impact on SURQ and WYLD can be observed as almost 80% of the irrigation water for the expanded rice fields are taken from outside the catchment (Sefidrood river). The slight decrease in groundwater flow and lateral flow can be attributed to less soil infiltration and more surface runoff 
It is a commonly known effect that impacts of LULC change are small when aggregated in space and time 
Revap is the amount of water moving from shallow aquifer to plants/soil profile in the catchment | Hydrological response at the sub-basin scale: The effect of dynamic land use change on the hydrological response was more discernible on the sub-basin scale. To relate the magnitude and direction of these changes to the changes in land use data, spatial distribution of the main land use changes at sub-basin level between 1990 and 2013 were assessed (Fig.  | Hydrological response at the seasonal time scale: The following analysis is focused on the monthly time scale impacts of land use change as more distinct differences in water balance components can be identified from the continuous land use changes. Seasonal responses to land use change have been identified in some other studies (e.g., 
In both sub-basins, small differences are observed in the early years of the study period, while more pronounced seasonal patterns are generated with the increase of the magnitude of land use changes towards the end of the simulation period. In sub-basin 16, ET increases by up to 17.2 mm in dry season (April-August) and decreases by up to -2.7 mm in the wet season (September-February). The increase of ET is due to the increased irrigated agriculture 
The decrease of ET shows the ability of forests to produce higher values of ET during the nonirrigated months than the agriculture. 
In sub-basin 16, the expanded agriculture area resulted in an increase of WYLD by up to 17.6 mm in July 2012. The most significant changes of WYLD occur in the dry season as a consequence of the water withdrawal for the irrigation activities. The increased WYLD leads to a higher sedimentation rates during the irrigated months. The largest variation in SYLD is observed in October 2013 (+2.8 t/km 2 ). 
In those sub-basins where the agriculture area increases at the expense of wetland area (e.g., sub- expected, as irrigation water does not add to WYLD anymore. In sub-basin 8, a similar pattern of WYLD responses were observed for the SYLD. The highest differences of SYDL is -7 t/km 2 in September 2011, where the WYLD is also decreased by -5.2 mm. However, no discernable changes were observed for the SYDL during the non-irrigated months, since no significant changes were observed for WYLD as well.
Similar results are presented in some other studies. For example, in a study conducted in the Bochung catchment in Korea, 
For the first time, hydrological modeling was conducted for the Anzali wetland catchment to assess the impacts of dynamic land use change on spatio-temporal changes in hydrological fluxes of the catchment.

Spatio-temporal impact assessment of land use / land cover (LU-LC) change on land surface temperatures over Jaipur city in India,Neha Gupta; Aneesh Mathew; Sumit Khandelwal; Aneesh Contact; Mathew,"Urban development has consequently given rise to the empirically observed phenomenon of the urban heat island (UHI). The article aims to determine the change in land surface temperature (LST) over Jaipur study area during the period from 2008 to 2011 and analyzes the spatial variation of LST in the context of changes in land use/ land cover (LU-LC). The LST has been retrieved from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images for the years 2008 and 2011 to find the variation of LST as per the LU-LC classes. Results show a significant rise in temperature for all LU-LC categories during the study period. The percentage impervious surface area (ISA) pattern of these classes has also been analyzed for both the years, and a rising trend in ISA for different LU-LC categories has been observed; showing that Jaipur city has witnessed substantial growth in built-up area at the cost of greener patches and open land at a fast pace having a clear impact on LST variation. The average rise in temperature during winter season was found to be around 2.6 ¬∞C while 1.47 ¬∞C rise was observed during summers. Inter-seasonal variations of LST on different LU-LC over Jaipur have been analyzed.","Introduction: Urbanization causes various environmental issues like air pollution, global warming, an increase in energy demand and environmental degradation, which negatively affect the comfort and quality of urban living of the inhabitants 
LST is one of the important parameters for SUHI assessment 
Urbanization is one of the primary driving factors of LC changes and subsequently increases LST 
A lot of research has been carried out for analyzing the association of LST with various surface and other physical characteristics of urban areas. Most of this research has been carried out for developed countries as well as for cities in cold climates and limited research is available for cities of hot and arid regions. The reference literature available for Indian conditions is also limited.
In the present times, when the entire globe is reeling under the impacts of climate change, studies of such nature might prove to be helpful in generating substantial knowledge about the UHI phenomenon, which might be further used in developing strategies for mitigating its effects on the global climate. Hence, it is very important to explore the relationship of LST with various parameters representing vegetation, urbanization, soil, and water. The proposed research is a step towards increasing the understanding of the UHI and the factors responsible for it. The study will also help in the quantification of the effect of these factors on UHI effect. | Scientific relevance of this research: LU-LC change and its temperature analysis have always revealed interesting information about the major heat contributing landform. Integration of methods and techniques from multi-disciplinary fields like Geographic Information System (GIS), Remote Sensing, Urban Geography and Computer Science and remote sensing data along with collateral data help in analyzing the LU-LC change and temperature corresponding to the individual landform. Present work is aimed to form LU-LC change map and assessment of temperature related to various LC seasonally and over the span of time. Major cities have witnessed and are still foreseeing a large-scale development due to infrastructural growth, industrial settlement, and tourism. These rapid changes have therefore resulted in increased land consumption, which causes the modification and alterations in the status of LU-LC and the temperature pattern associated with them. Hence, the imperviousness associated with different landform are analyzed as %ISA and are associated with LST of various LC. No detailed and comprehensive study has been done to study inter-seasonal variations of surface temperature of different LU-LC. This article is a preliminary attempt to fill this research gap. Night-time images are advantageous for LST prediction as there is no direct solar interaction and thus no dependence on the solar zenith angle  | Materials and methodology:  | Study area: Jaipur (capital of the Rajasthan state in Northern India) is the 10 th largest city in India with geographical coordinates as 26¬∞25 π to 27¬∞51 π north latitude and 74¬∞55 π to 76¬∞10 π east longitude. In 2001, the urban population of Jaipur city was 2.3 million which has increased to 3.07 million in 2011 (Census of India 2011). Being heading to a metropolitan from developing city, Jaipur has been selected as the study area (Figure 
With varied topography; having Nahargarh hills in the north and Jhalana (a part of Aravalli hills) in the East, the growth of built-up area has been boosted mainly in the south, southwest and west. | Input data:  | For lands use/land cover classification: The multispectral cloud-free satellite imagery used for the present study has been procured from the website of United States Geological Survey (USGS). Land cloud coverage of the images is less than 10%. Table  | For land surface temperature calculation: Available MODIS (Aqua) data for the year 2008 and 2011 for Jaipur have been downloaded from the website of LP DACC with the following specification 
The MODIS data are in HDF-EOS format and in Sinusoidal Projection System. Images were pre-processed using MODIS Re-Projection Tools (MRT) and are re-projected from Sinusoidal projection to UTM Zone 43N projection system with WGS84 as datum and reformatted from HDF-EOS to GeoTIFF format. A total of 40 images of night-time LST of summer (mid of March to June end) and winter season (November to February) with less than 10% cloud cover for two different stretches of time  | For ISA calculation: Landsat TM image of June 2008 and February 2011 have been selected for %ISA calculation. These images have been geometrically rectified to the Universal Traverse Mercator (UTM) projection system (datum WGS 84, Zone 43). The ground control points have been carefully selected to make sure that the RMS errors lies below 0.5 pixels. | Methodology:  | Data acquisition and scanning: Cloud free remote sensing data has been collected from various sources. Hard copy maps such as SOI topo sheet and Master plan of the three cities have been converted to digital maps by scanning in Joint Photographic Expert Group (JPEG) format.   | LU-LC classification system: There are generally two kinds of classifications (1) Unsupervised Classification (2) Supervised Classification. The first type of classification involves just giving the number of classes to the software in which one wants to classify the land use classes. It is an experimental approach to classification. On the other hand, supervised classification requires some kind of supervision from users in the form of training samples. In this method, training samples are collected by the user for the training of classification algorithm. Supervised classification using Maximum Likelihood Classifier has been performed on a combination of bands on both images to map the land cover of the study area during both the years using ERDAS Imagine (Leica Geosystems Inc.).
2.3.4.1. Satellite imageries processing. Image rectification, data layer stacking to prepare false color composites (FCC) and resolution merge have been used to pre-process all the satellite imageries. Spectral profiles were generated to identify the differentiable LU-LC classes and separability of these classes in different spectral bands. Seven broad LU-LC types so identified are residential, commercial, industrial, roads, vegetation, soil (barren and loose soil), and water bodies. | Training of classification algorithm.: Supervised classification requires training of classification algorithm for which training samples also known as signatures are needed to be collected for each targeted LU-LC class based on the prior knowledge of these classes. After selecting pixels for each class, separability matrix has been generated to find the optimum band combination in which all the LU-LC classes are separable for all the satellite imageries. Separability matrix evaluates the TD (Transformed Divergence) values for each class in different band combinations. Band combination with maximum TD value indicates the highest separability between the various LU-LC classes. Contingency matrix is generated and analyzed to check the misclassification among selected training pixels. It checks whether pixels selected for any particular class falls in other classes or not. If the percentage of error in the matrix is high, then signatures need to be refined. Histogram plotting is another way of examining the training samples for all the classes. | Evaluating impervious surfaces of the study area: Extraction of impervious surfaces at the subpixel level can be done by using the linear spectral mixture analysis 
2.3.5.1. Water body masking. Modified Normalized difference water indices (MNDWI) have been used to extract water bodies from remote sensing data 
Where, R GREEN = reflectance in green band R MIR = reflectance in mid infrared band 2.3.5.2. MNF transform. The maximum noise fraction (MNF) transformation places most of the variances of the spectral bands into the first two or three resultant components. It is an improved variant of Principle Component Analysis (PCA) by ordering components according to Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR) 
2.3.5.3. Linear spectral unmixing. In order to perform linear unmixing model for the LMSA, four types of end members are selected in the present study: vegetation, low albedo, high albedo and soil by composing a scatter plot using the first two MNF components. Finally, constrained mixture spectral analysis has been used to process the pixel values of the masked image with the end member spectra. In the linear spectral unmixing model, the spectral value of an image pixel can be treated as a linear combination of different types of end members.   | Result and discussion:  | Image classification: Since the kappa value of the images lies between 0.80-0.85; the classification results have been accepted for further analysis.  | Spatial patterns of LU-LC:  | LST pattern and UHI intensity of Jaipur study area:  | Temperature variations for different land cover types: The best way to understand the influence and contribution of LU-LC on LST is to investigate the connection between the thermal signatures (i.e., the LST profile of the study area) and individual land cover type, 
In this study, it has been observed that LST is showing higher values even with an increment in vegetation coverage. It is also observed that vegetation increment mainly observed in the Eastern part of the study area (Aravalli hill ranges). Aravalli hill ranges comprise of exposed rocks. Even the Aravalli hill ranges covered with vegetation cover, the exposed rocks  which have caused direct exposure of rocky area to sunlight. This will result in higher LST over the area due to the presence of exposed rocks which increase the ISA over the area also. During night, water bodies' thermal characteristics are similar to built-up areas.
Water bodies show higher LST especially during night because whatever the thermal energy absorbed during day period will emit during the night period to maintain the thermal equilibrium. In this aspect, water features showed increased LSTs, also as the water area increased, LST range also increased.  The overall absolute maximum and minimum value obtained are 100 and 0% while the range between 0 and 100 shows imperviousness increasing from 0 to 100. The area with blue color represents the high imperviousness within the urban boundary, which seems to have enhanced over the period of time. The imperviousness in the form of % ISA has been obtained for both the years, since the scale value for both the LU-LC map and imperviousness map are same; the extraction of information could be easily carried out.

"Modeling and Prediction of Land Use Land Cover Change Dynamics Based on Land Change Modeler (LCM) in Nashe Watershed, Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia",Megersa Kebede; Tamene Demissie; Jens Tr√§nckner; Susana Mart√≠n-Fern√°ndez,"Change of land use land cover (LULC) has been known globally as an essential driver of environmental change. Assessment of LULC change is the most precise method to comprehend the past land use, types of changes to be estimated, the forces and developments behind the changes. The aim of the study was to assess the temporal and spatial LULC dynamics of the past and to predict the future using Landsat images and LCM (Land Change Modeler) by considering the drivers of LULC dynamics. The research was conducted in Nashe watershed (Ethiopia) which is the main tributary of the Upper Blue Nile basin. The total watershed area is 94,578 ha. The Landsat imagery from 2019, 2005, and 1990  was used for evaluating and predicting the spatiotemporal distributions of LULC changes. The future LULC image prediction has been generated depending on the historical trends of LULC changes for the years 2035 and 2050. LCM integrated in TerrSet Geospatial Monitoring and Modeling System assimilated with MLP and CA-Markov chain have been used for monitoring, assessment of change, and future projections. Markov chain was used to generate transition probability matrices between LULC classes and cellular automata were used to predict the LULC map. Validation of the predicted LULC map of 2019 was conducted successfully with the actual LULC map. The validation accuracy was determined using the Kappa statistics and agreement/disagreement marks. The results of the historical LULC depicted that forest land, grass land, and range land are the most affected types of land use. The agricultural land in 1990 was 41,587.21 ha which increased to 57,868.95 ha in 2019 with an average growth rate of 39.15%. The forest land, range land, and grass land declined annually with rates of 48.38%, 19.58%, and 26.23%, respectively. The predicted LULC map shows that the forest cover will further degrade from 16.94% in 2019 to 8.07% in 2050, while agricultural land would be expanded to 69,021.20 ha and 69,264.44 ha in 2035 and 2050 from 57,868.95 ha in 2019. The findings of this investigation indicate an expected rapid change in LULC for the coming years. Converting the forest area, range land, and grass land into other land uses, especially to agricultural land, is the main LULC change in the future. Measures should be implemented to achieve rational use of agricultural land and the forest conversion needs to be well managed.","Introduction: Land use land cover (LULC) change occurs under a variety of pressure and it is the result of changes or modifications in the intensity of an existing LULC type to determine the location and nature of the land use change. The changes of LULC have been perceived as worldwide environmental change drivers in the watershed that are very sensitive to LULC dynamics 
The LULC changes were broadly assessed in various areas of the world, for instance, Europe and USA 
The dynamics of LULC intensities and rates are changing because they are highly associated with the overexploitation of natural resources. The natural variability issues like climate change, soil conditions, and terrain characteristics have also accounted for land use changes 
The drivers' assessment and predicting their future LULC status in the watershed is expected to have an essential contribution for land use planning management and sustainable water resources. The use of historical satellite imageries are used to effectively monitor and analyze LULC change 
Models of land change are useful tools for environmental and other types of research concerning LULC change 
The model predicts future LULC images based upon MLPNN (Multi-Layer Perceptron neural networks) and CA-Markov Chain (CA-MC) 
Remote sensing data particularly Landsat images provide suitable possibility for LULC change monitoring, particularly for developing countries where geospatial technologies are not well developed 
Due to changes of LULC, Ethiopia experienced serious environmental problems including soil erosion, land degradation, loss of soil fertility, and deforestation 
The above research questions are so significant and addressed in this study of watershed since a dramatic socio-economic change with expected enormous effect on the land use is undergoing and this will influence various hydrological processes. Thus, especially in the UBNB, those changes need to be predicted in time for environmental management in this area in an effective and sustainable manner. The study findings are utilized to provide empirical evidence on patterns and rates and identify major driving forces of LULC dynamics at watershed level, and improve policies in land use within the framework of sustainable land use planning in relation to future changes or development. | Materials and Methods:  | Study Area: The Upper Blue Nile Basin (UBNB) is the main stream of the Nile basin and is located within the western and central part of Ethiopia between latitudes 7 ‚Ä¢ 45 and 12 ‚Ä¢ 45 N and longitudes 34 ‚Ä¢ 05 to 39 ‚Ä¢ 45 E. The UBNB consists of the major part of Ethiopia and covers an area of 157,000 km 2 . The basin is located within the region of Oromia, Amhara and Benishangul-Gumuz of Ethiopia. The basin has three main seasons: a main rainy season which occurs between June and September, a dry season from October to January, and a short rainy season between February and May. The basin mean yearly rainfall ranges within 800-2000 mm and increases with altitude. The Nashe watershed is the major tributary from the left bank within the UBNB of Ethiopia which is situated at about 300 km from Addis Ababa. The sub-basin lies in between 9 ‚Ä¢ 35 and 9 ‚Ä¢ 52 N latitudes and 37 ‚Ä¢ 00 and 37 ‚Ä¢ 20 E longitudes (Figure  | Data Types and Sources: The important spatial data required for the study were Digital Elevation Model, Landsat Images, and field data. The three Landsat images used were downloaded from the USGS (http://glovis.usgs.gov/, accessed on 2 January 2017) (Table 
The coordinates of each location selected were marked with GPS, and these points were verified in Google Earth. During field survey and data collection, socioeconomic The watershed area varies in elevation from 1600 m in the lower plateau under the escarpment to the hills and ridges of the highland climbing to over 2500 m. The annual average rainfall of the Nashe watershed ranges from 1200 mm to 1600 mm (depending on data from five weather stations); June, July, August, and September are the main rainy season of the catchment. The observed average temperature of the catchment is 22 ‚Ä¢ C. The watershed area is categorized by intensive irrigable lands at the downstream, large water potential sites at the upstream, and also with high head of hydropower potential. Agriculture is the leading financial activity in the watershed and the main source of livelihood for the local population. | Data Types and Sources: The important spatial data required for the study were Digital Elevation Model, Landsat Images, and field data. The three Landsat images used were downloaded from the USGS (http://glovis.usgs.gov/, accessed on 2 January 2017) (Table  | Land Use and Land Cover Change Assessment 2.3.1. Image Classification: The classification of images is to categorize automatically all pixels from the Landsat images into LULC classes to extract useful thematic information  | LULC Types Description:  | Agricultural Land: Includes areas used for perennial and annual crops, irrigated areas, scattered rural settlements, commercial farms (sesame cultivations and sugarcane plantations). | Forest Land: Areas covered with dense trees (deciduous forests, evergreen forests, mixed forests). | Range Land: Includes areas covered with small trees, less dense forests, bushes, and shrubs. These areas are less dense than forests. | Grass Land: Areas covered by grasses are usually used for grazing and those remain for some months in a year. | Urban Area: Areas of commercial areas, urban and rural settlements, industrial areas. | Water Body Areas covered by rivers, streams, and reservoirs: To accomplish classification of image in multi-temporal approach and for mapping purposes, the ERDAS Imagine 2015 and ArcGIS 10.3 software were used, respectively. For each LULC, as many as possible training samples were selected throughout the entire image, based on the composite images, as well as Google Earth images. For classification, verification, and validation of the classified images, the training data were used. | Accuracy Assessment: Accuracy assessment tells us to what extent the ground truth is represented on the equivalent classified image. Since land use maps derived from image classification usually contain some errors, the accuracy of classification results obtained must be assessed. Assessing the classification accuracy provides the degree of confidence in the results and the subsequent change detection 
The common and most effective method used to measure the accuracy of the classified image from remotely sensed imagery is an error/confusion matrix 
where r-rows number in the matrix, Xii-number of observations in row i and column i (the diagonal elements), X + i and Xi+-the marginal totals of row i and column I, respectively, and N-observations number. | Land Use Land Cover Change Drivers: Driving factors influence LULC changes. LULC changes are driven by natural and human activities 
The evidence likelihood is an empirical probability of change in the LULC categories between an earlier and a later map  | LULC Change Prediction and Validation:  | LULC Prediction: The LCM (Land Change Modeler) embedded in the TerrSet Geospatial Monitoring and Modeling System (TGMMS) software was used for prediction of future LULC for a specified year based on the classified historical satellite images. The LCM determines how the factors influence future LULC change, how much land cover change took place between earlier and later LULC, and then calculates a relative amount of transitions 
The trend variations of LULC changes for the years 1990, 2005, and 2019 were analyzed to predict future years of the watershed. The future land use scenarios were based on recent trends, historical land use information, and anticipated future changes. The LCM uses the ""change analysis"" tab, the ""transition potentials"" tab, and the ""change prediction"" tab. The change rates were determined through the ""change analysis"" tab, along with the ""transition potential"" maps to simulate the future scenario. The LCM module allows three different approaches to produce maps of transition potential based on the individual sub-models and associated explanatory variables: multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network, logistic regression, and a similarity-weighted instance-based machine learning tool (SimWeight) 
The TerrSet model uses CA-MC which is a stochastic modeling process to simulate the future changing over time from past changes 
where 0 ‚â§ Pij < 1 and
The cellular automata model can be expressed by the following equation:
where S (t) and S (t+1) are the system status at times t and t + 1, respectively, N-cellular field, t and t + 1 are the different times, f-transformation rule of cellular states in local space, S-the set of limited and discrete cellular states, Pij-the transition probability matrix in a state.
The CA-Markov considers constraints and factors to prepare a single map of suitability  | Model Validation: Validation is simply a procedure to assess the quality of the predicted LULC map against a reference map 
The map shows areas where the model correctly predicted called ""hits"", areas where the model predicted change but it actually did not occur called ""false alarms"", and occasions where the model was unable to predict it, but areas are changed in reality, called ""misses"". After the model prediction capacity was verified between the 1990 and 2005 time periods for 2019, the simulation process was repeated to project the 2035 and 2050 map using 2005 and 2019 classified maps. The other method is the kappa coefficient calculation between the predicted map and actual land use map 
The overall agreement of the projected and reference map indicates the Kappa for no information (Kno). The location kappa (Klocation) is used to compute the spatial accuracy in the overall landscape, because of the correct assignment values in each category between the simulated and reference map  | Analysis of Land Use Land Cover Change: The change of LULC assessment was computed using the LCM model. Different LULC categories of quantitative assessment, net change of LULC categories, and the contributors to the net change experienced by each LULC class are the three sections of results identified in the LCM. Change analysis was performed by using the classified maps  | Percent of change =: Ay -Ax Ax * 100
Rate of change (ha/year) = Ay -Ax T
where Ax is the area of LULC (ha) of an earlier land cover image, Ay is the area of LULC (ha) of a later land cover image, T is the time interval between Ax and Ay in years. | Results and Discussions:  | Accuracy Assessment of the Classified Images: The assessment of accuracy was performed for LULC change analysis by generating confusion/error matrix in each LULC category of 1990, 2005, and 2019 classified maps. The overall accuracy, kappa statistics, producer's and user's accuracy have been used for assessment. The kappa statistics and overall accuracy of classified images shows 91.43%, 87.59%, 85.71% and 0.93, 0.90, and 0.88 for the years 2019, 2005, and 1990, respectively (Table 
The accuracy assessment of LULC is required in any study using remote sensing Landsat data for the historical LULC. According to the authors of  | LULC Change Analysis: The change of the LULC analysis was through evaluation of gains, net change, and losses experienced by different categories using change analysis in LCM. The evaluation of spatial and temporal changes between various classes during the period 1990, 2005, and 2019 was analyzed (Figure  | LULC Change Analysis: The change of the LULC analysis was through evaluation of gains, net change, and losses experienced by different categories using change analysis in LCM. The evaluation of spatial and temporal changes between various classes during the period 1990, 2005, and 2019 was analyzed (Figure 
Although forest land, range land, and grass land experienced reduction in coverage throughout the study periods, the greatest reduction rate was observed in forest land. To mitigate the rapid rates of LULC conversions at watershed, the application of integrated watershed management strategies, managing the rapid population growth, afforestation of degraded or deforested areas, and reducing the dependency of locals on forest products is critically important. The findings of the study are consistent with other studies conducted in Ethiopia by the authors of  | Driver Variables of LULC Change: The driver variables influencing changes are based on spatial analysis and added to the model either as static or dynamic components

From Table  | Transition Probability Matrix (TPM): Transition potential modeling is assessing the likelihood of LULC change from one class to another depending on the suitability transition of area and the presence of driving forces 
In 2005-2019, especially since 2012, a dam on Nashe River was built for irrigation and hydropower purposes. The water body has increased. The displacement of communities occurred from their land during the expansion of hydropower projects and the displacement caused land scarcity. The lowland areas of the watershed was covered with forests, range lands, and grass lands before 1990 even before 2005. Currently, however, a great decline of forest cover is occurring because of urbanization and agricultural land expansion. In recent times, the expansion of urban areas has been continuously increasing at the highest rate.
The findings of the study show that urban area increase was consistent with other research findings in Africa  | Validation of the Model: The agreement of the two categorical maps was measured by using Validation Module. In order to assess the accuracy, validation of the model is necessary. Validation is significant as it allows to determine the quality of the predicted land cover map with actual map. A comparison was made between the actual and simulated LULC map of 2019 so as to validate the predicted map. The less effective simulated LULC class is water body as the projected map was from the maps before construction of the dam and the actual LULC map is from after the construction. The validation results between the simulated and actual LULC test summary of the model are presented in Table 
According to the authors of  | Future LULC Prediction: The LULC change of the future has been predicted for the years 2035 and 2050. The future probable percentages of changes in LULC for the periods of 2019-2035 and 2035-2050 were analyzed by transition probabilities matrix. The quantity of change and the spatial distribution are the two aspects of LULC prediction in LCM that are provided by Markov chain and MLP neural network, respectively

Significant change was observed from the change analysis result in LULC change between 1990 and 2050. Agricultural land will be the predominant LULC type. It was seen from the result as the area of agricultural land increment from 61.19% in 2019 to 72.98% in 2035 and 73.24% in 2050. This was mainly caused by converting forest, range, and some parts of grass land. Agricultural land increased significantly from 1990 to 2035 and then slowly from 2035 to 2050 (Figure 
Ref.  | Conclusions: The present study was carried out to understand the changes in the historical and predicted land use land cover patterns from the year 1990 to 2050. The integrated approach including remote sensing, GIS, and a MLPNN-based CA-MC model was used to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of LULC and prediction of future LULC change in Nashe watershed, Ethiopia. The conclusions drawn from the research findings were the following.
The multitemporal satellite imagery data are used for informed decision-making in LULC change, providing the potential information required for monitoring and evaluating of LULC changes. The precision of the data from the remotely sensed imagery classified based on the maximum likelihood classification method with high resolution image of Landsat was checked through an error matrix and it yielded an acceptable result that was further processed for analysis.
To validate the model, the projected 2019 LULC map was compared with 2019 actual LULC map. After successful model validation, the LULC map for the years 2035 and 2050 were simulated by considering the business-as-usual scenario. In this procedure, we used 1990-2005 and 2005-2019 LULC data as a baseline and current scenario for comparison. Its validation showed a strong correlation between the simulated LULC map and satellitederived map, which proved the simulation model's reliability.
The rapid and massive changes of LULC in the watershed may have serious environmental impacts. The analysis of LULC change shows that forest cover has been decreasing, as well as the high increasing rate of urban area and agricultural land. The predicted LULC situation show that this cover would continue in the future. This will increase vulnerability of the watershed to landslides, soil loss, gully erosion, worsened air pollution, and impact the hydrology of the studied watershed in particular and the Blue Nile Basin The forest land and range land show a decreasing trend from 2019 to 2035. Unfortunately, the grass land, range land, and agricultural land will slightly increase from 2035 to 2050. This might be due to the limited area of land for different purposes. The major contributing factors to LULC change were the expansion of hydropower and irrigation projects, mostly at the downstream, for expansion of a sugar factory. The scarcity of jobs and urban expansions in the catchment amplified the socio-economic activities for LULC changes. In the watershed, the downstream and partly at the upstream areas, which were previously covered by forests and range lands, have been converted to agricultural land and commercial crop farms.
Forest reduction also occurred as a result of using charcoal and firewood as the energy source for most of the people living around the watershed, who depend on fuel wood. Additionally, most of the evacuated population during the construction of Nashe and Amerti projects were involved in converting the forest land to agriculture and settlement. Illegal and unplanned settlements by the local people to expand agriculture and settlement also contributed to destruction of forest land, range land, and grass land. Thus, the forest conversion needs to be controlled and well-managed, and a reasonable land use plan should be developed in an organized way. The expansion of one LULC type occurs at the detriment of other LULC classes 
From the temporal patterns of the changes between 1990 and 2019, forest land decreased at a higher rate. The other affected LULC types were range land and grass land. The urban land and water body LULC classes gained trends in the study. Simulation analysis was conducted for the years of 2035 and 2050 based on historical LULC change data from 1990-2005, 2005-2019, and 1990-2019, which were used as a baseline. Similar to the historical analysis of LULC change, the predicted results of forest, grass, and range land classes were registered net loss in the area from 1990 to 2035. Whereas, the range land and grass land smoothly gained from 2035-2050. The predicted results of the year 2035 and 2050 show an increase in agriculture, water body and urban land. Therefore, future land use activities ought to be based on proper land use development and land regulation to reduce the enduring adverse impact of LULC changes. Ref.

The analysis of LULC change shows that forest cover has been decreasing, as well as the high increasing rate of urban area and agricultural land. The predicted LULC situation show that this cover would continue in the future. This will increase vulnerability of the watershed to landslides, soil loss, gully erosion, worsened air pollution, and impact the hydrology of the studied watershed in particular and the Blue Nile Basin in general.
Therefore, suitable and timely management measures must be taken by policy decision makers to enable sustainable development and to protect the watershed in order to reduce the severity of the changes.
Settlement expansion, agricultural expansion, firewood extraction, land tenure policy, and infrastructure development were the top LULC change drivers. Moreover, to ensure a better environmental condition, this kind of study revealed a significant prospective to contribute towards the sustainable environmental planning and management system of an area at the local and global levels.
Finally, it can be concluded that the projected conditions may be reversed, which is very important to reduce the enduring adverse impact of LULC changes on the watershed hydrological components through the announced nationwide tree planting, implementing the strategy of climate resilient green economy and formulating the local-and regional-scale policies required for sustainable development. Future studies incorporating the assessment of land use and land cover change impacts on the hydrological parameters of the watershed would be helpful for better management of the watershed.","Watershed Management in Action: Lessons Learned from FAO Field Projects; Food & Agriculture Organization (, 2017) || How dynamics and drivers of land use/land cover change impact elephant conservation and agricultural livelihood development in Rombo (, , , 2017) || Comparing two approaches to land use/cover change modeling and their implications for the assessment of biodiversity loss in a deciduous tropical forest (, , , 2012) || Evaluating drivers of land-use change and transition potential models in a complex landscape in Southern Mexico (, , , 2013) || Climate Change and Food Security: Risks and Responses; Food & Agriculture Organization (, 2015) || Land Use and Land Cover Mapping in Europe (, , 2014) || Land use change exacerbates tropical South American drought by sea surface temperature variability Land use change exacerbates tropical South American drought by sea surface temperature variability (, , , , 2011) || Tropical forests were the primary sources of new agricultural land in the 1980s and (, , , , , , , 1990) || Patterns, causes and consequences of land use / cover dynamics in the Gumara watershed of lake Tana basin (, , , 2016) || Evaluation and prediction of land use/land cover changes in the Andassa watershed (, , , , 2017) || National level land-use changes in functional urban areas in Poland, Slovakia, and Czechia (, , , 2021) || Landscape and urban planning landscape transformation processes in two large and two small cities in Egypt and Jordan over the last five decades using remote sensing data (, , , , 2020) || Changes in agricultural land use in the context of ongoing transformational processes in Slovakia (, , , , 2013) || Land-cover and land-use change in a Mediterranean landscape: A spatial analysis of driving forces integrating biophysical and human factors (, , , 2008) || Ecological planning for sustainable development with a green technology : GIS (, , , 2014) || Modelling and analyzing the watershed dynamics using Cellular Automata (CA)-Markov model-A geo-information based approach (, , , , , 2012) || Land use/land cover change modeling and the prediction of subsequent changes in ecosystem service values in a coastal area of China, the Su-Xi-Chang region (, , , , , 2017. 1204) || Land-use and land-cover scenarios and spatial modeling at the regional scale.

Assessment of variation of land use/land cover and its impact on land surface temperature of Asansol subdivision,Niladri Das; Prolay Mondal; Subhasish Sutradhar; Ranajit Ghosh,"Land use and land cover (LULC) Normalized difference build-up index (NDBI) Normalized difference water index (NDWI) Land surface temperature (LST) a b s t r a c t Economic development is a basic need for the growth of the region and it stimulates the rapid transformation of land use and land cover (LULC) units. Urbanization and industrialization are one of the major factors to increase temperature. Asansol sub-division is one of the important industrial and urbanized regions of eastern India. In this study, two different years viz. 1993 and 2018 have taken for the preparation of LULC and land surface temperature map. The kappa coefficient has been implied in this investigation to assess the accuracy of LULC maps. Temperature maps show that summer and winter surface temperature increases at the rate of 0.15 ¬∞C and 0.19 ¬∞C per year respectively. The result also reveals that temperature mainly increases due to the presence of urban, industrial and coal mine areas. The changing land use and land cover patterns show that the coal mine areas have been increased by 15% and urban areas also increased by 60%. Some correlations have been prepared to show the relationship between Land Surface Temperature (LST) and other spatial indices like NDBI, NDVI, and NDWI, where negative correlation prevails between LST and NDVI also with NDWI, but positive relation exists between LST and NDBI. Lastly, simulation of temperature for the year 2041 has been prepared, which shows that in the upcoming years' temperature may be increased up to 0.21 ¬∞C/year.","Introduction: For proper identification of a region, Land use and Land cover (LULC) is one of the most vital parameters for the proper identification of a region 
Several studies established that there is a strong influence of LULC on surface temperature and reported that the relative rise in LST depends on LULC change especially in the urban centers 
Remote Sensing and geospatial technology are some of the major modern tools for the identification of LULC and extraction of land surface temperature (LST) 
This paper attempt to identify the research objectives: (1) To detect the LULC changes over the last 23 years (2) To assess the Spatial as well as the temporal variation of surface temperature with the changing Land use. (3) To establish the correlation between LST and other spatial indices. | Materials and methods:  | Description of the test area: Asansol sub-division is lying on the Western part of the Asansol Durgapur Planning Area (ADPA). It occupies 836.80 Km 2 areas and had a population of 16.72 lakhs in 2011. The southern and northern part of the study area is bounded by Ajay and Damodar River.
The spatial extension of the study area is present between 23 O 41 00 30 00 N to 23 O 53 0 30 00 N and 86 O 47 0 41 00 E to 87 O 14 0 04 00 E (Fig. 
The test area is experienced by tropical monsoon climate with high temperatures in the summer and dry winter season. The average rainfall is 1408 mm. | Database and methods: LANDSAT TM (path/row: 139/44; spatial resolution 30 m) data of 1995 and LANDSAT 8 OLI (path/row: 139/44; spatial resolution 30 m) data have been acquired from USGS earth explorer. The   
2.2.1. Method for land use and land cover classification from Landsat (TM/OLI) imagery LULC map has been classified with the help of supervised classification using the maximum likelihood method of Image Classification tool in ArcGIS 10.5.
Band 1-5 and band-7 of Landsat-5 TM imagery have been considered for land use classification, but band 6 has been excluded as it denotes thermal band. Contrarily for Landsat-8 OLI imagery, bands 1-7 have been taken into consideration for land use classification. For the preparation of land use and land cover maps, all the bands have been stacked in ArcGIS 10.5 software using image analyst tool, then training sample manager tool has been used to identify the signature of the pixels, for this purpose large number of training samples have been collected randomly from the entire  imagery. The entire procedure for land use classification has been shown through the flow chart (Fig.  | Method of accuracy assessment of land use maps: In this study, accuracy assessment has been made through the confusion matrix or error matrix. This matrix explains the information about the actual and predicted identification of the pixel

But the extraction process of LST from Landsat TM and Landsat OLI is slightly different in terms to calculate spectral radiance (Lk). The procedures for the extraction of LST has been described in detail by many articles 
where BT = At-satellite brightness temperature Lk = TOA spectral radiance [vide equation ( 
Step-V Calculation ground surface temperature.   (1.438*10 √Ä2 m K), r ¬ºBoltzmann constant (1.38*10 √Ä23 J/K), h = Planck's constant (6.626*10 √Ä34 J s), c = velocity of light (2.998 √Ç 10 8 m/s) and e = emissivity (ranges between 0.97 and 0.99). | Methods for calculation of various spatial indices: Land Surface Temperature has been associated with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI).
NDVI is the difference between near-infrared and red reflectance which is the divisible sum of two and it describes vegetation phenology 
where  
where the green band is band 2 for Landsat TM imagery and band 3 for Landsat OLI imagery. Near-Infrared (NIR) band is band 4 for Landsat TM and band 5 for Landsat OLI.
Values of NDWI lie between √Ä1 to 1. In the case of water bodies, NDWI value is >0.5 and smaller values like negative values correspond to vegetation, so it is easy to distinguish water bodies from vegetation. The values range from 0 to 0.2 corresponds to the builtup features.
Remote sensed data help us to calculate the built-up index using the Middle infrared band (MIR) and near-infrared band (NIR). NDBI has been derived using the following equation 
where MIR is the middle infrared band (For Landsat TM it is band 5 and for Landsat OLI it is band 6) and NIR is the near-infrared band (For Landsat TM it is band 4 and for Landsat OLI it is band 5).
The values of NDBI also lies between √Ä1 to +1, where 0 to 1 correspond to built-up and value near 1 indicates a high density of built-up area  | Method to identify the association between LST and other spatial parameters: To understand the influence of the different spatial parameters on Surface Temperature, Pearson's Product Moment correlation has been applied. In this study, raster-raster (e.g. LST and NDVI; LST and NDWI and so on) correlation has been calculated in QGIS 3.8.1 software (Discussed in result and analysis section) using scatter plot tool.   | Method for change detection: Land use and land cover classification of 1995 and 2018 have been compared using the change matrix  | Method to estimate the predicted temperature: It is an important part of the study, where the future temperature has been predicted for the next 23 years through simulation. There are several methods to predict simulated temperature like Artificial Neural Networks, Markov chain, hybrid neural model, regression model, etc  | Result and discussion:  | Land use and land cover change analysis: The LULC maps have been categorized into eight classes viz. settlement, water bodies, coal mines, agricultural land, fallow land, industry, vegetation, and wasteland. In 1995 major coal mines area has been observed in the C2 grid (Figs. 
The accuracy assessment of LULC has also been analyzed with the help of the Kappa coefficient (Vide methodology; equation (4).
For the LULC of 1995, the value of Kappa was 0.81 and for 2018 the kappa value was 0.88 (Table 
Fig. 
At the micro-level, the climate has been changed with the changing of the LULC units. The rate of temperature change is very prominent at the impervious surface  | Impact of water bodies, vegetation and building area on land surface temperature: Other correlations have been studied between LST and water bodies, built-up areas and vegetation. All the maps have been prepared for the winter season as the winter season is cloud-free and low atmospheric haziness. Fig. 
Another important relationship has been observed between NDBI and NDWI. NDBI negatively influences NDWI (Fig. 
The last index that is NDBI or Normalized Difference Built-up Index has a keen impact on ground surface temperature. The relational value between them is 0.93 (Tables  | Predicted temperature for 2041: This section is an important part of the study where temperature of 2041 has been predicted with the help of artificial Neural Network model in Q.GIS (Vide methodology). The predicted temperature reveals that temperature will be increased at the place where coal mines, industries and urban area are present. With the increase of human demand, coal mines, industries as well as urban area will rapidly increased in the test region, so there will be huge chance of increasing temperature of the above mention landuse regions. Both figures viz. Figs.  | Conclusion: This study attempted to find out the fact that the increasing trend of temperature over the land area has been recorded both during summer and winter season. This research also explores that temperature remains above 42 ¬∞C at coal mines, industrial patches, and built-up areas. The changing trend of ground surface temperature depicts that maximum and minimum temperature during the summer season has been increased about 0.15 ¬∞C and    Moreover, the unused fallow land should be converted into vegetation land so that increasing surface temperature will be under control. In the urban areas, more vegetation should be planted and more parks should be constructed with dense vegetation like Chittaranjan. For the implementation of all these things, strict planning must be applied in this region. This may help to control further temperature increase.

Mapping the spatial heterogeneity of global land use and land cover from 2020 to 2100 at a 1 km resolution,Tianyuan Zhang; Changxiu Cheng; Xudong Wu,"A fine global future land use/land cover (LULC) is critical for demonstrating the geographic heterogeneity of earth system dynamics and human-earth interaction. In this study, we produced a 1 km global future LULC dataset that takes into account future climate and socio-economic changes as well as the impact of simulated results of the former year on temporally adjacent periods. By incorporating the variations in climatic and socio-economic factors, we differentiated LULC suitability probabilities for historical and future periods across representative SSP-RCP scenarios. then, by using an improved cellular automata model-PLUS to simulate the patch-level changes of various land classes, we iteratively downscaled water-basin-level LULC demands in various future scenarios to a spatial resolution of 1 km. Our dataset achieves a high degree of simulation accuracy (Kappa = 0.94, OA = 0.97, FoM = 0.10) and precisely captures the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of global LULC changes under the combined effects of climate change and socio-economic development. This robust and fine-scale LULC dataset provides valuable spatially-explicit information essential for earth system modeling and intricate dynamics between anthropogenic activities and the environment.","Background & Summary: Land use and land cover (LULC) change reflects the intricate interaction between climate change and intensive human activities 
Early LULC projections mostly forecast global land use demands at subregional levels, which are generally obtained from integrated assessment models (IAMs) such as AIM (Asia-Pacific integrated model), modular applied general equilibrium tool (MAGNET), Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment (IMAGE), and Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM). For instance, AIM simulates future regional land use dynamics by categorizing the world into 17 geopolitical regions 
Cellular automata (CA) have proved to be efficient in allocating land use to more spatially-explicit details, which are capable of defining the rules of cell-to-cell transformation as well as their adaptive behaviors and thus simulating the complex geospatial patterns. By integrating with land use demands generated from IAMs, CA models are capable of simulating scenario-based gridded LULC datasets with a finer resolution (normally 1 km). For instance, Li et al. 
Moreover, existing practices of future land use allocation generally utilize historical baseline to simulate land use dynamics under representative SSP-RCP scenarios, overlooking the effects of the simulated results of the former year on subsequent ones 
This study aims to produce a gridded dataset of global LULC at 1 km √ó 1 km resolution under typical SSP-RCP scenarios from 2020 to 2100 by combining the Patch-generating Land Use Simulation (PLUS) model and GCAM. Firstly, we use GCAM to simulate global land use demand at the water-basin level and calibrate urban land use generated from GCAM by means of a multivariate regression method. Compared to other IAM models such as IMAGE and AIM, GCAM has its advantages in simulating the spatial heterogeneity of global LULC with a classification of 235 regions at the water-basin level, by taking into account the discrepant land cover patterns in different agro-ecological zones and diversified socio-economic levels of different geopolitical regions. Secondly, by using the PLUS model to simulate the patch-level changes of various land classes driven by future suitability probabilities, we allocate the regional land use demand in various future scenarios to a spatial resolution of 1 km √ó 1 km. Finally, we compare the gridded dataset for future LULC with existing land use products to validate the accuracy of the results. This new dataset guarantees consistency across different SSP-RCP scenarios at explicit spatial details. Moreover, compared to other LULC products for future periods, this gridded dataset fully incorporates the impact of simulated results on temporally adjacent simulations and enhances the fidelity by using future suitability probabilities for land use projection. The outcome of this study can greatly help improve the accuracy of simulating earth system dynamics and modeling human-earth interaction. | Methods: Overall framework. Figure  | Projection of LULC demand.: GCAM is an open-source, multi-sector coordinated IAM developed by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), which gains wide applications in modeling agriculture and land use  | Downscaling of LULC demand on a water-basin scale. Spatially explicit LULC simulation models: provide a means to convey changes from macro to local scales 
The baseline LULC data, driving factor data, and restriction zone data used in the simulations are described as shown in Table  | Data Records: The dataset generated in this study is on a global scale with a resolution of 1 km and encompasses a timespan from 2020 to 2100, which is publicly available on https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.23542860 
We also calculated Pearson correlation coefficients to further assess the spatial conformity between the simulated results and historical LULC data in 2020, considering both overall and subtype-specific LULC distributions (refer to Table 
Moreover, Figure  | Suitability probability generated by driving factors for future periods.: In the simulation stage for future periods, we found that the LULC simulation derived from future suitability probability can effectively capture the influence of driving factors on LULC change. Using the forest in Southern Africa as a case, Figure 
Our analysis revealed that the future suitability probability has evolved from its historical counterpart due to the influence of future driving factors. Regions with lower suitability probabilities in the historical probability landscape (shown in blue in Figure 
We further examined the distribution of the driving factors that lead to the difference between historical and future suitability probability. Historically, the GDP level displayed noticeable national differences. Given Angola's higher historical economic level in comparison to Zambia (see Figure  | Variations in global LULC changes across different SSP-rCP scenarios. The discrepancy in LULC: under various SSP-RCP scenarios is well reflected in the dataset produced in this study. By taking Southeast Asia as an example, Figure 
To illustrate the variations in grassland areas across different future scenarios, we concentrate our focus on the Tibetan Plateau, a representative steppe region (see Figure 
Along with this environmental shift, intensive animal husbandry is forecasted to persist in this region, which is characterized by a growing population with an unabated demand for animal products and feed. This interplay of socio-economic and environmental factors contributes to relative stability in grassland area extent, forestalling any drastic reductions.
Comparison with other LULC datasets. We compared the gridded dataset generated in this study to LUH2 
Selecting regions with comprehensive LULC types in China (FoM = 0.12), Africa (FoM = 0.08), and the United States (FoM = 0.11) as examples, we validated the simulation accuracy by comparing our simulation results (see Figure 
Figure 
into 32 regions for the downscaling process, we divided the world into 235 regions at the water-basin level. This approach provides a better representation of the spatial heterogeneity in LULC simulations, and facilitates more precise control over the allocation of LULC demand within each water basin. Secondly, we adopted an iterative simulation technique starting with the historical data from 2020 as the basis for modeling the LULC of the subsequent future period, which was then used as the foundation for the simulation of the next period. This iterative approach considers the spatial impact of previous LULC results on the simulation of subsequent periods. By limiting the spatial and temporal scope of the simulation, we were able to control the number of pixels undergoing changes within each water basin. These abovementioned strategies help prevent the uncontrollable expansion of changing pixels within larger regions over extended simulation periods, and thus avoid the aggregation of changing pixels in areas with high suitability probability (refer to Figure  | Usage Notes: This study produced a global-scale LULC dataset that includes 6 LULC types with a 1 km resolution from 2020 to 2100 under different SSP-RCP scenarios. The dataset displays robust simulation accuracy across world regions at the water-basin level (FoM = 0.10, Kappa coefficient = 0.94, OA = 0.97), which can efficiently capture the differential impacts exerted by each SSP-RCP scenario on the future expansion of LULC. This LULC dataset is fully supportive for mapping the geospatial heterogeneity of future land use and can provide spatially-explicit data for simulating earth system dynamics and anthropogenic impacts on the environment.
Compared with existing global LULC datasets for future periods, our dataset gave full account to the variation in future suitability probability relative to its historical counterpart, and employed future driving factors to derive updated suitability probability for LULC expansion across different SSP-RCP scenarios. Moreover, we used the PLUS model, a CA model that is capable of modeling the expansion of multiple types of natural LULC Fig. 
Yet, this dataset still has some limitations. Compared with the natural LULC types, the correlation coefficient between the simulation results and the observed data for urban areas is relatively lower (see Table ","Spatiotemporal patterns and characteristics of land-use change in China during 2010-2015 (, 2018) || Land use/land cover change and the effects on ecosystem services in the Hengduan Mountain region (, , , , 2018) || Global land change from 1982 to 2016 (, 2018) || Measuring the sustainable development implications of climate change mitigation (, 2020) || The MAGNET model: Module description (, 2014) || Scenarios of land use and land cover change in the conterminous United States: Utilizing the special report on emission scenarios at ecoregional scales (, 2012) || Land use representation in a global CGE model for long-term simulation: CET vs. logit functions (, , , , 2014) || Harmonization of land-use scenarios for the period 1500-2100: 600 years of global gridded annual land-use transitions, wood harvest, and resulting secondary lands (, 2011) || Harmonization of global land use change and management for the period 850-2100 (LUH2) for CMIP6 (, 2020) || Global land use for 2015-2100 at 0.05¬∞ resolution under diverse socioeconomic and climate scenarios (, 2020) || Downscaling land use and land cover from the Global Change Assessment Model for coupling with Earth system models (, , , , , 2016) || Exploring SSP land-use dynamics using the IMAGE model: Regional and gridded scenarios of land-use change and land-based climate change mitigation (, 2018) || Gridded emissions and land-use data for 2005-2100 under diverse socioeconomic and climate mitigation scenarios (, , , , , 2018) || Global land-use allocation model linked to an integrated assessment model (, , , , , 2017) || A New Global Land-Use and Land-Cover Change Product at a 1-km Resolution for 2010 to 2100 Based on Human-Environment Interactions (, 2017) || Global projections of future urban land expansion under shared socioeconomic pathways (, 2020) || Future Land Use/Land Cover Change Has Nontrivial and Potentially Dominant Impact on Global Gross Primary Productivity (, 2022) || Global land projection based on plant functional types with a 1-km resolution under socio-climatic scenarios (, , , 2022) || Spatial Sequential Modeling and Predication of Global Land Use and Land Cover Changes by Integrating a Global Change Assessment Model and Cellular Automata (, 2019) || Cell-level coupling of a mechanistic model to cellular automata for improving land simulation (, , , 2023) || CMIP6 Earth System Models Project Greater Acceleration of Climate Zone Change Due To Stronger Warming (, , , , 2023) || Present and future K√∂ppen-Geiger climate classification maps at 1-km resolution (, 2018) || Evaluating the economic impact of water scarcity in a changing world (, 2021) || Global Energy and CO 2 to the Year 2050 (, , 1983) || Can updated climate pledges limit warming well below 2 ¬∞C?

LAND USE/LAND COVER CHANGE PREDICTION USING MULTI-TEMPORAL SATELLITE IMAGERY AND MULTI-LAYER PERCEPTRON MARKOV MODEL,H Nguyen; T Pham; M Doan; P Tran,"This paper aims to predict the trend of land use land cover (LULC) changes in Dak Nong province over time. Data from Landsat images captured in 2009, 2015, and 2018 was employed to analyze and predict the spatial distributions of LULC categories. The Random Forest (RF) was adopted to classify the images into ten different LULC classes. Besides, integration of Multi-Layer Perceptron Markov Neural Network (MLP-NN) with Markov Chain (MC) was applied to predict the future LULC changes in the region based on the change detection over the previous years. For all classified images, overall accuracy (OA) ranged from 77.35% to 84.55% with kappa (K) coefficient index ranging from 0.75 to 0.8. The results revealed that the annual population growth together with social-economic development was regarded as major drives for land conversion in the area. The predicted map showed a significant decrease trend in the forest classes by 2025, accounting for 23 thousand ha. However, residential areas, rubber, and agricultural land classes are predicted to rise to 460 ha, 3,000 ha, and 20,000 ha, respectively. The simulated model and calibrated area data may be a vital contribution to sustainable development efforts of the local based on the dynamics of LULC and future LULC change scenarios. Overall, ascertaining the complex interface related to changes in land use and its major drivers over time provides useful information predict to explore the future trend of LULC changes, establish alternative land-use schemes and serve as guidelines for urban planning policymakers.","INTRODUCTION: Changes in land use land cover (LULC) relevant to anthropogenic activities have significantly changed the biological and geochemical processes on earth contributing to global environmental concerns 
Remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) have been popularly adopted as essential and useful tools in obtaining accurate spatial data of LULC and quantifying the alternations of spatial data. The application of the CA-Markov model in predicting LULC changes has conveniences due to its powerful replication, and it is used for mapping LULC changes providing good performance regardless of dynamic modeling efficiently; high productivity with data, simple analysis; and capacity to detect transitions between land use classes

Dak Nong province has a high diversity of natural forest resources in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. In recent years, Dak Nong has experienced a burst in population growth resulting in high demand for agricultural land and urban expansion causing natural forest degradation. Besides, the technical guidelines in natural resource management mechanism have exposed issues such as deforestation, encroachment led to forest cover declined in the province  | MATERIALS AND METHODS:  | Study Area: Dak Nong province where is a part of the subtropical monsoon climate zone characterized by humid tropical highland climate and dry-hot southwest monsoon, located in the Central Highlands of Vietnam (Figure 
Figure  | Data Acquisition and Preparation: The research used USGS Landsat 5, Landsat 8 SR (Surface Reflectance Tier 1), and remote sensing data collections available on Google Earth Engine (GEE). These satellite images were captured by the years 2009, 2015, and 2018. Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 SR atmospherically corrected surface reflectance from the sensors of Landsat 5 ETM and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS, respectively. A resampling process of the thermal infrared (TIR) band was initially chosen at 120m/pixel resolution. Landsat 8 SR scenes contain four visible bands (B1, B2, B3, B4): orthorectifications of surface directional reflectance was applied to one near-infrared (VNIR: B5) and two short-wave infrared (SWIR: B6, B7) bands, while two thermal infrared (TIR: B10, B11) bands were processed to brightness temperature ortho-rectifications (Google Developers: Earth Engine Data Catalog). Landsat 5 SR data was corrected using LEDAPS (Department of the Interior U.S. Geological Survey. 2019a); LaSRC (Department of the Interior U.S. Geological Survey, 2019b) was used to correct Landsat 8 SR, and both included a mask for clouding and shadowing, through CFMASK 
As three periods were considered in this study, including 2010, 2015, and 2018, Landsat 5 and 8 SR data were used to ensure that the entire area was covered and the effects of clouds were eliminated. Accordingly, the Landsat image data sets were divided into four temporal periods including i) a collection of Landsat 5 SR scenes in  | Selection of Drivers: The driver variables are understood as factors that are the main contributors to LULC change  | Training and Validation Data: Within the study area, the ten different types of LULC were discriminated: (1) Evergreen broadleaved forest;
(2) Semievergreen forest (the forest that consists of a mixture of evergreen and deciduous dipterocarp tree species); (3) Dipterocarp forest;
(4) Plantation forest; (5) Mature rubber (‚â•3 years old) (6) Perennial industrial plants; (7) Cropland; (8) Residential area; (9) Water surface; and (10) other types of land (including grassland, shrubs, bare land, unplanned land, abandoned land, and so on).
Few studies have been published on the effectiveness of using collected samples from the integration of sources including the ground truth data, Landsat images with a high spatial resolution derived from Google Earth (GE), and reference maps 
The dataset used in the classification and validation process was collected from different sources such as i) ground truth points collected in the field; ii) fine resolution and very fine resolution images obtained from GE and iii) the existing Dak Nong Forest Inventory/LULC Maps. Besides, the sample areas were directly collected according to the given Landsat satellite images where the samples are discriminated against others based on the user's experience. | Methods:  | Image Classification:: The Random Forest (RF) algorithm proposed by  | LULC Change Detection Analysis:: Employing LCM acquires different temporal maps, and LULC maps of the year 2009, 2015, and 2018 were used to detect the changes of LULC classes. This allowed us to comprehend the transitional trend and contribution between LULC classes over time. | LULC Change Prediction:: The study used the integration of MLP with the MC to forecast the future LULCC in 2018 and 2025.
The MLP-MC model displayed in the LCM tool includes the following steps: a) change detection, b) transition model and c) change anticipation 
i. Change analysis: Two LULC maps were used to examine the primary transformations which are modeled independently as sub-model in the following stage.
ii. Modeling a transition probability: To clarify the driver variables, Cramer's V, a prominent quantitative measurement which indicates a number ranged from 0 to 1 implying how strongly relevant factors are associated with two categorical maps 
As performed in each sub-model of land transition, the MLP randomly develops a dataset of samples that have not shown the transition. Accordingly, each sub-model includes one transition and two samples of classes being provided. The MLP generates a neural network based on samples and driver variables corresponding with a connected network consisting of associated weights. The collected cells then are disjoined into two clusters including a sample set of 50 percent using for training and the remaining proportion for validation 
iii. LULC change prediction: The process of forecasting change is implemented in the LCM to examine the quantity of the future LULC in a given temporal period simulated by MC. The first output is a hard prediction model resulted from a projected LULC map according to the process of land allocation. A soft prediction is the second output in which a comprehensive vulnerability map is conducted corresponding with the set of transitions. Overall, the default values ranged from 0 to 1 are the outputs of the soft prediction 
To quantify the changes occurring on the future land use types, the MC simulation was modeled 
Therefore, the MC in LCM was employed to create a transition probability matrix for 2018 until 2025  | Model Validation:: The model validation process was implemented through an accurate comparison between predicted LULC maps and classified images in 2009, 2015, and 2018. The study employed the cross-tabulation in IDRISI regarding performance evaluation of the model to calculate OA from each predicted LULC category. Also, the K index was considered to measure the success of the simulation. Once the kappa index is acceptable, the LULC in 2025 will be predicted  | RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS:  | Accuracy Assessment: Overall, OA for all classified images from three temporal periods  | LULC Change Detection: This study compared three maps 
Human activities directly impact natural forests such as logging, agricultural expansion, or infrastructure, hydroelectricity and road development. However, the main driver of deforestation was the conversion of forests to commercial agriculture products such as coffee, pepper, rubber, cassava  | LULCC Prediction with CA-Markov and Validation: The  As illustrated above, the MLP-MC prediction model achieved a K value >0.80. K coefficients usually range from 0 to 1 
- The Disagree Grid cell and Disagree Quantity indices have significance in predicting the LULC changes 
Our findings indicated that the Disagree Grid cell = 0.1250 is greater than Disagree Quantity = 0.0098, this means that the precision for the correct prediction of the model is relatively high. Therefore, it is more likely to forecast the variations of LULC for quantifying than considering the location. Besides, the Kno index is regarded as the most important parameter which is used for evaluating the overall of a model 
The LULC map for the year 2025 presented in Figure 
It is recognizable that the decline in the natural forests may be due to population growth, the expansion of residential areas, and the demand for agricultural land increases. Moreover, the transition of a natural forest area into other land-use types such as grasslands, bare land, shrubs (3,000 ha) is also the reason for the decrease of forest area.
.   | LULC:  | CONCLUSIONS: Based on the LULC analysis obtained for the year 2009, 2015, and 2018 in Dak Nong, the classification results showed that the OA of LULC maps achieved from 77.35to 84.55% with kappa varying from 0.75 to 0.81. From this study, the findings revealed that the majority of land conversion in Dak Nong is natural forests to residential areas and agricultural land since the province experienced an increase in population as well as socialeconomic growth.
The simulation of LULCC in the year 2018 and 2025 using an integration of the MLP-MC resulted in high accuracy. The findings revealed that in 2018 the predicted LULC maps show reliable results with a significant agreement compared to the actual LULC maps. The simulation illustrates that the 2025 projected map indicates the trend observed from 2009 to 2018, revealing that the natural forest area will continue to decrease by more than 23 thousand ha. By contrast, rubber, residential area, and agricultural land are predicted to increase by approximately 460 ha, 3000 ha, and 20,000 ha, respectively. The findings from this study suggested that the observed continuous decrease in the natural forest area calls for concern which has caused pressures on the natural forest resources contributing to the high risk of global climate change. The modeled results also indicate that the current forest protection and management mechanisms did not very effectively work in the province. Therefore, findings may be useful and significant information for the local government to promote more effective policies regarding sustainable development and management of natural resources. -20,000-15,000-10,000 -5,000 0 5,000 10,000 15,000 20,000 ","Modeling urban land cover growth dynamics using multi-temporal satellite images.

A review on change detection method and accuracy assessment for land use land cover,Ali Chughtai; Habibullah Abbasi; Ismail Karas,"The assessment of land use land cover change is extremely important for understanding the relationship between humans and nature. The enormous changes at a regional scale and advancements in technology have encouraged researchers to gather more information. The remote sensing technology and GIS tools cooperatively have made it easier to monitor the changes in land use land cover (LULC) from past to present. This technology has unraveled the changes at the regional and global level and has also contributed tremendous benefits to the scientific community. A variety of change detection algorithms have been used in the history of remote sensing to detect changes at earth's surface and newer techniques are still in process. The data from remote sensing satellites are the primary sources that provide an opportunity to acquire information about LULC change in recent decades, which extensively use different algorithms according to the research needs. The selection of appropriate change detection method is highly recommended in every remote sensing project. This review paper begins with the traditional pre and post-classification change detection techniques related to LULC information at the regional level. Therefore, this paper evaluated the mostly used change detection method among all others to find remarkable results. Thus the review concludes the post-classification change detection method using maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) supervised classification is applicable in all cases. The comparative analysis was also performed in a selected region having multiple land features during review in which MLC results best in comparison to others. MLC is the most commonly used technique from the past till present that has achieved high accuracy in all regions comparatively to other techniques.","Introduction: In the course of the past three decades, remote sensing technology along with the use of GIS has provoked the importance of LULC change assessment due to more rapid and extensive changes made on earth's surface 
The main purpose of this paper is to review and focus the type of earth's surface regions in the context of LULC classes to define the suitable change detection method for extracting better LULC change information whether by implementing pre-classification change detection technique or post-classification comparison technique of individually classified multi-temporal multispectral medium resolution remotely sensed satellite data because it is freely and easily available such as Landsat mission in comparison of high-resolution satellite data such as SPOT, IKONOS, QUICK BIRD, etc., which is much more costly for academic and individual researchers. Due to the importance of monitoring change in earth's surface features, there is a gigantic need for scientific research for the evaluation of change detection techniques which is currently an active topic and new techniques are continuously developing. | A review of change detection techniques: In order to the selection of appropriate change detection methods, this review research has focused the evaluation of LULC features of different landscape regions to describe which change detection method is better to execute. Therefore in this section a diversity of change detection methods has been reviewed according to earth's land surface and has been categorized into eight different regions which are: 1) Vegetation, 2) Urbanization, 3) Delta Region, 4) Mountainous Region, 5) River Flow, 6) Coastal Zone, 7) Desertification, and 8) Watershed.
Most of the studies were trying to answer the reasons of what drives the changes in LULC of the region  | Vegetation: A variety of change detection methods has been reviewed in this category. This category includes forest areas, agricultural areas, and large-scale plantation schemes such as orchards.  | Urbanization: This category is based on the researches made upon cities and urban sprawl.
(K Ridd and Liu, 1998) compared four change detection algorithms in an urban environment of Salt Lake City metropolitan of Utah, United States. Image differencing, image regression, TCT, and CHI-square transformation were used to identify the best change detection method. The study was categorized into 7 categories which are: (1) Construction site to new residential (2) new residential to vegetated residential (3) Farmland to construction site (4) Farmland to industrial/commercial (5) Dry farm to green farm (6) Green farm to dry farm (7) Soil/Gravel tonal change. Among these 7 categories, this study concluded that none of the above mention algorithms has defined change in all 7 categories  | Delta region: The review of estuaries and delta regions has been discussed in this section.
(X.  | Mountainous region: The research study conducted on high and low steep mountainous and hilly region is reviewed here. 
Supervised classification MLC was used before the post-classification change detection technique to identify the type of land and the changes that occurred during the study period. The results showed a positive change in vegetation due to afforestation in the region and increasing trend in built-up, while a decrease in barren land and agriculture  | River flow: The researches made on rivers and flood affected areas has been reviewed in this category.
(Sharma et al., 2011) assessed pre and post-flooding LULC change of three districts of Gujrat state, India. Three different classification approaches iso-data, MLC, and fuzzy rule base were applied to extract LULC information. The post-classification change detection method was used to detect ""from-to"" quantitative change analysis during the study period. The Kappa statistics values of all three classifications were computed and compared. The comparison of kappa values showed that un-supervised classification ISO-DATA achieved 0.78, supervised classification MLC achieved 0.84, and the Fuzzy rule base classification achieved 0.87 because fuzzy rule classification gave better separation of LULC classes  | Coastal zone: The LULC assessment of coastline and seashore areas and its surroundings falls under this category.  | Desertification: The drought and dry land areas falls under this category are reviewed.  | Watershed: The researches on watershed are reviewed in this category.  | Analysis of literature review: In the previous section, eight different regions were reviewed along with a variety of change detection techniques applied. This section will evaluate the most commonly used change detection method applied to many of the research studies in the past two decades until the present. The post-classification change detection using MLC supervised classification has been implemented the most and proposed by (H. 
Few studies had also applied pre-classification change detection technique for a single land feature to detect the changes and extract useful information, for example, NDVI was implemented by 
The comparative analysis of change detection methods is adapted to justify the best method through thematic accuracy assessment results as  
Remotely sensed data always vary in spatial, radiometric, spectral, temporal resolutions and different types of sensors which may result errors in image classification, so the selection of appropriate change detection methods is very much necessary, as concluded in this literature that for a classified remotely sensed data whether supervised or unsupervised post-classification comparison technique is the best for change detection of a landscape with multiple LULC classes while a landscape with complex LULC features which cannot be easily evaluated using traditional pixel by pixel classification techniques require some advance classification techniques such as sub-pixel classification, decision rule-based classification and fuzzy classification for precise evaluation of LULC features. The extraction of single land feature to assess change and no change or rate of change using remotely sensed data depends upon the landscape features such as humidity, soil moisture, sun angle and spatial resolution which justify the selection of appropriate change detection method. | Selection of appropriate change detection method: In the field of remote sensing, analysis of the raster image for the selection of appropriate change detection method is important to extract useful LULC change information. The satellite image raw data may vary due to geometric and radiometric flaws because of the curved shape of    getting the best results (Figs. 
From the classification results, it is seen in Table  | Thematic accuracy assessment: Accuracy assessment methods are used to validate the LULC map classification processes which decide the quality of gathered information justifying that the image pixels are well classified or misclassified from remotely sensed data. These accuracy assessments can result qualitatively which is usually a comparison between classified LULC map and on ground situation or quantitatively to identify and quantify by comparing classified map data with reference data, which is very much important for developing results assessment and decision-making. A variety of accuracy assessment methods has been discussed in the previous remote sensing literature 
Error matrix not only calculates the user, producer and overall accuracy but also allows calculating the kappa statistics which is generated to evaluate the percentage of well classification has been performed. Kappa coefficient of agreement justifies the classification performed perfect agreement or just equal to random or no agreement. User, producer and overall accuracy assessment is basically a chance result in certain accuracy and to get rid of the influence of chance; kappa estimation can be done by calculating coefficient of agreement and mathematically represented as   | Table 4: Assessment of overall accuracy. | K% = 63%: Accuracy assessment of LULC change detection of remotely sensed data plays an important role in remote sensing and for the further information interested candidate should look at these two books  | Conclusion & recommendation: The multi-temporal satellite images of the same sensor are prerequisites for determining the change and selection of appropriate change detection algorithms to achieve good change results. The analysis for the selection of appropriate change detection is a dynamic research topic and newer techniques are still being developed. This paper has a detailed review of change detection methods applied on different study areas but none of the single change detection methods is applicable at all cases (A. 
Above all, it is very clear from the above pie diagram that there were numerous change detection methods used in the past two decades among those post-classification using MLC is widely used. In practice, several change detection techniques are often used to implement change detection, whose results are then compared to identify the best product through visual assessment or quantitative accurate assessment. The selection of a suitable change detection method requires careful consideration which has been discussed in section 4. The major finding of the present study is that all methods are not hundred percent accurate, but post-classification yields useful information and should be viewed as complementary in comparison to the others. Therefore it is suggested to research scholars, the scientific community, and resource managers to apply the mentioned approach for change method to get the remarkable results that will be helpful in high thematic accuracy and acceptable outcomes to prevent further losses.

"Tropical Coastal Land-Use and Land Cover Changes Impact on Ecosystem Service Value during Rapid Urbanization of Benin, West Africa",Damien Tiando; Shougeng Hu; Xin Fan; Muhammad Rashid; Leal Pacheco,"West African coastal areas including the Beninese coastal zones have undergone an intensification of socio-economic activity in the last few decades that has been strongly driven by the effects of rapid urbanization. This has led to land-use and land cover changes that represent threats to the sustainability of various ecosystem functions. Such dynamics of land use and land cover changes pose challenges to coastal zone management. Correct assessment is vital for policymakers and planners to ensure efficient and sustainable use of the coastal ecosystem services, and it remains crucial to achieving sustainable coastal zone management. This study examines changes in land-use and land cover (LULC) and their impacts on ecosystem services value (ESV) fluctuations in the tropical coastal region of Benin, West Africa. We employed Globe Land 30 image data for the years 2010 and 2020, and the ESV fluctuations during the study period were evaluated using the benefit transfer approach (BTA) with corresponding local coefficients values and the GIS techniques. The results reveal that (1) in the current urbanizing coastal area, the LULC types have changed significantly, with obvious reductions in forest land and waterbodies and a considerable increase in artificial surfaces;
(2) the total ESV decreased by 8.51% from USD 7.1557 million in 2010 to USD 6.5941 million in 2020;
(3) the intensity of LULC in the coastal region has increased over the last 10 years; (4) regions with high land-use intensity have a high rate of ESV change; and (5) provisioning services are the greatest contributors of ESV (51% in 2010; 41% in 2020), followed by supporting services (37% in 2010; 35% in 2020) and regulating services (25% in 2010; 30% in 2020). Uncontrolled changes in LULC from forest land and waterbodies are the main causes of the loss in total ESV, necessitating urgent measures to improve the coastal ecosystem sustainability through effective planning and policies.","Introduction: The concept of ecosystem services brings challenges in evaluating and balancing between sustainable socio-economic development and natural resources protection. Scientific assessment of the concept has concerned scholars around the world since the last decade, and it has recently been discussed in the context of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which call for synchronized international efforts towards a more resilient and rational use of ecosystem services 
The assessment of ecosystem services covers the loss or benefit costs of preserving a given amount or quality of an ecosystem service and is an integral part of the conservation decision-making process 
Coastal zones are the transitional areas between sea and land and are an important geographic zone both in terms of resources and human habitation 
Changes in LULC are among the main driving factors of ESV fluctuation 
Benin is a West African country located in the Northern hemisphere. It is bounded by Togo to the west, Burkina Faso and Niger to the north, Nigeria to the east, and Bight of Benin to the south. The coastal zones of Benin constitute important coastal ecosystems containing various coastal wetlands, mainly composed of mangroves, that are important for the maintenance of biodiversity and also for their role in sustainable socio-economic development  | Materials and Methods:  | Study Area: The coastal zone of Benin (Figure 
limited to several small coastal areas comprising a few districts of Benin  | Materials and Methods:  | Study Area: The coastal zone of Benin (Figure  | Satellite Imagery Data and Classification: In this study, the LULC data for 2010 and 2020 (Global Land 30 products with 30 m spatial resolution) were obtained from the China Environmental Disaster Reduction Satellite  | Statistics Analysis 2.3.1. Comprehensive Land-Use Dynamic: Land-use dynamic degree, also known as the land use change rate index, is mainly used to calculate the quantitative value of land use type change, and can also be used to estimate the land use change trend and the change speed in a few years. In this study, the land-use dynamic degree was introduced to quantify the variation of land use during our study period  | Land-Use Intensity Analysis: Land-use intensity indicates the degree of the interference of human activities on lands. The coastal zones of Benin are experiencing urbanization, with the intensification of human activities. The land-use intensity analysis expresses the comprehensive impacts of human activities on the variation in LULC during urbanization and the conversion of land for coastal development 
where I is the land-use intensity comprehensive index of the study area related to human activity, L i is the level or stages index of land-use intensity of LULC type i, and P i is the quantity of the LULC type. With reference to Cao, Li et al.  | Ecosystem Services Value Assessment: The present assessment of ESV in the tropical coastal region of Benin used a benefit transfer approach (BTA) based on the modified local value coefficients proposed by Kindu, Temesgen et al. 
where A k is the area of LULC type K, and VC K is the value coefficient (USD/ha/year). We also estimated the value provided by individual ecosystem functions within the study area using the following equation:
where A k is the area of LULC type K, and VC f is the value coefficient of the function f (USD/ha/year). | Coefficient of Sensitivity (CS): There are several limitations of the methodology of benefit transfers which we have adopted in this study. Different biomes were used as proxy for different land uses, although they may not match appropriately because there are so many uncertainties about the ESV of the different land use types. Due to these uncertainties of proxy values, a coefficient of sensitivity was analyzed using the standard economic concept of elasticity, i.e., the percentage change in the output for a given percentage change in an input. The coefficient of sensitivity (CS) or coefficient of elasticity (CE) is used to determine the sensitivity and robustness of coefficients in the analysis of ecosystem services 
With VC and A k , respectively, represent the value coefficient and the size of land-use type K, while ESV i represents the initial value of ESV. The higher the CS value, the more important the corresponding land-use type is to the total ESV. | Results:  | Variation in Land-Use and Land Cover from 2010 to 2020: The variation in each LULC type over our study period was analyzed via the superposition of the land data, and we generated spatial distribution maps in 2010 and 2020 (Figure 
and farmland covered 1.2%. In 2020, forest land occupied 68.3%, while artificial surfaces occupied 6.7%, and farmland 11.6%. The greatest reduction was recorded in forest land (10.2%), followed by grassland (2.1%). From the spatial distribution of Figure 
It can be seen that farmland and artificial surfaces have increased while the other land-use types decreased during our study period. The expansion of farmland (643.66 km 2 ) was mainly produced via conversion from forest (577.54 km 2 ) and shrubland (63.63 km 2 ). In the same time period artificial surfaces (336.21 km 2 ) expanded, mainly converted from farmland (12.23 km 2 ), forests (51.24 km 2 ), and shrubland (37.82 km 2 ).

The reductions in forest land and waterbodies are reflected in the fluctuations in total ESV. Our results cohere with those of previous efforts to quantify the ESV along the coastal zones of Tanzania by Ligatea et al.  | Sustainable Coastal Zones and Management and Policy Implications: West Africa's coastal areas, including the Beninese coastal region, face several challenges which put pressure on natural coastal resources and cause the degradation of ecosystem services. Increased human activity has resulted in LULC changes 
The valuation of ESV makes key scientific information available for use in decisionmaking related to coastal zones' management and the rational use of ecosystem services. Similar to the rest of West Africa's coastal areas, the coastal zone of Benin sustains various coastal ecosystems that are crucial for local populations' livelihoods and health, and which require proper management. Sustainable coastal zones and the rational use of coastal resources remain a priority of the local government. However, the total ESV during our study declined from USD 7.1557 million to USD 6.5941 million.
Current strategies face the challenge of the increasing degradation of the coastal ecosystem and the services it provides for local populations, livelihoods, and health. One of the main causes of the degradation of the coastal environment is the growth of the coastal population, which puts pressure on ecosystems and coastal environments. Additionally, the current policies and strategies lack the cooperation and enforcement needed to ensure the sustainable management of the coastal zones and the rational use of the ecosystems. In this context, we should construct effective policies to reduce the loss of ESV and sustain coastal zone management.
The first step is to promote local governance through collaboration between local authorities, institutions, and the population, and thus ensure appropriate decision-making related to coastal ecological environment protection and to provide additional socio-economic benefits to the value of these zones. We must also develop the design of spatial coastal zone management (ISCZM) to integrate LULC changes; coastal development and decisionmaking should consider ecosystem service losses to ensure that ecosystems are preserved. Further, we should promote the valuation of coastal ecosystem services by stakeholders in order to improve planning decisions and thus ensure successful policy implementation in environmental management and decision-making.
It is important to integrate socio-economic development and biophysical constraints into harmonized ICZM to ensure rational coastal land-use based on the indicators of the sustainable development goals (SDGs). | Limitations of the Study: Due to the limitations of the assessment methods and data availability, the results obtained in this study might include mistakes. One of the major limitations concerns constructing the model empirically with estimates based on the data collected from relevant studies, as this approach assumes the homogeneity of ecosystem service value across all LULC types  | Conclusions: The present study has analyzed the role of LULC changes in ESV fluctuations within the urbanized tropical coastal zones of Benin in West Africa. Land-use types changed significantly from 2010 to 2020 due to intensification of human activities, proved by the dramatic farmland expansion and increased artificial surfaces which have led to the large shrinkage of grazing land, shrubland and forests. From the above results, the following conclusions have been drawn:
(1) The total ESV during the study period was reduced from USD 7.1557 million in 2010 to USD 6.5941 million in 2020, a reduction of -8.51%. Under the current process of urbanization, the intensity of LULC changes has increased, especially in the eastern central coastal region of Cotonou metropolis and the industrial coastal region of Seme; (2) Significant changes in specific ecosystem function have been recorded, such as erosion control, climate regulation, biological control, nutrient cycling, soil formation, water supply, and waste treatment. However, provisioning services were the highest contributor to ESVs (51% in 2010; 41% in 2020), followed by supporting services (37% in 2010; 35% in 2020), and regulating services (25% in 2010; 30% in 2020); (3) Over the past 10 years, the regions with typically high ESVs have shown reduced ESVs, particularly in the coastal industrial zones of Seme. This recent dynamic of lost ESV in the coastal zones of Benin needs to be considered in order to improve the current strategies for the sustainable management of coastal zones, and to preserve the balance between development initiatives and ecosystem health. Given the ongoing coastal population pressure and the intensification of socioeconomic activities in the coastal zone, it is prospective that an increasing demand for land use will place heavy pressure on these ecosystems. Therefore, the capacity of coastal ecosystems to offer ecological functions and services to sustain the life of human beings will be further weakened. Therefore, it is important to regulate and balance population and socioeconomic activities in order to achieve efficient sustainable coastal management; not only must strict provision be made but also training for coastal land use under better monitoring and environmental precautions must be given priority as well as the most efficient technology in the conciliation of environment and economy; (4) The methodology of this study is economically feasible and has the potential to contribute to policy formulation for data poor areas. Further research in determining the value of the various coastal ecosystems such as coastal wetland could help remote sensing-based assessment of ecosystem value, and is expected to result in sustainable coastal resources management.","Earth observation in service of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development (, , , , , 2017) || Assessment of coastal ecosystem services for conservation strategies in south korea (, , , 2015. 0133856) || The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital (, , , , , , , , , , 1997) || Accounting for environmental assets (, 1992) || Progress of integrated ecosystem assessment: Concept, framework and challenges (, , , , , , 2015) || Impact of land use/cover change on ecosystem service values in the kilombero valley floodplain, southeastern tanzania.

Predicting changes in land use/land cover and seasonal land surface temperature using multi-temporal landsat images in the northwest region of Bangladesh,Abdulla -Al Kafy; Abdullah Al-Faisal; Abdullah Al Rakib; Sumita Roy; Jannatul Ferdousi; Vinay Raikwar; Marium Kona; S Abdullah; Al Fatin; H I G H L I G H T S,Configurations of LULC and seasonal LST change in the Northwest region of Bangladesh were analyzed. Built-up area expansion contributed to increased summer and winter LST by 0.55 C and 2.54 C per decade from 1999-2019. Temperature increases have resulted in a significant decline in agricultural productivity over the last 30 years. Summer and winter LST simulations indicate that more than 50 % and 13 % will likely be in >35 C by 2039. Prediction of LULC change and seasonal LST variation needs to be considered during urban development plans.,"Introduction: Urbanization is a challenge for any country. Developed countries face fewer daunting challenges than developing countries because of rapid and unplanned urbanization 
Bangladesh is facing rapid urbanization for the last three decades 
The application of Remote Sensing (RS) and the Geographic Information System (GIS) have provided opportunities to estimate LULC changes and the LST distribution in a particular region 
Located in the Northeastern region of Bangladesh, Rajshahi District is an agricultural-based region and well-connected with all over Bangladesh. In the last decade, industrial growth, availability of better educational institutions and job opportunities have attracted people to migrate to this region. The growing pressure of the population accelerates the unplanned expansion in this region. Methods comprising the use of the CA and ANN algorithms can demonstrate useful findings in studying the short and long-term consequences of the LULC and LST change in this region. It can also support decision-makers and urban planners in abating the UHI effect. The current study is a regional scale study and the first of its kind in Bangladesh's northwest region, to determine the past  | Study area profile: Rajshahi district located in the northwestern region of Bangladesh, between 24 12 0 to 24 42 0 N latitude and 88 15 0 to 88 50 0 E longitude (Figure 
Various monsoons define this region's climate, bringing moderate rainfall, high humidity and temperature. Seasons in the region are divided into four distinct groups: winter (with low rainfall, high temperatures, and high humidity) from October to February; summer (with minimal rainfall, high temperatures, and high humidity) from March to June; and monsoon (with heavy rainfall, moderate temperatures, and high humidity) from July to September 
However, despite the fact that the district is known as an agrarian region, industrialization reaches a high point in this region following the completion of the Jamuna Bridge in 1998  | Data & methodology:  | Data set and processing approach: The study was directed based on primary and secondary data. Primary data collected from field visits, Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), and Key Informants Interviews (KIIs). The secondary data comprise of multi-temporal Landsat 4-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite images obtained from US Geological Survey (USGS) website (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov)   | Impacts iof iLULC iChange: Observed iany ichange iin iland iUses iduring ithe ilast i20 iyears? i i i i i i i Yes No i i i i i i I i don't i know In iyour iopinion, iis ithe ichange isignificant iin iRajshahi iregion? i i i i i i i Yes i i i i i i No i i i i i i I i don't i know What iare ithe ichanges iin iland iuse iyou ihave inoticed iin ipast itwo iyears i(check iall ithe iapply)? i i i i i Decreasei ini agricultural i landi i i i i i Increase i of i roads i i i i i i Increase i of buildings i i i i i i iIncrease iof iindustries i i i i iIncrease iin iagricultural iland i i i i i i i No i change i in i infrastructures i i i i i i i Demolition i of i infrastructures In iyour iopinion, iwhat iwill ibe ithe iimpact iof ithis ichange iin iland iuse? i i i i iPositive i i i i iNegative i i i i i iI ihave ino iidea ground truth data for accuracy assessment of classified LULC maps. In addition, 10 FGDs (Table 
The questionnaires of FGDs and KIIs were demonstrated in Table 
Based on the output of the discussion, a sustainable future land use management plan was proposed for the study area. The KIIs and FGDs (8-10 participants) consisted of urban planners, agricultural officers, environmental engineers, policymakers, local community leaders, and decisionmakers. Information and opinions regarding the impacts of LULC change on seasonal LST, influences of seasonal LST variations on the agricultural sector and climate change, and preparation of proposed land use management plan were collected during the FGDs and KIIs. The outputs from FGDs and KIIs have been discussed in section 4.8 and 4.9. | Classification of LULC maps: Imagery from the Landsat satellite was classified into four broad LULC classes, including i) built-up area (industrial/residential/commercial area and transportation network); (b) agriculture land (green lands, agricultural lands, and vegetation); (c) water bodies (rivers, wetlands, reservoirs, canals, and streams; (d) bare land (fallow land, sand, playground, landfill sites, and vacant soil) for 1999, 2009, and 2019 using the SVM algorithm in ENVI 5.3 software. The SVM is a sophisticated supervised classification technique based on statistical learning theory which mostly results in accurate classification if the data are complex or noisy  | Validation of classified LULC maps: Around 40 samples were collected for each LULC class in order to produce the LULC maps. The accuracy of the classified maps was evaluated through 100 field level and 300 Google Earth image random sampling ground truth data. For accuracy assessment, the overall accuracy (equation  | Estimation of seasonal LST: The seasonal (summer and winter) LST was estimated using Landsat thermal band images from 1999, 2009, and 2019. Landsat sensors accumulate thermal data and Digital Numbers (DN). For the available data, these DN were converted to LST with four steps process illustrated in Figure 
The Landsat 8 has two thermal bands (band 10 and band 11) centred at 10.9 Œºm and 12 Œºm. Therefore, LST for Landsat 8 was estimated from both bands and then combined by using cell statistics to determine the final LST. | Variation of seasonal LST over LULC classes: For estimating the summer and winter season LST distribution over different LULC categories, ""zonal statistics tool as table"" under spatial analyst tools was used in ArcGIS 10.6 software. This tool summarizes LULC classes' values within the zones of the seasonal LST dataset and reports the results into a table. After adding zone layers (Figure  | Predicting LULC change for the years 2029 and 2039: The CA model was used to identify the future LULC changing pattern in the study region using QGIS's MOLUSCE plugin. During prediction, the CA model considers all the static and dynamic aspects of changes in every LULC category and provides an excellent accurate result  | Predicting LST change for years 2029 and 2039: The seasonal LST was predicted for the years 2029 and 2039 using the ANN algorithm in MATLAB software. The ANN is an effective approach that helps in time series prediction using previous year datasets 
For LST prediction, five layers (LULC images, NDBI, NDBSI, latitude, and longitude) were used as input supporting parameters, and LST images were used as output parameters. These supportive layers are essential as because they influence outcomes by allowing the network to manifest non-linear behavior. During this analysis, the initial learning rate (Œº) was set at 0.1, and the rate of decay (Œ≤) was used to monitor it. The standard rate of decay ranges between 0 and 1 (0 < Œ≤ < 1)  | Ethics: Consent was obtained from respondents prior to the FGDs and KIIs, and they remained anonymous. All contributors were informed of the study's specific objectives before beginning to complete the KIIs and FGDs questionnaire. Participants were only required to complete the questionnaire once, and they were free to stop it whenever they wanted. The relevant authority approved this study's ethical credentials (Rajshahi City Corporation, Rajshahi, Bangladesh). The privacy and confidentiality of the data were ensured. These KIIs and FGDs interviews were conducted according to established ethical guidelines of the concerned authority and the authors confirm that the respondents were informed of the study's specific objectives before beginning to answer the FGDs and KIIs questions. | Result and discussion: This section describes the results estimated from the methodology presented in section 3. The LULC changes, seasonal LST variations, distribution of LST over different LULC classes, prediction of future LULC and seasonal LST, and LST change impacts on agricultural productivity, and future sustainable land use management plan will be discussed in the following section 4. | Variation of past patterns of LULC (1999-2019): The trend of changes in LULC classes estimated from Landsat images using the SVM algorithm for the years 1999 (Figure 
In addition, to understand the extent of LULC changes, the area-wise distribution of LULC classes are presented in Table 
The data showed an unprecedented increase in the built-up area while a noticeable decrease in the amount of agricultural land and water bodies available for use. The primary reason for this is the rapid and unplanned urbanization that has taken place. Agriculture lands and water bodies were dynamically transformed into impervious infrastructures in order to meet the demands of a rapidly expanding population. Farmers are forced to cultivate their land more intensively as a result of the reduction in agricultural land, which increases the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, which contributes to pollution of the air, water, land, and other elements of the environment  | Changing pattern of seasonal LST: Thermal bands of Landsat images were used to estimate the seasonal (summer and winter) variation in LST distribution in the study region from 1999 to 2019. The illustration of summer and winter LST are shown in Figures 
The summer season's LSTs distribution in the study area is shown in Figure 
The Winter season's LST distribution in the study area is illustrated in Figure  | Validation of estimated seasonal LST: LST estimation using RS techniques requires weather-free and cloudfree images. The LST estimation of summer and winter seasons was performed using Landsat 4-5 TM and 8 OLI thermal bands for the years 1999, 2009 and 2019. Well-established equations were used to retrieve LST, however, it agonizes with certain limitations. Cloud coverage in an image can cause the values of LST analysis to be overestimated or underestimated. Additionally, none of the surface materials have a unique emissivity value in a particular area 
In order to validate the estimated LST summer and winter values from RS data, the maximum and minimum temperature data for 1999, 2009 and 2019 were collected from BMD (Tables 
The highest and lowest deviation was observed in the summer season for 1999's maximum and minimum temperatures: -3.27 C and 1.13 C. Besides, the deviated maximum and minimum values were -2.81 C and -0.2 C for 2009. For 2019, the maximum and minimum values were -0.52 C and 1.17 C, respectively. Overall, the summer season's average maximum and minimum deviations were -1.07 C, -1.505 C, and 0.325 C for 1999, 2009, and 2019, as shown in Table 
In the winter season, the highest and lowest deviations were also observed for 1999's maximum and minimum temperatures, which were √æ0.46 C and -0.7 C. Hence, these maximum and minimum deviated values were -8.15 C and -2.15 C for 2009. For 2019, the maximum and minimum values were -1.07 C and -6.69 C, respectively. Overall, the winter season's average deviation was -0.12 C, -5.15 C, and -3.88 C for 1999, 2009, and 2019, as shown in Table 
Taking all the limitations of RS-derived LST data into account, the small difference between estimated and recorded in LST can be accepted and used for further analysis, as well as the prediction of LST in the area of the study. | Variation of seasonal LST in different LULC class: Estimated mean seasonal LST distribution in different LULC classes were calculated using the zonal statistics tool in ArcGIS 10.6 software (Figure 
The variation of the winter season's mean LST in different LULC classes is also demonstrated a significant change (Figure 
The variation of seasonal mean LST over different LULC types provides better insights about the contribution of the built-up area in LST increase by replacing the agricultural and water bodies into hardscape areas. Rapid urban development, climate change, and global warming significantly contribute to the temperature rise. Massive infrastructural development increases the proportion of impervious and paved surfaces, which retained more energy and radiated more heat  | Prediction of future LULC scenarios: The CA algorithm was used to predict the LULC change for 2029 (Figure 
Comparing the predicted LULC scenarios (2029 and 2039) to the 2019 result, it was revealed that almost 58.03 km 2 (2.44 %) and 79.90 km 2 (3.35 %) of the study area will be turned into built-up areas in 2029 and 2039, respectively. Hence, a significant decrease in agricultural land (-1.50 % and -5.93 %) and water bodies (-0.47 % and -2.24 %) were also identified in 2029 and 2039, respectively. The highest positive net change was estimated in built-up (√æ1.16 % and √æ1.53 %) areas, where the largest negative change was identified in water bodies (-0.98 % and -7.40 %) for the year 2029 and 2039, respectively (Table 
Figures 
The increasing LST trend will affect the thermal capacity of LULC categories and contribute to the UHI effect  | Limitations of the CA and ANN models: While CA and ANN models provide an effective framework for evaluating and forecasting LULC and LST situations, the models are more accurate when the previous LULC and LST dynamics pattern remains consistent or stable. Therefore, the CA model is not always enough to make explicit spatial LULC predictions 
Regardless of their shortcomings, dynamic models effectively establish assumptions of land cover and surface temperature changes in any location. As a result, techniques such as LULC, LST change, and prediction mapping are rapidly gaining recognition as highly effective tools for managing critical natural resources and mitigating environmental consequences, particularly in the developing world. Significant LULC changes have occurred in the Rajshahi region during the past 20 years. The total area of agricultural lands was decreased by 8.27 % from 1999 to 2019, while the built-up area was increased by 7.81 %. From the FGDs and KIIs, it was found that the changes in LULC classes create substantial negative impacts on socio-economic and environmental aspects in the study area. Considering the socio-economic impacts, conversion of farmland or agricultural land to infrastructure development decreases the number of lands available for food production. Soil erosion, desertification, and other soil degradation associated with intensive agriculture productivity reduce land resource quality and hamper food productivity. Categories of LULC changes, especially the loss of natural resources (agricultural land and water bodies), create environmental effects by adding loss in biodiversity, destroy habitats that support biodiversity, increase greenhouse effects and surface temperature, disturbs the hydrological cycle and increase surface runoff, soil erosion, and flooding. During the FGDs, participants also mentioned that one of the primary causes of water pollution in the study region is runoff from agricultural land, which contains fertilizer used by farmers during agricultural production. The participants suggested an effective policy measure while preparing the land use management plan (discussed in 4.9) to control water pollution for the increment of food productivity in the future. | Impacts of temperature change: The study area is an agrarian-based region, and variations in seasonal temperature have significant negative and positive impacts on crop yields. Seasonal temperature change have increased the atmospheric CO 2 and frequency/intensity of extreme weather events. The participants from FGDs and KIIs stated that crop productivity due to the fertilization effect induced by an increase in the concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere, expansion of the available areas for growing the tropical and subtropical crops, development of two-crop farming due to an extended cultivation time and reduction of damage to winter crops by low temperatures are the main positive impacts of temperature rise. Besides, negative impacts of seasonal temperature rise include a decline in the number and quality of crops as a consequence of the low growth cycle for high-temperature rises, decrease in the sugar content and fruit store stability, poor coloring, rising weeds, and harmful insects in crops and decreasing soil productivity (Figure 
According to the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation, ""Boro rice"" production will significantly be decreased from 13.5 % to 2.6 % in upcoming years, with an increase of 2 C mean temperature in the study region. Due to the impact of climate change, Bangladesh is facing a 4 C temperature increase in the last decades, resulting 28 % and 68 % reduction in rice and wheat production  | Impacts of climate change: Climate change is causing organic changes in the study area, such as fertilization and breeding in the livestock sector as well as influencing the growing pattern of pastures. During the FGDs and KIIs, a significant relationship was established between the regional economy (mainly depends on agricultural products) and climate change in the study area mentioned in Figure  | Future sustainable land use management plan: Effective land management is a proactive strategy for mitigating the negative consequences of natural land cover change and unplanned regional development. Government officials and policymakers must conduct an extensive study of current conditions and trend analysis of LULC changes on both spatial and temporal scales in order to develop a sustainable land use management plan. Measuring effective land use management practices frequently necessitates an accurate understanding of current and historical trends in LULC change. The trend analysis of LULC changes would aid in conserving natural resources and mitigating the adverse effects of these transformation in the study region. The following issues should be considered when preparing a regional-level land use management plan, based on the discussion during FGDs. The issues are as follows: i. Ensuring the best possible use with restricting misuse and inappropriate use of bare land and water bodies. ii. Safeguarding the gradual decreasing trend of agricultural land with strict rules and regulations to feed up the growing population, increase economic enlargement, and conserve biodiversity. iii. Introducing and monitoring the zoning technique in order to make demarcation of natural resources (agricultural land and water bodies) according to rational criteria for effective utilization in various purposes. iv. Preventing water and soil pollution for ensuring better agricultural productivity and environmental friendly land utilization. v. Ensuring sustainable urban development by preparing a regional level master plan for planned and inclusive urbanization. vi. Increasing plantation, green cover, and established artificial leaks to mitigate the seasonal heat weaves. | Conclusion: This study's main focus is to estimate and predict the land use transformation and their impacts on seasonal surface temperature variations in the agricultural-based region Rajshahi, Bangladesh. The analysis revealed that the study region has been going through a significant loss in agricultural land and expecting more in upcoming years. This study also identified the impacts of land cover change, temperature increase, and climate change on the agricultural sector using FGDs and KIIs. Finally, based on experts' opinions and considering the consequences of unplanned infrastructural development, reduction in green cover, and climate change, this study proposed a sustainable land use management plan for Bangladesh's northwest region.
The LULC analysis demonstrates a significant increase in the built-up area with a net increase of √æ7.81 % from 1999 to 2019. Meanwhile, agricultural land and water bodies were decreased by -8.27 % and -4.75 % from 1999 to 2019. More than 29 % and 28 % of the total area were recorded in the temperature range of 32 C -< 35 C and 29 C -< 32 C in 2019 in winter season, which was 3.64 % and 0 % in year 1999, respectively. The seasonal LST distribution over different LULC classes revealed that the highest temperature was recorded in the built-up area while the lowest temperature was recorded in water bodies and agricultural land for the studied years. The prediction of LULC and LST changes indicates alarming results for 2029 and 2039. More than 23 % (2029) and 50 % (2039) of the total area will likely be experienced high temperatures in the summer season of greater than 35 C. For predicted winter LST, more than 3 % and 13 % of the area will likely be experienced in the high-temperature zone (! 35 C) for 2029 and 2039, respectively, which is comparatively high considering the winter season.
Based on this study's results and discussion, Rajshahi's local government and urban planners can consider unplanned and haphazard development in and out of the city area and formulation of increasing LST as a burning issue of this region. The inclusion of these study outputs in a regional level master/development plan will make Rajshahi District ecologically and environmentally sustainable and able to mitigate the possible impacts of climate change and global warming on agricultural productivity and food security in this region. The study also focuses on the importance of agricultural land, green cover, and natural resources and conservation approach by proposed land use management plan to minimize the UHI effect to reduce the climate change impact. Further research may focus on human-environment interactions to better understanding the causes and consequences associated with urban growth, LULC transformation, and LST change. Urban growth, changes in land cover, and surface temperature in other Bangladesh cities should be reviewed and predicted for future sustainable development. The results will improve the understanding of city planners and policymakers in making a district-level sustainable land use management and development plan for ensuring environmental sustainability at the regional level. | Declarations: for proofreading the manuscript.

"Impact of land use and land cover change on the environmental quality of a region: A case of Ernakulam district in Kerala, India",Sruthi Krishnan; Mohammed Firoz,"The increasing urbanisation trend over the decades has resulted in the rapid transformation of land use and land cover (LULC) patterns worldwide. One of the significant consequences of such an uncontrolled conversion process is on the environmental quality (EQ) of the regions, which needs to be addressed. Hence, the present study attempts to derive the environmental quality index (EQI) to measure the impact of LULC along a rapidly urbanising region. The study was divided into three phases. Firstly, the relevant variables were systematically identified from the literature and screened based on relevance, redundancy, context, and scale of the study. The variables then were finalised based on data availability and expert suggestions. The selected variables were grouped under biophysical, LULC, and socio-economic domains. Secondly, using remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques, LULC analysis was performed and the bio-physical variables were processed. The LULC maps (with five classes: water body, settlements, hill, forest, and agriculture) were prepared for the study region for 2000, 2009, and 2019 from Landsat images using a supervised classification algorithm. The LULC analysis showed an increase in the settlement over the past two decades. The relationship between the bio-physical indicators, namely, land surface temperature (LST), normalised difference vegetation index, and normalised difference built-up index (NDBI), was also established to examine the general perception that the increase in urbanisation is one of the main causes for the increase in LST of a region. The correlation indicated that the LST Impact of land use and land cover change on the environmental quality of a region: A case of Ernakulam district in Kerala, India 103","Introduction: Environmental quality (EQ) and the quality of life positively influence each other

Regional  | /RS110205: With the increase in sprawl and urbanisation in cities, LULC change detection has become the key objective of any urban planning study 
Variable selection, weighting, and aggregation are the essential and challenging elements of EQI construction 
In this study, we seek to address mainly three research questions: (1) With the increasing urbanisation rate in the region under study, has there been a considerable change in LULC over the past two decades? (2) Is the increase in urbanisation one of the reasons for the increase in LST. (3) Does the LULC change influence the EQ of a region? The first research question is addressed by conducting a LULC change analysis of the study region for the years 2000, 2009, and 2019. The second question is attempted to be answered by performing a correlation analysis of the LST with the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and NDBI of the study region for the three years. The final question is to evaluate the influence of LULC change on the EQ of a region by constructing an EQI involving the LULC classes, biophysical indicators, and socio-economic indicators. In the present study, the entropy method of weighting is used. Finally, EQI scores are represented in the form of a spatial map that can be used for making further interpretations and suggestions for improvement. | Materials and methods:  | Study region: The study region is Ernakulam, one of the districts
Ernakulam was taken as the case study region because of its highest decadal increase in urbanisation rate (68.07% according to the Census of India 2011 data) (Praveen-Sajini 2018). Kochi, which is the commercial, industrial, and financial capital of Kerala, is situated in this district and has the best connectivity through air routes, railways, and road networks, thus making it the most promising economically developed region. The effects of LULC transformations on the EQ was addressed by taking this case study, thereby rendering it truly representative for showcasing the impacts of urbanisation on the environment. The study region consists of 97 local bodies (LBs) 2 , which are the units of analysis in the present work.  | Variable selection: After the delineation/selection of the study area, the next step in the EQI construction (Figure 
Figure 
The first category, bio-physical variables, are most commonly used as proxy variables to indicate the importance of vegetation and the effect of built-up areas on EQ  | Collection of data: Primary and secondary data were used in the study. The primary data comprised satellite images downloaded from the Earth Explorer interface developed by the United States Geological Survey 
Table  | LULC analysis: The details of the LULC classification are critical for the various aspects of urban planning. For example, LULC information is required for land development, regular monitoring and evaluation of land use, environmental planning and management, construction activities, and landscape development. LULC change has a large impact on the environmental status of a region or an area. When a particular type of land cover is converted into another land use type, then its effects tend to be accumulative 
Studies over the past decades [e.g. 
For the analysis, the satellite images were first pre-processed for geo-referencing, atmospheric correction, and radiometric correction 
The pre-processed Landsat images were opened in ArcMap10.5 software for the LULC classification. The supervised classification method was employed to categorise the pixels into suitable LULC classes. Maximum likelihood classification was adopted by collecting more than 100 training samples/regions for each class. Signature files for each class were created. The satellite images were categorised into five different LULC classes, namely, water body, settlements, forest, hill, and agriculture  | Accuracy assessment: Accuracy of the classified LULC was assessed by using an error matrix and Kappa coefficient 
The accuracy parameters included overall accuracy, user's accuracy, producer's accuracy, and Kappa coefficient  | Extraction of LST, NDVI, and NDBI: For the extraction of LST, thermal bands 6 and 10 were used for Landsat 7 and Landsat 8, respectively. LST retrieval was carried out in ArcGIS 10.5. The process involved a series of steps 
(i) Conversion of DN to at-sensor spectral radiance The satellite image contains information in the form of DN. Hence, it was converted to at-sensor spectral radiance [equation (1)] using the spatial analysis tool in ArcGIS. L‚Ñ∑ = ML * Q cal + AL (1) where L‚Ñ∑ = spectral radiance at sensor's aperture (in W m -2 sr -1 ¬µm -1 ); ML = bandspecific multiplicative rescaling factor from Landsat metadata; AL = band-specific additive rescaling factor from Landsat metadata; and Q cal = Level 1 pixel value in DN.
(ii) Conversion of radiance into TOA brightness temperature In the second step of extraction, thermal calibration was carried out, which involved the conversion of spectral radiance to TOA brightness temperature using equation ( 
(2) where TB = TOA brightness temperature (‚ÑÉ); L‚Ñ∑ = spectral radiance at sensor's aperture (in W m -2 sr -1 ¬µm -1 ); and K 1 , K 2 = Thermal conversion constants for the bands.
(iii) Conversion of TOA brightness temperature into LST In the final step, the TOA brightness temperature was converted to LST using equations ( 
For Landsat 7, NDVI = float (Band 4 -Band 3) / float (Band 4 + Band 3) (6) For Landsat 8, NDVI = float (Band 5 -Band 4) / float (Band 5 + Band 4) (7) NDBI is an indicator to extract built-up pixels from satellite images. To extract NDBI from the Landsat images, shortwave infrared and near-infrared bands were used [equations ( 
For Landsat 7, NDBI = float (Band 5 -Band 4) / float (Band 5 + Band 4) (8) For Landsat 8, NDBI = float (Band 6 -Band 5) / float (Band 6+ Band 5) (9) | Relationship between NDVI and LST vs NDBI and LST: The variation of NDVI and NDBI with LST for all three years 
Adjusted R 2 values were also calculated to measure the proportion of the dependent variable (i.e. LST) explained by the independent variables (i.e. NDVI and NDBI) (Pal-Ziaul 2017). Adjusted R 2 value ranges between 0 and 1, with higher values representing a good fit of the model (Pal-Ziaul 2017). | Construction of EQI: Variable selection and data collection were explained previously. For the data matrix formation, the LULC classes and bio-physical variables (LST, NDVI, and NDBI) were processed from satellite images as explained previously. The data were collected for each observation unit of the study area. Data exploration was carried out and weighting the variables was performed using the entropy technique. The weighted variables were aggregated and an EQ score/index was obtained for each unit. Finally, the obtained scores were mapped spatially with the GIS techniques, and the EQI map for the study region was created. The detailed explanation of each stage of index construction is explained in the subsequent sections. | Initial data exploration: In the present study, after completion of the extraction and collection of data for all the selected variables, the data matrix was created with the units of observations on the rows and the variables on the columns  | Weighting and aggregation: After summarising the main characteristics of the dataset, the next step was to give weights to each variable. In this study, the objective method is selected for weighting. The entropy method of weighting, in which, the higher is the difference between the values of each variable, the higher is the preference given to the corresponding variable  | Sensitivity analysis: Sensitivity analysis is important in spatio-temporal models 
The output model may be affected by various error sources, and thus, the accuracy of the model can be checked by using this analysis

Stratified random sampling was adopted by selecting 250 random points on the ground (50 points per LULC class) using GPS survey (Figure 
Thermal bands of the Landsat images were employed for extracting LST, NDVI, and NDBI and were derived using red, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared bands, as explained previously. The spatial mapping of LST of the study region showed that the average temperature prevalent in the LBs had increased from 22.5‚ÑÉ in 2000 to 39‚ÑÉ in 2019 (Figure

Regional  | Discussion: The LULC change analysis was performed for the study region for the years 2000, 2009, and 2019. Five classes of LULC, namely water, settlements, forest, hill, and agriculture, were analysed. The results illustrated that till 2000, the percentage of area covered by settlements was very low. Later, with the increase in construction and developmental activities, such as industrial setups, service sectors, metro rail, and the opening of the container terminal, the settlement percentage increased. By contrast, the agricultural area has drastically declined over the decades primarily due to increasing population density, the shift in the occupational structure of the people from the primary sector to secondary and tertiary sectors 
The study further investigated some of the impacts of the LULC change in the study region by assessing the correlation between LST, NDVI, and NDBI. The results show that from 2000 to 2019, LST recorded a sharp increase in its Celsius values, mainly due to the increase in settlement patterns. The buildings and the development of other non-pervious surfaces have contributed to the rising temperature. At the same time, the NDVI and NDBI values showed a decreasing and increasing trend, respectively, for the same decadal change. The most evident reason for this change is the construction and development activities that occurred in the study region. Additionally, the correlation analysis confirmed that the LST increases with the increase in NDBI, whereas it decreases with the increase in NDVI 
The EQI spatial map of the study region showed that the identified poor and very poor EQ regions, which are distributed in the western part, have majority settlement characteristics, low NDVI, and high NDBI and LST values. Most of the industrial setups, ports, and container terminal are also situated here, which also contributes to the poor EQ of the region. The eastern part of the study region consists mainly of hills and forest areas, which primarily contribute to better EQ. The hills or natural resources restrict the construction or development activities, as evident from the research performed by  | Planning interventions: This study focused on the current impacts on the EQ of a region because of the increasing urbanisation trend by constructing an index. The analysis of LULC helps in the planning interventions at the city level. The present study can contribute to the knowledge of development control regulations, provision of better transportation corridors in the region, proper management of sprawl development, and diminution of urban heat island effect 
This study can also offer insight into the improvement in EQ and sustainability of coastal areas where these have been adversely impacted by the LULC changes  | Conclusions: This study investigated

"Annual emissions of carbon from land use, land-use change, and forestry from 1850 to 2020",Richard Houghton; Andrea Castanho,"Estimates of the annual emissions of carbon from land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) are important for constructing global, regional, and national carbon budgets, which in turn help predict future rates of climate change and define potential strategies for mitigation. Here, we update a long-term (1850-2020) series of annual national carbon emissions resulting from LULUCF (https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/U7GHRH, Houghton and Castanho, 2023), based largely, after 1960, on statistics of land use from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/, FAO, 2021). Those data suggest that rates of deforestation in the tropics (and thus net emissions of carbon) have decreased over the last 10 years (2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015)(2016)(2017)(2018)(2019)(2020). The data also indicate that the net loss of tropical forest area was greater than the net gain in agricultural lands, and we explore four alternative explanations for this apparent forest conversion, one of which is shifting cultivation. We also discuss how opposing trends in recent estimates of tropical deforestation (and emissions) might be reconciled. The calculated emissions of carbon attributable to LULUCF approximate the anthropogenic component of terrestrial carbon emissions, but limiting national carbon accounting to the anthropogenic component may also limit the potential for managing carbon on land.","Introduction: The annual net exchanges of carbon between land and atmosphere are represented by two terms in the global carbon budget: one term for direct anthropogenic effects (i.e., management) and a second term for natural effects and indirect anthropogenic effects (e.g., the response of terrestrial ecosystems to environmental change) 
One surrogate for the emissions of carbon attributable to management is based on land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) 
A second approach for estimating the emissions from LU-LUCF is the approach used by countries to define their national greenhouse gas inventories (NGHGIs) 
The analysis described here is based on the first of these approaches. We update and improve an earlier analysis of emissions attributable to LULUCF 
The update and improvements consist of four steps. First, we improved the bookkeeping model's simulation of fuelwood and industrial wood harvest. We then extended the period of analysis to 2020, based largely on national data on land use from  | Methods: Annual emissions of carbon from LULUCF were calculated with a bookkeeping model based on two types of data: activ-ity data (rates of wood harvest and rates of land-use change) (Sect. 2.2) and per hectare effects of land-use change and harvest on carbon stocks (Mg C ha -1 yr -1 ) (Sect. 2.3). | Bookkeeping model: We used a bookkeeping model 
The model is nonspatial. It uses national LULUCF data and calculates emissions for individual countries, but it does not use gridded data. Rather, the input data are annual rates of land-use change per country and cubic meters of wood harvested per country.
The overall purpose of the bookkeeping model is to track changes in carbon on every hectare of land affected by land use, land-use change, and forestry. Only lands experiencing LULUCF are included in the calculations. The effects of environmental change on lands either managed or unmanaged are excluded to the extent possible.
Each year a new age class of hectares is created in the model for each type of land use or land-use change in each type of ecosystem. Age classes either lose carbon annually (cropland newly converted from forest) or gain carbon annually (growing forest) until they reach a minimum soil carbon (croplands) or a maximum biomass carbon (mature forest) value (Fig. 
The changes in carbon stocks that take place as a result of land use and land-use change are prescribed in the model using response curves (Fig. 
Burning and decay of organic matter as a result of LU-LUCF accounted for annual gross emissions of carbon, while growing forests recovering from harvest or agricultural abandonment removed carbon from the atmosphere. The model simulated annual age classes until an age class reached a new equilibrium, at which point no further loss of carbon occurred (e.g., in cultivated land) or no further gain of carbon occurred (e.g., in a mature forest).
The bookkeeping model was developed to calculate only direct anthropogenic effects, ignoring the effects of environmental change on stocks of carbon. That is, rates of forest growth and rates of decay (Mg C ha -1 yr -1 ) varied for different types of land use and land-use change and for different ecosystem types (the model included 20 ecosystem types), but they did not vary through time. The same rates of growth and decay applied in 1850 and 2020. Thus, the model calculated emissions from LULUCF as though the environment was constant. The approach could not completely eliminate the effects of environmental change because field data used to define changes in vegetation and soil (Sect. 2.3) were collected at different times during the last 50 years or so and, thus, included indirect effects. For example, increased rates of growth as a result of CO 2 fertilization led the model to overestimate rates of forest growth in the past and to underestimate them in recent years.
Emissions of carbon from organic soils (burning and decay of peatlands as a result of management) were not explicitly included in the bookkeeping model, but they were added to the results based on independent studies 
We ran the model starting in 1700 but report emissions only after 1850 to avoid artificial emissions resulting from the model spin-up. For example, it took several decades for the pools of carbon in wood products and slash to reach equilibrium (inputs equal outputs). Similarly, it took approximately 150 years for the pools of carbon in age classes of growing forests to reach equilibrium. Rather than initializing the model with pool sizes and age classes specified in 1850, we spun up the model from 1700 so that these pools were in existence and approximately of the appropriate magnitude by 1850.
2.2 Changes in land use (rates of conversion, ha yr -1 , and rates of wood harvest, m 3 yr -1 )
We considered the four major types of land use that FAO-STAT (FAO, 2021) reports: croplands, permanent meadows and pastures (hereafter referred to as pastures), forest land, and ""other land"". The latter land-use type, other land, includes all lands that are neither agricultural nor forest land, such as urban lands, settlements, grasslands that were not grazed, rock, ice, and lands denuded by mining. The sum of areas in all four categories is equal to the total land area of a country, and other land is calculated as a residual to reach that total. We assumed that changes in these land uses from one year to the next are directly anthropogenic (i.e., a consequence of management decisions). Below, we discuss the possible exceptions to and implications of that general assumption.
We also considered forest management as a land use (i.e., the annual harvest of industrial wood and fuel wood; FAO, 2021). In the US, we included fire exclusion as an aspect of forest management that affects the carbon stocks of forests. Areas burned by wildfires were not obtained from the FAO but rather from the United States Department of 
We reconstructed historical changes in land use for each country starting with the most recent information and working backwards in time. From 1990 to 2020, we used data from FAO (2021) for national areas comprising forest land, croplands, pastures, and other land. From 1961 to 1990, we used the same data for croplands and pastures, but data on forest area were not available from that source. Before 1961 (for croplands and pastures) and before 1990 (for forests), we used national statistics or the literature, where available, to quantify areas under different types of land use regimes.
In the absence of such information, we extrapolated rates of change into the past in proportion to population growth. Thus, uncertainties in rates of LULUCF were greater before 1990 and greater still before 1961. Ironically, the variation among emissions estimates appears to be lower in the past compared with recent years, in part because rates of land-use change were lower in the past and in part because different studies presumably used similar assumptions in the absence of data 
Calculating rates of land-use change from FAOSTAT (FAO, 2021) data on land use was not a trivial exercise. We used changes in land area from one year to the next to determine rates of conversion among categories. For example, if forest area decreased by 1 ha and crop area increased by 1 ha, then we assigned 1 ha as converted from forest to crop. It is possible, however, that 2 ha was deforested and 1 ha was converted from crop to forest, thus yielding the same net change: 1 ha from forest to cropland. We underestimated the gross emissions and removals of carbon that would have resulted from gross changes in land use. The effect on net emissions is unclear, but some effect is likely as the emissions and removals associated with gross changes in land use are not necessarily symmetrical in time. For example, the rate of emissions from a hectare burned at the time of forest clearing is higher than the rate of carbon removal due to forest growth.
The relationship between annual changes in land-use categories (FAOSTAT; FAO, 2021) and rates of conversion between one category and another (land-use change) becomes more complex when net changes in area are reported for more than two categories. For example, if both forest and other land each decreased by 1 ha while cropland and pasture each increased by 1 ha, it was unclear how much forest area was converted to crop as opposed to pasture and how much other land was converted to either. Thus, we developed a series of rules to determine the translation of FAOSTAT data to annual rates of land-use change.
With these rules, a loss of forest was preferentially converted to cropland, then to pasture, and finally to other land to the extent that these categories increased in area. We explore the apparent conversion of forest to other land in more detail below 
The areas under cropland regimes are better documented through history than other land uses. Areas under permanent meadow and pasture regimes are less consistently defined, in large part because many lands that are grazed (rangelands) are neither meadows nor pastures.
With few exceptions (the USA, Europe, and South and Southeast Asia), national accounting of forest areas is not well documented historically. Thus, we generally reconstructed or extrapolated historical changes in forest areas backwards from the oldest available data into the past. Because the areas of different land uses are least well known for years before 1961, we adjusted the starting areas (1700) so as to end in 2020 with the areas of land use reported by FAOSTAT. | Changes in carbon per hectare as a result of LULUCF (response curves): The stocks of carbon in vegetation and soils of different types of natural ecosystems were initially compiled from ecological and forestry literature. These values were assigned to modeled ecosystems in 1700. 
The changes in carbon stocks that took place as a result of land use and land-use change were prescribed in the model for each type of ecosystem and each type of land use and land-use change (Fig. 
Similar response curves were used to define the rates of loss and accumulation of soil organic carbon following the cultivation of native soils and the abandonment of agriculture, respectively. Approximately 25 % of the organic carbon in the top meter of soil is lost with cultivation in a two-stage process approximating exponential decay 
In addition to changing the carbon in vegetation and soil, management also generates slash (branches, twigs, leaves, stumps, and roots left on site after harvest and forest conversion) and wood products. Slash was assigned exponential decay rates in the model that varied with ecosystem type, and wood products were assigned to pools that decayed at rates of 1, 0.1, or 0.01 yr -1 , corresponding roughly to fuelwood, paper and pulp, and lumber, respectively, which were obtained from FAOSTAT 
A set of four response curves defined the annual changes in carbon for each hectare cultivated, abandoned, or harvested. A different set of response curves was assigned for each type of land use and land-use change on each type of ecosystem. A total of 20 ecosystem types were included. | Updates included in this work: We incorporated the changes to 
-In step 1, we improved the calculation of carbon emissions from wood harvest, using data from FAOSTAT (FAO, 2015) 
-In step 2, we updated and revised input to accommodate new data from FAOSTAT (FAO, 2021); this step included some historical adjustments as well.
-In step 3, we treated the apparent conversion of forests to other land with four alternative assumptions. We also estimated the historical trajectory of this conversion before 1990 so that there was not an abrupt change when the FAO data on forest area first became available 
-In step 4, we included other effects of management (peat drainage and burning in Southeast Asia and peatland use in the Northern Hemisphere)
Each of these steps is elaborated below. | Adjustments to the bookkeeping model for wood harvest -step 1: Two adjustments were made to the original code used by 
the appropriate volume of wood products (from FAOSTAT; FAO, 2021) because some of the annual production had been assigned to slash. In the improved version, the total amount of wood products harvested was the amount specified by the FAO, and an additional amount of carbon was converted from biomass to slash.
The second adjustment reduced harvest intensity (Mg C ha -1 ) for secondary forests to account for the lower biomass in these forests. Thus, harvests were more representative of harvest practices. The improvement increased the areas of secondary forests harvested, thereby increasing the annual gross uptake of carbon in recovering forests. | Incorporation of new data from the FAO -step 2: We used two data sources from the FAO to update the analyses to 2020. Every 5 years since 1990, the FAO has published a Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA), with the latest being FRA 2020 
For a few countries, we used sources of data other than from the FAO. For example, we used cropland areas from Liu and Tian (2010) from 1961 to 1995 for China, after which we used data from the FAO. Appendix B shows the differences between the two sources of data. For Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, we used arable land from  | Alternative interpretations of forest conversion to other land -step 3: As discussed above (Sect. 2.2), FAOSTAT (FAO, 2021) has reported national areas under cropland, permanent meadow and pasture, and forest land regimes annually since 1990. However, the three classes of land use do not account for all land areas; therefore, a fourth class, other land, has been used by the FAO to account for other land uses and to ensure that the total area of all four classes sums to a country's total land area. Other land includes any lands that are not classified as cropland, permanent meadows and pasture, or forest. It can include un-grazed grasslands, shrublands, and deserts as well as anthropogenic lands, such as settlements and urban lands, lands affected by mining and energy extraction, and anything else that does not match the definitions of the first three categories. The problem with other land, from a carbon perspective, is that, without further information, its carbon density is unknown. This ambiguity creates a problem for carbon accounting when forests are converted to other land or when other land is converted to croplands. Actually, it is a potential problem even if the area of other land does not change. If shrublands were converted to urban areas, for example, the area reported to be in other land would not change, yet the carbon stocks would. We did not deal with this potential problem.
Here, we were particularly concerned with the observation that net losses of forest area exceeded net gains in agricultural area in many tropical countries. Forests were declining while other land was increasing. We explored the effects of four different interpretations of this apparent forest conversion to other land (FCO). Note that FCO is not a term reported in FAOSTAT (FAO, 2021); rather, it was inferred from the rules that we applied to the FAO data on land use to calculate annual rates of land-use change. This investigation of FCO became a major focus of this analysis.
The first interpretation of FCO was that the apparent loss of forest to other land was a statistical or accounting error. The data reported by countries are total areas of croplands, permanent meadows and pastures, forests, and other land. It is quite possible that areas were revised in one category without adjusting the others. There are two possibilities for error. The first likelihood is that the loss of forest might be overestimated and that, in reality, no forests were converted to other land. This error seems unlikely because FAOSTAT incorporates forest data from the latest FRA publication, which is systematically carried out and up to date. The second possibility is that the error might be in assigning deforestation to other land when, in reality, it was for agricultural land. For this interpretation, we implemented the reported deforestation rates but assigned deforestation to cropland rather than to other land.
However, what if FCO, or at least some fraction of it, represented a real change in land use? FCO has accounted for more tropical deforestation than agriculture, about 90 % of it after 2010 (Fig. 
We explored the effect of three alternative interpretations of FCO in addition to error. The rationale for considering that the reported change might be real was based not only on its relative magnitude (Fig. 
Thus, the first interpretation of FCO as real was that forests apparently converted to other land were converted to shifting cultivation. FAO (2021) does not recognize shifting cultivation in its classifications of land; rather, it is included in cropland. Here, we considered it a particular type of cropland. We have used the interpretation previously 
Traditional shifting cultivation is a special case for cropland. In this regime, the fallow period is longer than the period used for crops, and some tree cover persists. Typical fallow lengths are 2 to 25 years 
Our definition of shifting cultivation is broad and includes more than traditional shifting cultivation. It refers to the repeated use of forests for temporary agriculture. Shifting cultivation, or swidden, was the most prevalent type of agriculture in the tropics "". . . well into the second half of the 20th century"" 
For this shifting cultivation interpretation, we estimated areas and changes in areas as follows. First, we compared each country's area of other land in 1980 (based on our extrapola-tion of FAOSTAT data) with that country's area of forest fallow (shifting cultivation) in 1980 as reported by FAO/UNEP 
Annual increases (or decreases) in shifting cultivation were based on FCO between 1990 and 2020 and were estimated to remain a constant fraction of other land for prior years (1700 to 1980). A less uncertain reconstruction is difficult because the areas are not well known. A greater number of people might be supported by either a larger area under a shifting cultivation regime or a shortened length of fallow; however, neither of these variables is known for most regions 
For the second interpretation of FCO as real, we assumed that it represented the conversion of forests to new croplands, and, at the same time, the abandonment of an equivalent area of croplands to other land (in this case unproductive or degraded croplands). The abandoned croplands had low amounts of carbon in vegetation and soils, and they did not accumulate more after they were abandoned. In this interpretation, labeled degraded, there was a net loss of forest area, no change in cropland area, and an increase in other land. The increase in other land could just as well include mining or energy extraction activities as well as the degradation of croplands. Note that degraded cropland is not a term used by FAOSTAT (FAO, 2021); it is simply our label for identifying a possible interpretation of FCO, which we inferred from the FAO data (FAOSTAT; 
To summarize, the degraded, shifting cultivation, and recovering interpretations of FCO may be described as alternatives leading to high, medium, and low emissions, respectively, based on their long-term effects on biomass (Fig.  | The draining and burning of peatlands -step 4: Because our bookkeeping model did not calculate the changes in peatland soils from the use, draining, and burning of peat, we used published estimates to supplement the fluxes calculated here. In the tropics, we used the emissions from burning peatlands reported in version 4 of the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED4) 
We note that the FAO also reports national emissions of carbon from drained and burned peatlands  | Results: The four steps to revising the model and input data produced estimates of global emissions from LULUCF over the period from 1850 to 2015 that were surprisingly similar to the results reported 5 years ago (Fig.  | Adjustments to the bookkeeping model for wood harvest: Adjustments to the code to account for (1) the fraction of harvest that becomes slash instead of wood product and (2) the larger area required for secondary forests to provide the same volume of harvested wood as primary forests had offsetting effects; however, together, the adjustments led to lower emissions (Fig.  | Incorporation of new data from FAOSTAT (FAO, 2021): The ""new"" data from FAOSTAT (FAO, 2021) were largely land-use data for the last 5 years (2016-2020), but they included some revisions before 2016. Furthermore, we included revisions that we made to estimated areas of land use before 1990 in order to avoid abrupt transitions in rates of land-use change. Use of these new and revised data increased the cumulative net emissions little: from 112 to 116 Pg C for the period from 1850 to 2015 (Table  | Alternative interpretations of the conversion of forest to other land: As discussed above, the annual loss of forest area in many tropical countries exceeded the gain in agricultural lands and resulted in a gain in other land 
(2) shifting cultivation, including fallow; (3) degraded land; and (4) recovering forest.
The cumulative area in this FCO category was large. If all conversions of tropical forests to other land were assumed to be for shifting cultivation, the area was 450 √ó 10 6 ha in 2020, up from 239√ó10 6 ha in 1850 according to our assumptions. The highest rates of conversion to other land were in the 1990s (Fig. 
Because grown forests have the highest carbon densities in biomass, croplands have the lowest densities, and shifting cultivation is intermediate, emissions would be expected to be highest for the degraded interpretation, intermediate for shifting cultivation, and lowest for the recovering interpretation (Fig. 
The uncertainty in emissions is large, but the range is undoubtedly an overestimate because each interpretation is  treated as if it explained all of FCO. In reality, the true explanation for FCO is likely to include a mixture of these interpretations (and more). Furthermore, the uncertainty is higher than a more detailed analysis might find because expertise within the FAO would likely provide the appropriate explanation for FCO for any country and time. Those details were not used in this analysis. | The draining and burning of peatlands: Over the 170-year period from 1850 to 2020, the emissions from use of peatlands added 8 Pg C to emissions from countries in Southeast Asia and 29 Pg C to countries in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes (Fig.  | Overall results from the revised analysis: The results presented above sequentially addressed the four revisions to the model and input data. Below, we report the results of the complete update (all four steps included). Unless otherwise specified, the estimates given below refer to the shifting cultivation interpretation of FCO. | Net and gross emissions: Global net emissions of carbon from LULUCF increased from about 0.6 Pg C yr -1 in 1850 to about 1 Pg C yr -1 in the 1930s and never got much higher (except in 1997 as a result of unusually high emissions from peatlands in Southeast Asia) (Fig. 
The largest net emissions in the last 10 years (2011-2020) were from the three tropical regions (a mean of 0.500, 0.411, 0.308 Pg C yr -1 for South and Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America, respectively) (Table 
In the period from 2011 to 2020, global gross emissions (3.38 Pg C yr -1 ) were more than 3 times higher than net emissions (0.96 Pg C yr -1 ), while gross removals averaged 2.42 Pg C yr -1 (Fig. 
Gross emissions were predominantly (69 %) found in the three tropical regions (Latin America, tropical Africa, and South and Southeast Asia), while the gross sink was distributed nearly equally between tropical (46 %) and nontropical (54 %) regions. The higher net emissions from the tropics were attributable to the higher rates of deforestation there.
The offset of gross emissions and gross removals is not simultaneous and has implications for mitigation. Because most gross emissions happen rapidly, whereas most gross removals occur over a longer time, a reduction in shifting cultivation would result in a rapid reduction in (gross) emissions, whereas the (gross) removals (in regrowing forests) would continue for decades. Hence, gross fluxes are more indicative of the potential for mitigation than net fluxes. Furthermore, our estimates of gross fluxes are underestimated because rates of land-use change were based on net changes in area as reported by FAOSTAT. | Emissions by country: Over the last decade (2011-2020), according to the analysis based on the shifting cultivation interpretation of FCO, three countries (Indonesia, Brazil, and the Democratic Re- Net negative emissions are removals of carbon from the atmosphere (sinks). An explanation of the abbreviations used in the legend and a list of the countries in each region are given in Table  | Emissions by type of land use or land-use change: Land uses with the greatest emissions or removals of carbon varied among regions and over time (Fig.  | Emissions by carbon pool: The annual global net flux of 0.96 Pg C yr -1 to the atmosphere for the period from 2011 to 2020 was composed of gross emissions of 3.38 Pg C yr -1 from the burning of live vegetation, the decay of dead vegetation (slash), the oxidation of wood products, and the oxidation of soil carbon as a result of cultivation, including peatland emissions. Annual global gross removals were -2.42 Pg C yr -1 as a result of vegetation and soil recovering from wood harvest and agricultural abandonment (Table 
The annual transfers of carbon among pools for the period from 2011 to 2020 are shown in Fig. 
Wood products accumulated carbon over this decade (Fig. 
Forests accounted for nearly all emissions (99 %) for the decade from 2011 to 2020 if emissions from peatlands were excluded. It is unclear whether the emissions from peatlands in Northern Hemisphere regions were from forests or not. Emissions from peatlands (0.36 Pg C yr -1 ) were 37 % of the   total global net flux in this decade, while emissions from mineral soils were 22 % (0.22 Pg C yr -1 ). | Discussion: We limit the discussion below to three general topics. First, we explore the likely explanation for forest converted to other land (FCO). Second, we examine how these new estimates of emissions compare with other recent studies, including recent estimates of forest degradation. Finally, we discuss how we can reconcile reduced emissions of carbon from LU-LUCF in the tropics with increased rates of deforestation reported in the literature  | Forests converted to other land: Four interpretations were initially proposed to explain the apparent conversion of tropical forests to other land. ""Apparent"" is used here because the conversion is inferred from the areas of land reported by the FAO (2021) between 1990 and 2020. When the loss of forest area exceeded the gain in agricultural areas, the excess forest loss appeared as other land.
If FCO is an error in assigning newly deforested land to other land rather than to agricultural land, the emissions would be essentially the same as from the degradation interpretation. Both of them increase the area of cropland, rather than other land. The recovering interpretation is the least consistent with the FAO data, as it leads to a greater area of forest than reported by the FAO and is inconsistent with FRA 2020. Thus, either shifting cultivation or degradation seems more likely if FCO is a real change in land use.
According to the FAO, shifting cultivation is included in cropland. Thus, this poses the following question: are the areas assigned to croplands 
For Latin America, however, where the area calculated here as being under a shifting cultivation regime is nearly as large as the total area assigned to croplands, either our estimate for shifting cultivation is too large or the total cropland area is not large enough. Clearly, Latin America has large areas under croplands that are not under a shifting cultivation regime.
In any case, if shifting cultivation (and fallows) was included in croplands, we are left with the question of what changes in other land represent.
Based on these arguments, the most reasonable interpretations for FCO seem to be the conversion of forest either to shifting cultivation or to new agricultural land, mistakenly called other land or offset by the abandonment of old agricultural land that does not return to forest. By comparison, the recovering interpretation departs from FAOSTAT 
It is important to recognize that these interpretations include more than their labels suggest. For example, the degradation interpretation applies to more than the conversion of forest to croplands and the simultaneous abandonment of croplands. It includes the conversion of forest to any low-carbon ecosystems (e.g., urban lands, settlements, roads, mining and energy extraction operations). It also includes the emissions that would result from an error in classification if the deforestation had been for new agricultural land instead of other land. The shifting cultivation interpretation includes the conversion of forest to ecosystems of intermediate carbon stocks. The recovering interpretation represents temporary deforestation followed by forest recovery (Fig. 
Note that the more reasonable interpretations (shifting cultivation and degradation) are those with higher emissions. We use the shifting cultivation interpretation as our preferred estimate. It has the advantage of including shifting cultivation explicitly, although it is likely an overestimate. In the discussion below, we compare our estimates of area under shifting cultivation with other estimates. We also discuss the importance of shifting cultivation for gross emissions of carbon and, finally, whether shifting cultivation accounts for much of the uncertainty associated with emissions from forest degradation.
Trends in the area of shifting cultivation are uncertain 
We evaluated changes in shifting cultivation using an independent approach inferred from land-use data from FAO-STAT 
If we assume that FCO was driven entirely by the expansion of shifting cultivation and that fallows are counted as other land, then we calculate the total area under shifting cultivation to have been 277 √ó 10 6 ha in 1980 and 450 √ó 10 6 ha in 2020. These estimates are probably high because we assumed that all of the increase in other land was attributable to shifting cultivation rather than to other land uses in this calculation. For example, a recent analysis and review by 
Overall, the uncertainty remains, affecting both rates of land-use change and emissions of carbon. For example, in the last 10 years the degradation interpretation emitted about 0.260 Pg C yr -1 more than the recovery interpretation, a difference that was greater than the annual emissions from any country except Indonesia. The unknown fate of FCO lands (degraded, recovering, or shifting cultivation) contributed an uncertainty of about 13 % to global net emissions from LU-LUCF. If the emissions from peatlands are ignored, the uncertainty for FCO accounted for about 20 % of these global net emissions.
All of these interpretations make the implicit assumption that FCO is anthropogenic. Another possible interpretation for FCO is that the loss of forest to other land might not be directly anthropogenic but, instead, the result of increasing droughts, fires, or storms (see  | Gross emissions and removals: The greatest difference between shifting cultivation and the two other interpretations of tropical forest loss is the effect that they have on gross fluxes of carbon. Aside from wood harvest and agricultural abandonment, both of which include forest recovery, there are few other land uses that generate gross fluxes of carbon. Shifting cultivation accounted for 30 % of the global gross emissions of carbon over the period from 2011 to 2020 in our analysis. Gross emissions and removals for shifting cultivation alone were 1.02 and -0.72 Pg C yr -1 , respectively, in comparison with total gross emissions and removals of 3.38 and -2.42 Pg C yr -1 , respectively (Table  | Is shifting cultivation deforestation or forest degradation?: Carbon may be lost to the atmosphere through either deforestation (a change in the area of forests) or forest degradation (a reduction in forest carbon stocks without a change in forest area). Estimates of the carbon emitted from forest degradation vary widely, from nearly zero to greater than the emissions from deforestation 
In this analysis, the relative contributions of deforestation and degradation to the net carbon emissions from the tropics were 69 % and 5 %, respectively, for the period from 2011 to 2020 (Fig.  | How do these estimates of emissions compare with other recent studies?: Given that most of the data used in this analysis came from the FAO, one might expect the calculated emissions to agree with those reported by the FAO 
It is perhaps worth noting that the different methods used for computing emissions had little effect on the estimates (Table 
As noted earlier, the emissions calculated here were not very different (1850-2015) from those reported by 
(2017). Thus, although the results of the two studies are similar, those reported here are more comprehensive and up to date.
The net and gross emissions reported here are lower than the emissions calculated by BLUE 
Overall, the variation in estimates among bookkeeping models is small in comparison with other recent estimates of terrestrial carbon emissions 
Finally, we consider our estimates relative to two recent studies that have documented forest degradation  | Are emissions from LULUCF declining?: The recent decline in LULUCF emissions reported here (Fig.

The trends in rates of tropical deforestation and associated emissions are strikingly different between the  | Are the emissions from deforestation gross or net emissions?: When a hectare is deforested, net and gross emissions of carbon are identical. However, when FAOSTAT (FAO, 2021) reports a loss of forest area for a country, that loss is a net loss, and it is possible that high-resolution data from satellites record gross rates of forest loss that are partially offset by gross rates of forest gain within that country. In such a case, the emissions from gross losses in forest area would be greater than the emissions from net losses of forest area. It is possible that the higher estimates of deforestation (and emissions) from  | Deforestation versus forest loss: Another possible explanation for different rates of deforestation is related to the definition of deforestation. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UN-FCCC) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) define deforestation as the conversion of forest to another land use, i.e., cropland, pasture, or other land. The temporary loss of forests as a result of harvests, fire, or other disturbances, even if directly anthropogenic, is not deforestation according to this definition, as the disturbed forest is expected to recover. Moreover, the land is still defined as forest if it is temporarily without trees. Some estimates of deforestation, particularly those from satellite data (e.g.,  | Re-clearing of fallows already under shifting cultivation: A third possible explanation for different deforestation rates and associated emissions is that the re-clearing of fallows under shifting cultivation may be attributed to deforestation. The term deforestation is appropriate the first time a forest is  converted to shifting cultivation, but subsequent re-clearing of fallow is not deforestation (unless the recovery of forest in the fallows is identified as an increase in forest area).
The cropped areas of shifting cultivation have tree cover and may be mistakenly identified as forests with remote sensing. Older fallows are even more forest-like, although perhaps recognizable as degraded forest.
If only a small fraction of the re-clearing of fallows was counted as deforestation by 
Although any of these three explanations might help explain why satellite-based data would provide higher rates of forest loss than ground surveys, none of them explains why the disagreement between FAOSTAT (FAO, 2021) and  | 4.3.4: What if some deforestation is not directly anthropogenic? 
The broader issue is whether changes in land use and land cover are directly anthropogenic or not. We assumed that changes in land use reported by FAOSTAT were indeed directly anthropogenic. Clearly, croplands and pastures are (directly anthropogenic) land uses. Forestry is also anthropogenic, but forests and other land are not land uses, they are land covers; thus, if changes in other land result not only from changes in land use but also from indirect effects, FCO may not be anthropogenic, as assumed here. The distinction between directly and indirectly anthropogenic is important, as emissions from indirect effects offer clues regarding whether the terrestrial carbon sink may be changing. If landuse data from the FAO include indirect as well as direct effects, those data may no longer help define or constrain direct effects.
The distinction between direct and indirect effects has some similarities with the distinction between land use and land cover. Land use is clearly anthropogenic, whereas land cover may or may not be. Hence, the two commonly used acronyms to describe terrestrial carbon emissions -LULUCF (land use, land-use change, and forestry) and LULCC (land-use and land-cover change) -are not the same. LULUCF is a UNFCCC and IPCC term and concerns direct anthropogenic changes in land use. In contrast, LULCC, a term used by NASA and generally based on satellite data, concerns changes in land cover. The terms have been used interchangeably but perhaps ought not to be. LULUCF is generally assumed to be anthropogenic, whereas LULCC includes land-cover change, which need not be anthropogenic. If some deforestation is driven by changes in climate (e.g., droughts, fires, and storms), it should be attributed to indirect effects.
Indirect effects are believed responsible for a land sink that is larger than the net emissions from management 
Our use of data from FAOSTAT assumed that changes in land use/land cover were directly anthropogenic. On the contrary, changes in forest land and other land, in particular, could include both direct and indirect effects. Most scholars think that droughts, fires, and storms have so far been minor in replacing forests with other land cover. In other words, deforestation has been largely anthropogenic to date. The same is not true for forest degradation, which is driven by both direct and indirect effects. Separation of the emissions attributable to these effects is important, as mistaken attribution could mask a declining land sink. Indeed, declining emissions from LULUCF, given a generally constant airborne fraction, suggest that the land and/or ocean sinks are also declining 
Overall, one would expect satellite-based changes in land use to be more consistent (the same approach used everywhere) and, perhaps, more accurate (less potential for cheating) than changes reported to the FAO by individual countries using varied methods for determining change. Sadly, however, if the conditions described above account for the divergent trends in rates of deforestation and reported emissions, then data from satellites may not provide an easy resolution. The ""advantage"" of satellite data being more consistent may not be an advantage if, for example, shifting cultivation is not consistently practiced in different countries. Furthermore, anthropogenic versus non-anthropogenic disturbances are difficult to distinguish with any kind of measurement, and the fate of disturbed lands (including both land use and carbon density) may remain uncertain for years following a disturbance. The recent disagreement between satellite-based and ground-based rates of wood harvest in Europe provides an example of the limitations of satellite-based measures of land use 
On the other hand, forest degradation, as opposed to deforestation, may be better documented with satellite data than with tabular data, as it seems to be widespread and caused by a variety of different agents and processes 
One further advantage of satellite data (as opposed to tabular data) is their explicit geographic specificity. If the spatial resolution is fine enough, maps of changes in area can be overlaid on maps of biomass to determine the biomass of the forests actually deforested  | Conclusions: A major objective in quantifying the emissions of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems is to separate the emissions resulting from management (direct anthropogenic activities) from those resulting from the effects of environmental change (indirect effects). Those resulting from management can, in theory, be controlled, whereas those resulting from environmental change are more difficult to control. The estimated emissions of carbon from LULUCF calculated in this analysis approximate the emissions resulting from management, but they are not complete: they do not include the effects of agricultural management practices (e.g., irrigation), only the effects of converting lands from one use to another. They also include the major effects of forestry (i.e., wood harvest). Despite the difficulties and uncertainties apparent throughout this effort, quantifying the terrestrial emissions of carbon that are directly anthropogenic is important, both for predicting future rates of climate change and for identifying land-based solutions for mitigation.
However, the separation of emissions into those caused by direct, as opposed to indirect, effects of human activity may not be necessary for national reporting of emissions and, further, it may be limiting.

The main objective of this paper is to determine and analyze the changes in land cover and use, over time, on the biophysical parameters in the Caatinga biome in the semi-arid region of Brazil using remote sensing. Landsat-8 images were used, along with the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) in the Google Earth Engine platform, from 2013 to 2019, through spatiotemporal modeling of vegetation indices, i.e., leaf area index (LAI) and vegetation cover (V C ). Moreover, land surface temperature (LST) and actual evapotranspiration (ET a ) in Petrolina, the semi-arid region of Brazil, was used. The principal component analysis was used to select descriptive variables and multiple regression analysis to predict ET a . The results indicated significant effects of land use and land cover changes on energy balances over time. In 2013, 70.2% of the study area was composed of Caatinga, while the lowest percentages were identified in 2015 (67.8%) and 2017 (68.7%). Rainfall records in 2013 ranged from 270 to 480 mm, with values higher than 410 mm in 46.5% of the study area, concentrated in the northern part of the municipality. On the other hand, in 2017 the lowest annual rainfall values (from 200 to 340 mm) occurred. Low vegetation cover rate was observed by LAI and V C values, with a range of 0 to 25% vegetation cover in 52.3% of the area, which exposes the effects of the dry season on vegetation. The highest LST was mainly found in urban areas and/or exposed soil. In 2013, 40.5% of the region's area had LST between 48.0 and 52.0 ‚Ä¢ C, raising ET a rates (~4.7 mm day -1 ). Our model has shown good outcomes in terms of accuracy and concordance (coefficient of determination = 0.98, root mean square error = 0.498, and Lin's concordance correlation","Introduction: The Caatinga biome occupies a large portion of the Brazilian semi-arid region. It has a high ecological diversity of plant species, and it is considered the largest in the world under semi-arid conditions 
Caatinga is located in the world's most populated dry area, with more than 53 million inhabitants and a population density close to 34 inhabitants per km 2 . This biome has been affected by environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity over the last decades, mainly by the intensification of agriculture (e.g., rainfed and irrigated crops cultivation), urban expansion, and the advance of pasture areas replacing the natural vegetation 
Therefore, monitoring physical-water indicators of environmental change conditions, such as the loss of biodiversity of biomes and land use and occupation, is vital in managing scarce water resources. Furthermore, these indicators may be helpful in the planning of agricultural activities, as well as in the management of dry areas and the sustainable use and management of natural resources 
In this scenario, remote sensing has been used as a tool that presents fast and low operational costs, being efficient in calculating the biophysical parameters used in the energy, water, and vegetation balances (e.g., 
In this context, there are several surface energy balance models, such as Mapping EvapoTranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC), Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS), Simple Algorithm for Evapotranspiration Retrieving (SAFER), Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse (Alexi), and the Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL), based on remote sensing data. The approach is substantiated on biophysical parameters, such as LST, albedo, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and emissivity, that are crucial for estimating ET 
Based on the above, the main objective of this paper is to determine and analyze the changes in land cover, land use, and occupation on biophysical parameters in the Caatinga biome in the semi-arid region of Brazil. In the present study, the changes were assessed from 2013 to 2019 using Landsat imagery, and biophysical parameters (net radiation, energy balance, LAI, V C , ET a , and LST) were estimated by utilizing remote sensing. Additionally, the SEBAL model was applied to determine the surface energy balance in different vegetation environments. After applying the model, the dataset provided by SEBAL allowed us to determine the turbulent fluxes and actual evapotranspiration (ET a ) of the different land use and land cover (LULC) types. Thus, through the SEBAL products, the spatiotemporal variation patterns of ET a in agricultural and forestry areas were evaluated. | Materials and Methods:  | Study Area: The study was carried out in the municipality of Petrolina, located in the State of Pernambuco, Brazil. The region comprises the domain of the Caatinga biome and it belongs to the semi-arid region of the sub-mean of the S√£o Francisco Valley. The town is considered the largest fruit-growing center of the Brazilian semi-arid region due to the easy access to the S√£o Francisco river, which supplies the irrigated perimeters. The municipality comprises a territorial area of 4561.870 km 2 (Figure 
A characteristic of the Caatinga biome is the presence of different floristic mosaics, consisting of an area of tree and shrub vegetation, which presents its distribution conditioned to climatic and environmental variations, especially rainfall intensity and frequency  | Satellite Images and Weather Datasets: Annual records of average air temperature ( ‚Ä¢ C), global radiation (MJ m -2 ), relative humidity (%), atmospheric pressure (kPa), wind speed (m s -1 ), and rainfall (mm) were obtained from the database of the National Institute of Meteorology 
The years 2013 (334.4 mm) and 2019 (221.6 mm) showed the highest rainfall rates. Most of the rainfall recorded for Petrolina was concentrated from December to March (Figure 
Rainfall data corresponding to the 30 days prior to the four imaging dates studied used were obtained from the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS). CHIRPS are new precipitation products covering the coordinates 50 ‚Ä¢ S-50 ‚Ä¢ N and 180 ‚Ä¢ E-180 ‚Ä¢ W, with 0.05 ‚Ä¢ (¬±5.3 km) spatial resolution and daily to seasonal, temporal resolutions, available worldwide since 1981  | Vegetation Indices: The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated to represent the amount and quality of vegetation present on the surface, characterized as an indicator of wet conditions, calculated using Equation (1).
where œÅ NIR and œÅ Red are the reflectances measured in the near-infrared and red bands (i.e., Landsat-8 multispectral bands 5 and 4 of the OLI sensor), respectively, they range from -1 to +1. Values close to 1 on a positive scale correspond to high photosynthetic activity, and when negative, generally correspond to water bodies.
Based on the NDVI, we calculated the vegetation cover (V C ) of the study area (Equation ( 
where V C is the vegetation cover, NDVI S is the minimum NDVI value from bare soil pixels obtained in the study area, and NDVI V is the maximum NDVI value found in vegetated areas, i.e., from fully vegetated pixels. The NDVI S and NDVI V used to calculate V C were obtained from the domain of each NDVI image percentile map obtained from the NDVI histograms. Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) was calculated to observe the vegetation cover of the area (Equation ( 
where L is the adjustment factor to the soil, which varies between 0 and 1. The value 0 does not reach change, and resembles the NDVI. In areas with low-density vegetation, the value 1 is assigned; for intermediate-density vegetation areas, the value of 0.5; and for areas with high-density vegetation, the value 0.25 is assigned 
To evaluate changes in vegetation biomass, the leaf area index (LAI, m 2 m -2 ) was determined (Equation (  | Methodology for Estimating Evapotranspiration Using Satellite Images: Evapotranspiration was estimated using the Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL). For this, routine meteorological data and spectral bands from the Landsat-8 satellite were used. The SEBAL algorithm was implemented using JavaScript code through the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The data were exported in spreadsheet format (*.xls). SEBAL uses mathematical modeling and operations to calculate the surface energy balance components and determine evapotranspiration. Thus, energy balance components are computed pixel-by-pixel, as described in Figure  | Surface Albedo Adjustment: The surface albedo (Œ± sup ) corresponds to a measure of the reflectivity of the Earth's surface, for each pixel, with atmospheric correction obtained according to Equation 
where Œ± toa is the albedo at the top of the atmosphere, that is, before atmospheric correction, Œ± path is the atmospheric reflectance (set to 0.03, as used by Silva et al. 
where P a is the atmospheric pressure (kPa), with dataset available freely in https://portal. inmet.gov.br/ (accessed on 10 August 2021), K t is the turbidity coefficient of the atmosphere (K t = 1.0, for a clear sky day), according to Allen et al. 
where e a is the actual atmospheric water vapor pressure (kPa), estimated from Equation ( 
where HR is the instantaneous relative humidity (%), and e s is the water vapor saturation pressure (kPa), estimated from Equation ( 
where T 0 is the instantaneous air temperature ( ‚Ä¢ C) at the moment of the satellite pass.
For obtaining Œ± toa , a linear combination of the spectral reflectance of the six reflective OLI bands was performed according to Equation 
where the terms Add b and Mult b belong to the radiometric rescaling group, specifically reflectance_add_band (equal to -0.1) and reflectance_mult_band (equal to 0.00002), respectively, presented in the metadata of each OLI-Landsat-8 image, DN is the digital number value corresponding to the pixel, Œ∏ is the solar zenith angle at the data acquisition time, and dr is the Earth-Sun distance in astronomical units. | Determination of Surface-energy Partitioning: Based on the surface energy balance components, the evaporative fraction was determined. Initially, the surface radiation balance or net radiation-R n was calculated, which is distributed by the energy partitioning in front of the sensible heat fluxes-H, latent-LE, and soil heat flux-G 
The land surface temperature (LST) in K (Kelvin) was obtained using the spectral radiance in band 10 of the TIRS sensor and the emissivity in the nearest band-Œµ nb by the modified Planck's Law 
where K 1 and K 2 are radiation constants specific for the Landsat-8 TIRS band 10, equaling 774.89 W m -2 sr -1 ¬µm -1 and 1321.08 K, respectively, provided by NASA/USGS; and L 10 is the radiance at the wavelength received by the sensors (band 10, the thermal band). The Œµ nb was calculated based on the LAI for each pixel according to Equation (13) 
Initially, the temperature variation and aerodynamic resistance to heat transport in all pixels of the study area (Petrolina, Pernambuco) were determined. The atmosphere was initially assumed to be in a neutral stability condition. For this study, the hot pixel was considered in the exposed soil plots (i.e., no vegetation cover and/or little vegetation and low moisture content), assuming LE equal to zero. The cold pixel was considered in grape orchard plots irrigated by micro-sprinklers, when H can be considered zero  | Calculation of Energy Fluxes (H and LE) and Evaporative Fraction: The sensible heat flux (H) in SEBAL is calculated using an iterative procedure from the aerodynamic function (Equation ( 
where œÅ air is the moist air density (kg m -3 ), C p is the air specific heat at constant pressure (1004 J kg -1 K -1 ), a and b are calibration constants of the temperature difference between two heights (i.e., between the roughness length for heat transfer and the reference height, usually 0.1 and 2.0 m above the displacement plane), and r ah is the near-surface aerodynamic resistance to heat transport (s m -1 ). Fundamentally, the coefficients a and b are determined through an internal calibration for each satellite image by interactive processes. We consider extreme pixels of wet/cold and dry/hot spots. They were selected to develop a linear relationship between the aerodynamic temperature of the surface and the air temperature difference, and the LST. By knowing the components of the surface energy balance, such as the net radiation (R n , W m -2 ), sensible heat flux (H, W m -2 ), and soil heat flux (G, W m -2 ), the latent heat flux (LE, W m -2 ) was determined, both corresponding to the time of the satellite pass over the study area, according to Equation 
Subsequently, we determined the evaporative fraction (Œõ) according to Equation  | Estimate of ET a Using SEBAL Method: Finally, as a SEBAL product, we determine the actual evapotranspiration (ET a , mm day -1 ) 
where R n24 is the daily net radiation (W m -2 ), 86,400 is a constant for daily timescale conversion (i.e., converts from seconds to days), and Œª is the latent heat of vaporization of water (J kg -1 ). Then, the latent heat of vaporization allows the ET a expression in mm day -1 . Hence, accurate estimation of R n24 (Equation ( 
where a is a regression coefficient of the relationship between net longwave radiation and atmospheric transmissivity on a daily scale, to which we assigned the value 143, as proposed by Teixeira et al.  | Land Use and Land Cover Dynamics: In the present study, we sought to evaluate the impacts of changes in land use and land cover (LULC) under the biophysical variables in the municipality of Petrolina. Thus, we performed the extraction of descriptive statistical parameters (i.e., minimum, maximum, mean, median, and standard deviation) for the variables LAI, V C , ET a , LE, H, LST, emissivity, and R n in each class of LULC, from the maps available on the MapBiomas Brazil platform 
(1) arboreal Caatinga, (2) shrub Caatinga, (3) herbaceous Caatinga, (4) pasture, (5) agriculture, (6) mosaic of agriculture and pasture, (7) urban area, and (8) water bodies with a spatial resolution of 30 meters 
The MapBiomas classification is a hierarchical system combining land use and land cover. This classification is based on a pixel-by-pixel classification of Landsat images, where we use the machine learning algorithm random forest. Thus, the LULC classes for 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2019 were converted from raster files to vector files. We use the ""polygonise"" tool, which transforms classes into polygons with the help of QGIS 3.16 software  | Statistical Analyses: In this study, we applied a principal component analysis (PCA) on the biophysical variables-e.g., LAI, V C , ET a , LE, H, LST, albedo, emissivity, and R n -for 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2019. Principal component analysis was performed to reduce the large dataset and convert the data series into sets of uncorrelated linear values without losing relevant information 
Subsequently, we built a multiple linear regression model to determine ET a (predictand) in a simplified way. The selected variables were LST and H (predictors) due to their strong correlation over the years with land use and land cover classes (results obtained using PCA). This type of regression model assumes that there is a linear relationship between the response variable y and the predictor variables (e.g., x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n ); it may be described as follows: y = Œ≤ 0 + Œ≤ 1 x 1 + Œ≤ 2 x 2 + . . . + Œ≤ n x n + Œµ rr , wherein Œ≤ 0 is the constant value, Œ≤ 1 , . . . , Œ≤ n are regression coefficients, and Œµ rr is the random error. The threshold for predictor variable inclusion was p < 0.05. | Goodness of Fit: The model performance analysis was based on the root mean square error (RMSE, the values close to zero reduce error and increase accuracy), the mean absolute error (MAE), percent bias (PBIAS), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC), Willmott's index of agreement (d), which ranges from 0 to 1 (i.e., indicates no agreement at all and perfect agreement, respectively)  | Results and Discussion:  | Comparisons of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC): Based on the classification via the MapBiomas platform and on the Landsat-8 satellite, the thematic maps of land use and land cover for the years 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2019 were highlighted, with the main classes represented in Figure 
The lowest percentages of areas occupied by Caatinga vegetation were observed in 2015 (67.8%) and 2017 (68.7%), respectively. Compared to 2013, there was an average reduction of 2%, equivalent to 9123.65 ha of native forest (Caatinga), while in 2019, the reduction was only 0.45% (Table 
In 2013, the areas occupied with pasture represented 11.7%, agriculture 7.0%, and the mosaic of agriculture and pasture 8.64%, while areas with urban infrastructure and water bodies presented an occupation of 1.06 and 1.40%, respectively (Figure 
Drought is costly to Brazil, for it causes strong impacts on agriculture and cattle ranching. For example, the 2012-2013 drought resulted in economic losses of USD 1.5 billion for more than ten important crops in the region and USD 1.6 billion in cattle mortality 
The agricultural and cattle ranching activity were significant in 2015, 2017, and 2019 with 29.6, 28.7, and 27.7%, respectively. Among the agricultural activities, the class of pastures (in this study, there is no detailed distinction between irrigated and non-irrigated pasture areas) was responsible for the largest occupied area, with values of 55,356 ha in 2015; 60,156 ha in 2017, and 60,176 ha in 2019 (see Table 
The agriculture class in 2015, 2017, and 2019 showed territorial occupation of 34,209, 35,678, and 36,718 ha, respectively, with an average increase of 0.80% (3616 ha) compared to 2013 (Table  | Rainfall Variability in Land Cover Classes: Analyzing the spatiotemporal rainfall dynamics in the region over the 30 days preceding the passage of the Landsat-8 satellite on the four assessment dates (5 October 2013, 12 November 2015, 16 October 2017, and 7 November 2019) allowed us to observe the variation in rainfall distribution and volume, whose average accumulated values were 5.63, 1.7, 0.59, and 10.4 mm, for the respective dates. Despite the low rainfall volume observed in the region, some areas showed a tendency for higher rainfall occurrence, which may be conditioned to the native vegetation and orographic effects of the region (Figure  | Vegetation Cover Indices of the Municipality: Figure 
The results reported here contribute to understanding water limitations and vegetation behavior. Due to the proximity of the S√£o Francisco river, which supplies the irrigation systems, the areas of higher vegetation cover are found in the irrigated agriculture sites in the southern part of the municipality and the few remaining fragments of arboreal Caatinga, reaching average values of 58.71 ¬± 22.18% and 59.78 ¬± 18.94%, respectively, throughout the period under study (Figure 
Santos et al. 
It is essential to highlight that on 7 November 2019, there was an average increase of 46.81% of areas with V C higher than 50% in the northern part of the municipality (Figure 
During the studied dates, the LAI varied between 0.00 and 3.3 m 2 m -2 (Figure  | Land Surface Temperature (LST) in the Studied Classes: In the present study, the minimum LST values were seen in areas of water bodies, while the maximum LST values were seen in areas of exposed soils, located at points of pasture and degraded Caatinga, urban infrastructure (asphalt, concrete, and gravel surfaces), and agricultural areas undergoing soil preparation for cultivation (Figure 
It can be observed that the average LST values for the dates studied were higher in the areas dominated by pasture (47.69 ¬± 1.47 ‚Ä¢ C), herbaceous Caatinga (47.28 ¬± 1.27 ‚Ä¢ C), and shrub Caatinga (46.07 ¬± 1.44 ‚Ä¢ C), even higher than those observed in areas with urban infrastructure (45.80 ¬± 1.52 ‚Ä¢ C) (Figure 
On the other hand, it is observed, in general, that in areas dominated by arboreal Caatinga and agriculture, the average LST values are lower (38.99 ¬± 2.48 ‚Ä¢ C and 43.11 ¬± 2.30 ‚Ä¢ C, respectively) (Figure  | Variations of the Actual Evapotranspiration (ET a ) of Land Use Classes: Rainfall regime directly influenced ET a , so that on 16 October 2017 (Figure 
On the other hand, due to the effect of the increase in air temperature and atmospheric demand verified throughout the dry season in Petrolina, combined with the presence of preserved riparian forests along stretches of water bodies and continuous irrigation in crops, higher mean ET a values were observed in the arboreal Caatinga (4.73 ¬± 0.49 mm day -1 ) and agriculture (3.07 ¬± 1.23 mm day -1 ) classes. For presenting areas with irrigated and dry cultivation, the average values of this class become more variable. When there is a greater contribution of moisture added to more dense vegetation, there is a favoring of the local microclimate in the region 
The shrub and herbaceous Caatinga classes showed greater heterogeneity indicated by the largest standard deviations (2.42 ¬± 0.76 mm day -1 ) and (1.46 ¬± 0.71 mm day -1 ), respectively, relative to the arboreal Caatinga class (Figure 
The arboreal and shrub species play a fundamental eco-hydrological role, maintaining soil humidity and structuring its porosity, guaranteeing the maintenance of infiltration capacity and favoring the survival of species  | Statistical Relations between the Variables Studied and Land Use: In this study, we performed a PCA of the environmental variables in relation to land use and land cover classes. Therefore, the first two components with eigenvalues greater than 1.0 were extracted separately for the years 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2019 (Figure 
On the other hand, PC2 contributed more to the variability of the responses of the variables regarding the canopy interactions (LAI and V C ) due to the strong negative correlation with cultivated land (i.e., agriculture class) (Figure 
The results of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple regression analysis of the established model are presented in Table  | Conclusions: In this study, we point out a significant tendency to increase the agricultural areas, which results in the progressive decrease of the Brazilian Caatinga biome. The vegetation cover is directly influenced by the soil-water regime; years of higher rainfall result in a lower percentage of suppression of the native forest in the municipality of Petrolina, Pernambuco (Brazil). The areas with pasture class presented hotspots due to degradative processes and higher surface temperatures, influenced by the sensible heat flux. A gradual increase in LST is observed in the municipality and it may cause future risks to forest areas.
The SEBAL algorithm used in a semi-arid environment is a helpful tool to determine the energy and mass fluxes in different ecosystems. Notably, the Caatinga biome has particularities in biophysical according to the land cover and soil exposure on intra and inter-annual scales. The heterogeneity of the surface of the municipality of Petrolina, as a function of land use and land cover patterns, alters the energy exchange with the atmosphere. Our results also suggest a simplified and validated model for ET a determination in a semi-arid environment. The regression model could accurately predict the spatial distribution of ET a , with high R 2 and LCCC and low RMSE value.
Thus, it is possible to suggest that the implementation of agricultural activities in the Petrolina should be carried out in a planned and sustainable way in order to mitigate the impacts that anthropic action causes on the Caatinga, especially with the increased vulnerability of this biome to the desertification process. However, further research is needed to investigate the spatial variations of the types of crops covering the soil in the municipality, as well as the dynamics of fires and their impacts on the diversity of the Caatinga biome. Field surveys and the use of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) could provide more detailed information at an intermediate and fine scale.

"Urban sprawl and its impact on land use land cover dynamics of Sekondi-Takoradi metropolitan assembly, Ghana",Ernest Biney; Ebenezer Boakye,"In Ghana, Sekondi-Takoradi has been one of the preferred cities for many people due to the prevalence of industries, the presence of harbor, and the airport. However, the discovery of oil off the coast of the Western region, where Sekondi-Takoradi is the administrative and economic capital makes it more attractive to people in the area. This has increased the number of urban dwellers and resulted in the conversion of different and Land Use /Land Cover (LULC) forms into urban or built-up areas. Using Landsat imageries from 1991, 2002, 2008, and  2018  of Sekondi-Takoradi, together with geospatial and Shannon's entropy techniques, this paper assesses the impact of urban sprawl on land use and land use dynamics within the metropolis. Results of land use land cover change showed significant changes during the period of study. Settlement increased by 25.93% whereas water, vegetation, and bare land reduced by 0.08%, 16.00%, and 9.86% respectively. This reveals the occurrence of an unguided expansion of built-up area in the metropolis. Also, results from entropy calculations showed high entropy values ranging from 2.42 to 2.50, though the entropy values did not significantly change throughout the study. This indicates that the metropolis has been experiencing sprawl from 1991 to 2018 and thus urban development has significantly changed the land cover stratum of the metropolis. The findings demonstrate the value of spatial modeling in environmental management and urban planning.","Introduction: Since time immemorial, the earth's surface has been changing at different spaces and time scales. These changes, of which some take place at a short time and others at longer years are caused by natural phenomena and human activities 
In recent times, industries and developments are increasing the population of urban dwellers and urban centers. The increase in urban population and urban centers are changing vegetative lands or land covers into impervious surfaces. Although these conversions and their effects are globally found in metropolitan areas, it is becoming a disaster in developing countries 
This paper is sectioned mainly into introduction, materials and methods, results and discussions, and conclusion. However, some main sections are further organized into subsection headings. | Materials and methods:  | Study area: Sekondi-Takoradi Metropolis ( Fig. 
The Metropolis serves as an industrial and commercial center and this attracts migrants across the nation to the Metropolis. Takoradi, for instance, houses about 10.2% of all industrial establishments across the country ( Obeng-Odoom, 2019 ). Industries such as timber, plywood, shipbuilding, railway repair and oil industries are major industries found in Sekondi-Takoradi  | Data: The data used for the study are shown in Table  | Image pre-processing and classification: The images obtained from the Landsat satellite were in Tier 1 and Tier 2. The Tier 1 images of 
The identified land cover classes were trained from the images in the google earth engine using a signature editor tool. The random forest algorithm or classifier under the supervised classification in the google earth engine was used to classify the images into four classes. Random forest was chosen due to its usefulness in calculating important information about errors, variable importance, and data outliers. Such information can be used to assess the performance of the model and make changes to the training data if necessary  | Accuracy assessment: Assessing the quality of results after classification is performed from satellite images is very important for change detection analysis  | Change detection: Change detection is the process of observing the differences that have taken place in the state of an object, viewed at different periods. To analyze the changes in the land cover, post-classification change detection was used. The reason for using post-classification change detection is that it provides comprehensive information on changes that occurs in a class cover to other classes concerning the place of change, the extent, and the amount of the change  | Urban sprawl measurement: Urban sprawl throughout 1991 to 2018 was measured by the use of Shannon entropy together with GIS tools. Before the measurement of sprawl was carried out, built-up images were extracted from the classified images to obtain urban built-up images. The raster calculator in QGIS was used to extract build-up images from 1991 to 2018 and then reclassified the images into build-up and non-build-up. Thirteen concentric or multiple ring buffer zones were generated around a chosen center point. The central business district, Takoradi market circle was chosen as the center point for generating the buffer zones. Studies have used different geometries for creating buffer zones; some use circular or concentric circles as buffer zones whereas others use multiple square buffers 
From the Eq. ( 
The Shannon entropy (E n ) values vary from 0 to the value of Log (n). When the value is closer to 0, the distribution of the variables is highly concentrated in one zone and if the value is closer to log (n), the distribution is dispersed 
.A flowchart that summarizes the methodology is presented in Fig.  | Results and discussions:  | Land use land cover maps: As shown in 
Comparing the 2018 classified map to the 2008 classified map, it can be seen that, in 2018, there was a reduction in the area coverage of water, vegetation, and bare land. Settlement was the only class that had an increase in its area coverage. This indicates that building and construction have increased significantly over the years. Also, transitioning from 1991 to 2018, there has been a persistent increase in settlement while some of the classes have had an inconsistent or irregular increase or decrease in their land cover. Water, for instance, increased in 2002 but decreased in 2008 and 2018. Vegetation and bare lands, however, decreased throughout the years. Table  | Accuracy assessment: Accuracy assessment is essential in determining the quality of classification used for change detection and urban change analysis. The accuracy of the various classified maps was computed through the use of the error matrix and Kappa statistic. Error matrix is a table with classified data at the rows and reference data at the columns  | The trend of land use land cover changes from 1991 to 2018: Trend analysis on land use and land cover indicates where the land cover types are changing to. In this study, this was done by using the initial years of comparison as the base. Between 1991 and 2002, water decreased by 0.03 km 2 , vegetation decreased by 1.39 km 2 , settlement increased by 2.95 km 2 and bare land decreased by 2.38 km 2 ( Fig. 
Generally, when the use of land in an urban center is changing from vegetation cover to other land uses, build-up or settlement becomes the dominant land use. The changing trend in the classes between 2008 and 2018 is evidence of build-up being predominant in the change of vegetative class to other land classes. Observing from Figure  | Urban sprawl analysis: To analyze the nature and pattern of urban sprawl, the land cover maps 
From Table 
Second, with a concentric circle of 1 km intervals starting from the city center, the reclassified built-up and non-built-up images were divided into thirteen buffer zones. This was to help in identifying the direction of urban land development 
The build-up density values in each zone, the Shannon entropy values, and the relative Shannon entropy values were calculated for the various years of the study. The results are presented in Table 
Table  | Conclusion: GIS and remote sensing techniques were used to examine and determine changes that took place in the study area from 1991 to 2018. Results of the study showed considerable change in the land covers in which settlement or built-up had an average yearly increment over the 27years (from 1991 to 2018). Water, however, decreased from 1991 to 2002, but increased in 2008 and decreased in 2018. Vegetation and bare land showed a constant decrease from 1991 to 2018. Increasing urban population and its associated demand for residential, industrial and commercial purposes was identified as the major factor behind the increase in settlement and built-up. This, undoubtedly, support the notion that human activities or anthropogenic activities greatly affect the earth's surface. The study also used Shannon's entropy to measure urban sprawl.

Multi-scenario simulation of land use/land cover change and water yield evaluation coupled with the GMOP-PLUS-InVEST model: A case study of the Nansi Lake Basin in China,Yingchun Liu; Yande Jing; Shanmei Han,"Changes in land use/land cover (LULC) can impact water yield (WY) by altering the structural layout and functions of terrestrial ecosystems. Therefore, to ensure regional economic and ecosystem sustainability, it is critical to investigate the correlation between LULC change and WY. The GMOP-PLUS-InVEST (GPI) coupling model based on the gray multi-objective optimization model, the patch-generating land use simulation model, and the integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade-offs model was used in this study. Establishing three different scenarios: business as usual (BAU), economic development scenario (ED), and ecological conservation scenario (EC) to predict the LULC distribution pattern in the Nansi Lake Basin (NLB) in 2035, and obtain the WY from 2000 to 2035. Getis-Ord Gi* and Anselin Local Moran's I were used to investigate the spatial-temporal features of WY at the grid scale. The results indicated that: (1) The dominant LULC types of the NLB were farmland and construction land. The primary transfer trend was construction land encroaching on farmland due to the acceleration of the urbanization process and policy intervention. (2) The results of the LULC simulation in the NLB in 2035 showed that the BAU had a continuous trend of change for nearly 20 years; Under the ED, the intensity of construction land encroachment on farmland was accelerating; Under the EC, an apparent increase in the proportion of ecological land could be seen, and the contradiction between construction land and farmland had eased, which was expected to be more in line with the policy and planning objectives. (3) LULC change had a significant effect on WY. From 2000 to 2035, WY of the NLB continued to increase, and in 2035, the WY under different scenarios was ED > EC > BAU. Spatially it always showed a high value distribution in the south and west in the NLB. The GPI coupling model can be used for LULC optimization and ecosystem service evaluation, providing ideas for rational planning of future LULC. Research results have significant reference significance for the formulation of LULC policies and the protection and restoration of ecological environment of the NLB.","Introduction: Water yield (WY) in ecosystem services is the foundation of various ecological processes and ecological service functions 
In terms of WY evaluation, the existing studies mostly adopt two methods for quantitative evaluation: value-based and physical quantity evaluation 
Forecasting the possible implications of long-term LULC change on the WY of the ecosystem is crucial for formulating rational and timely ecological protection plans in advance. Cellular automata (CA)-Markov 
Previous land prediction models utilized a bottom-up approach to assign each land type to an appropriate location but relied on their individual transformation principles and are devoid of optimized LULC structures. Fewer studies have been conducted on LULC optimization from the perspective of improving the comprehensive benefits of LULC. Few studies explored LULC optimization using multi-objective optimization scenario combination prediction models that analyze LULC quantity, spatial layout, and collaborative optimization of benefits 
The Nansi Lake Basin (NLB) is situated in the Southern Shandong Economic Circle of China. In recent years, the economic level of the NLB has shown improvement, the industrialization and urbanization process has accelerated. However, due to the region's heavy responsibility of grain production, the contradiction between human and land has become increasingly prominent. To address this issue, the Department of Natural Resources of Shandong Province issued the ""Special plan for ecological protection and restoration of the NLB (2021-2035)"" in 2022. Hereinafter referred to as ""Special plan (2021-2035)"". This plan aims to build an ecological pattern of ""one core, one screen, two belts, three zones, and multiple corridors"" to achieve the development goal of creating an excellent ecological environment in the NLB characterized by ""green mountains, clear water, lush forests, fertile fields, and beautiful lakes"". In light of this, the objective of this study was to establish three scenarios: business as usual (BAU), economic development scenario (ED), and ecological conservation scenario (EC), using the GPI coupling model, anticipate the future distribution of LULC of the NLB, evaluate its WY, and analyze how the WY is spatially correlated. Specifically, the following objectives were addressed: (1) Identify the spatial-temporal changes in LULC of the NLB from 2000 to 2020. (2) Make quantitative predictions and spatial simulation of the LULC in the NLB under three scenarios (BAU, ED, EC) in 2035. (3) Evaluate the spatial-temporal changes and spatial correlation of WY of the NLB from 2000 to 2035. Overall, this study reveals the influence of LULC changes on WY, and provides a reliable scientific proof and reference for the rational development of land resources and restoration of ecological environment in the basin. | Study area and data sources:  | Study area: Nansi Lake, situated at the junction of Shandong and Jiangsu provinces, is composed of four interconnected lakes, namely Weishan Lake, Zhaoyang Lake, Dushan Lake, and Nanyang Lake.

(Table  | Methods: The research framework used in this study can be broken down into three main components (Fig.  | Optimization of LULC structure based on GMOP: The GMOP model is an innovative approach that combines and advances the gray linear regression and multi-objective programming techniques. It not only accommodates the kinds of nondeterminacy in goal functions and restraint condition related to real-world LULC, but also addresses multi-objective issues during the optimization process of LULC structure  | Decision variables: In this study, the setting of decision variables was selected in consideration of data availability and operability of the NLB. Six decision variables were selected, including farmland, forestland, grassland, water area construction land, and unused land.   | Scenario settings: BAU: Based on the probability matrix of land transfer from 2000 to 2020, the quantitative demand for various LULC types in 2035 was calculated using linear regression.
ED: The economic benefit objective function is:
where F 1 (x) is the economic benefit; C j is the economic benefit per unit area of each decision variable, and x j is the decision variable.
Using GM (1,1) model, it was predicted that the economic benefits per unit area of farmland, forestland, grassland, water area, and construction land in the target year are 5.95/hm 2 , 5.74/hm 2 , 41.9/hm 2 , 6.61/hm 2 , and 150.16/hm 2 , respectively. Because the economic benefits of unused land were not obvious, the economic benefits of unused land were set at 0.01/hm 2 . Finally, the economic benefit objective function coefficient of the NLB was obtained (unit: 10,000 yuan/hm 2 ):
Max (x) = 5.95x 1 + 5.74x 2 + 41.90x 3 + 6.61x 4 + 150.16x 5 + 0.01x 6 EC: Set target functions to maximize the total ecosystem service value (ESV) supplied by all LULC types. The ecological benefit objective function is:
where F 2 (x) is ESV; X j is the decision variable of j LULC type (x 1-6 represents farmland, forestland, grassland, water area, construction land, and unused land, respectively); D j represents the ESV per unit area. This study used ESV to characterize ecological benefits. To reduce errors, based on the ""Unit Area ESV Equivalency Table"" 
Max (x) = 0.84 x 1 + 4.10x 2 + 2.52 x 3 + 26.20 x 4 + 0 x 5 + 5.42x 6 | Constraint setting: (1) Total land
(2) Population The population of the construction land should be controlled within the target predicted population range of the study area:
where m is the average population density of the construction land, and P is the total population. gray GM (1,1) model was used to forecast the average population density and total population of construction land in 2035, determining m = 13.58, P = 1012234.
(3) Farmland According to the requirements of ""grain for green"" and ""returning farmland to grassland"" in the ""Special plan (2021-2035)"", while strictly observing the arable land minimum, the area of basic farmland in various regions was protected to guarantee the growth of the agricultural economy. The farmland area should be smaller than the status quo and larger than the arable land minimum:
(4) Forestland According to the requirements of ""grain for green"" in the ""Special plan (2021-2035)"", the proportion of forests should be increased. To ensure ecological construction and increase forest coverage, the area of forestland of the NLB in 2035 should not be smaller than the current situation:
(5) Grassland From 2000 to 2020, the total grassland area decreased year by year and was mainly converted into farmland. According to the requirements of ""returning farmland to grassland"" in the ""Special plan (2021-2035)"", the percentage of grassland needs to be improved. In conjunction with the economic development requirements of the NLB, the grassland area should be maintained below the grassland area in 2000:
(6) Water area From 2000 to 2020, the water area of Nansi Lake changed significantly. To coordinate the balanced development of economy and ecology, the peak value of water area for nearly 20 years was set as the lower limit, and the valley value was set as the upper limit:
(7) Construction land In the light of the ""Special plan (2021-2035)"", taking urbanization process and economic development requirements into account, the construction land area of the NLB in 2035 should be at least larger than the current situation: | Solution: Solve the functions of the above constraints using Lingo 18 software and ultimately obtain the land demand quantity for the multi-objective optimization scenarios in 2035. | Optimization of spatial LULC structure based on PLUS: CA model exhibits inadequacies in both conversion rule mining strategies and simulation strategies for landscape dynamic change. Therefore, this study utilized the PLUS model which encompasses both LEAS and CARS to simulate future LULC changes. LEAS provides the ability to dissect the dynamics of LULC change over a certain period of time with enhanced explanatory power, whereas CARS blends a random seed generation mechanism with a threshold reduction mechanism to automatically generate spatial-temporally dynamic simulated patches within the restraints of probability of occurrence. | Model input: To estimate the appropriate probability of different LULC types, this study utilized LULC data from two phases to obtain LULC extension map. In accordance with the natural environment, socioeconomic development of the research area, previous studies  | Accuracy verification: By utilizing LULC data and driving factor data in 2010 and 2020, this study adopted the PLUS model to make simulations of LULC landscape pattern of the NLB in 2020. Through a comparison between the actual and simulated results, it was found that the overall accuracy reached 0.92, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.81. These results demonstrate that the PLUS model exhibited excellent simulation accuracy for the research area and is highly reliable and applicable. Based on this, the study anticipated and analyzed LULC under diverse scenarios in 2035 via the LULC data for 2020. | Evaluation of WY changes: To assess the WY of the NLB, we employed the WY module of the InVEST model in this study. The Budyko water heat coupling equilibrium hypothesis and annual average precipitation data were utilized to determine the annual WY Y of each grid unit √ó in the NLB 
where AET(x) represents the actual annual evapotranspiration of grid unit x, and P represents the annual precipitation of grid unit x.
In the water balance formula, the vegetation evapotranspiration for LULC types was calculated using the formula:
where PET(x) represents the potential evapotranspiration, œâ nonphysical parameters that represent the natural climate-soil properties. | Spatial relevance evaluation based on grid: To generate a grid of 3 km √ó 3 km consistent with the study area, we employed ArcGIS software. Subsequently, we linked the WY data to the grid to obtain the WY value for each unit area. Utilizing GeoDa software, the global auto-correlation results were obtained by first calculating Moran's value at the grid scale. The distribution of WY hot spots in the NLB was analyzed using Getis Ord Gi*. Finally, local auto-correlation results and LISA aggregation graphs were obtained by utilizing Anselin Local Moran's I. | Results:  | Spatial-temporal changes in LULC in NLB: According to the findings presented in Table 
According to Fig.  | Multi-scenario simulation based on PLUS: According to Table  | Contribution rate of driving factors for LULC expansion: The LEAS and CARS are the central components of the PLUS model. The LEAS uses a built-in random forest regression training process to provide directly quantitative information on how the various drivers affect the extent of the contribution of each LULC type to the expansion. This information helps us understand the potential causes of LULC change. Fig.  | Evaluation of WY change based on InVEST: The model was utilized to assess the changes in WY in the NLB by inputting the LULC simulation results in 2000, 2010, 2020, and different scenarios in 2035 (Fig.  | Spatial correlation of WY in NLB: From a spatial correlation perspective, the Moran's I value of WY in the NLB from 2000 to 2020 and under different scenarios in 2035 were all greater than 0, with values of 0.395, 0.500, 0.496, 0.593, 0.617, and 0.612 respectively. This result indicates that the territorial distribution of WY in the NLB exhibited certain clustering phenomena. Through Getis-Ord Gi* analysis, significant clustering regions can be identified. These are locations where high or low value elements cluster spatially, with cold and hot spots representing low and high values respectively. The Getis-Ord Gi* analysis (Fig.  | Discussion: The results of the study showed that LULC transfers were occurring all the time in the NLB from 2000 to 2020, with farmland and construction land being the most significant 
Based on the results of LULC simulation in the NLB in 2035, evaluation results of the InVEST model revealed that a significant increase in WY under three different scenarios, with the highest WY observed under the ED and the lowest under the BAU 
Policies and regulations in different periods have a direct impact on  the direction of LULC, but most previous studies did not a detailed analysis of policy scenarios when establishing simulation models  | Conclusion: In this study, we used the GPI coupling model to optimize the LULC layout in the NLB under different scenarios and to investigate its impact on WY. Our simulation results demonstrated that compared to the BAU and ED, the EC showed a decrease in construction land expansion rate while ensuring basic farmland, alleviating the conflict between construction land and farmland, and increasing the proportion of ecological land, which is more aligned with the goals of the ""Special plan (2021-2035)"". Our assessment of the spatial-temporal pattern of WY in the NLB helped to understand the consequences of LULC change on WY. By examining changes in WY, we can comprehend the comprehensive impact and relative importance of LULC change on it, helping to address LULC planning issues and provide ideas for LULC decision-making. Since entering the 21st century, construction land encroaching on farmland has been the main trend of LULC change in the NLB and has resulted in the most significant land conflict issue in the region. Balancing urban expansion while ensuring the minimum amount of arable land to guarantee food security is the primary challenge facing the basin presently. From the perspective of ecosystem service changes, reasonable LULC planning can have a positive impact on WY to some extent. Effective management practices can further help managers formulate more comprehensive spatial planning, thereby ensuring that the efficiency of land resource use in the NLB is improved and the ecological environment is restored. Although this study has certain limitations, the results are practical and policy-relevant and can provide a reference for LULC change and ecosystem service function planning in the NLB and other similar regions.

The processes responsible for fluxes from land have been divided into three categories 
Global models estimate the anthropogenic land CO 2 flux considering only the impact of direct effects, and only those areas that were subject to intense and direct management such as clear-cut harvest. It is important to note, that DGVMs also estimate the non-anthropogenic land CO 2 flux (Land Sink) that results from indirect and natural effects (Table

Land-based mitigation measures represent some of the most important options currently available. They can both deliver carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and substitute for fossil fuels, thereby enabling emissions reductions in other sectors. The rapid deployment of AFOLU measures is essential in all pathways staying within the limits of the remaining budget for a 1.5¬∞C target (high confidence). Where carefully and appropriately implemented, AFOLU mitigation measures are uniquely positioned to deliver substantial co-benefits and help address many of the wider challenges associated with land management. If AFOLU measures are deployed badly then, when taken together with the increasing need to produce sufficient food, feed, fuel and wood, they may exacerbate trade-offs with the conservation of habitats, adaptation, biodiversity and other services. At the same time the capacity of the land to support these functions may be threatened by climate change itself (high confidence). {IPCC AR6 WGI, Figure SPM.7; IPCC AR6 WGII, 7.1, 7.6}
The AFOLU (managed land) sector, on average, accounted for 13-21% of global total anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the period 2010-2019 (medium confidence). At the same time managed and natural terrestrial ecosystems were a carbon sink, absorbing around one third of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions (medium confidence). Estimated anthropogenic net CO 2 emissions from AFOLU (based on book-keeping models) result in a net source of +5.9 ¬± 4.1 GtCO 2 yr -1 between 2010 and 2019 with an unclear trend. Based on FAOSTAT or national GHG inventories, the net CO 2 emissions from AFOLU were 0.0 to +0.8 GtCO 2 yr -1 over the same period. There is a discrepancy in the reported CO 2 AFOLU emissions magnitude because alternative methodological approaches that incorporate different assumptions are used. If the managed and natural responses of all land to both anthropogenic environmental change and natural climate variability, estimated to be a gross sink of -12.5 ¬± 3.2 GtCO 2 yr -1 for the period 2010-2019, are included with land use emissions, then land overall, constituted a net sink of -6.6 ¬± 5.2 GtCO 2 yr -1 in terms of CO 2 emissions (medium confidence). {7.2, 7.2.2.5, Table 
There are substantial regional differences, with losses of carbon generally observed in tropical regions and gains in temperate and
Global databases make different choices about which emissions and removals occurring on land are considered anthropogenic. Currently, net CO 2 land fluxes from land reported by global book-keeping models used here differ from those from the aggregate global net emissions based on national GHG inventories. This difference, which has been considered in the literature, mainly reflects differences in how anthropogenic forest sinks and areas of managed land are defined. Other reasons for this difference, which are more difficult to quantify, can arise from the limited representation of land management in global models and varying levels of accuracy and completeness of estimated LULUCF fluxes in national GHG inventories. Neither method is inherently preferable. This chapter reports estimates from different databases and approaches, but uses CO 2 LULUCF from book-keeping models to report overall emissions to ensure consistency and comparability across chapters.
boreal regions. Agricultural methane (CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions are estimated to average 157 ¬± 47.1 MtCH 4 yr -1 and 6.6 ¬± 4.0 MtN 2 O yr -1 or 4.2 ¬± 1.3 and 1.8 ¬± 1.1 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 (using IPCC AR6 GWP100 values for CH 4 and N 2 O) respectively between 2010 and 2019. AFOLU CH 4 emissions continue to increase (high confidence), the main source of which is enteric fermentation from ruminant animals (high confidence). Similarly, AFOLU N 2 O emissions are increasing, dominated by agriculture, notably from manure application, nitrogen deposition, and nitrogen fertiliser use (high confidence). In addition to being a source and sink for GHG emissions, land plays an important role in climate through albedo effects, evapotranspiration and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their mix, although the combined role in total climate forcing is unclear and varies strongly with bioclimatic region and management type. {2.4.2.5, 7.2, 7.2.1, 7.2.3, 7.3}
The AFOLU sector offers significant near-term mitigation potential at relatively low cost but cannot compensate for delayed emission reductions in other sectors (high evidence, medium agreement). The AFOLU sector can provide 20-30% (interquartile range) of the global mitigation needed for a 1.5¬∞C or 2¬∞C pathway towards 2050 (robust evidence, medium agreement), though there are highly variable mitigation strategies for how AFOLU potential can be deployed for achieving climate targets. The estimated likely economic (<USD100 tCO 2 -eq -1 ) AFOLU sector mitigation potential is 8 to 14 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 between 2020 and 2050, with the bottom end of this range representing the mean from integrated assessment models (IAMs) and the upper end representing the mean estimate from global sectoral studies. The economic potential is about half of the technical potential from AFOLU, and about 30-50% could be achieved under USD20 tCO 2 -eq -1 . The implementation of robust measurement, reporting and verification processes is paramount to improving the transparency of net-carbon-stock changes per land unit to prevent misleading assumptions or claims on mitigation. {7. 
Most mitigation options are available and ready to deploy. Emissions reductions can be unlocked relatively quickly, whereas CDR needs upfront investment. Sustainable intensification in agriculture, shifting diets, and reducing food waste could enhance efficiencies and reduce agricultural land needs, and are therefore critical for enabling supply-side measures such as reforestation, restoration, as well as decreasing CH 4 and N 2 O emissions from agricultural production. In addition, emerging technologies (e.g., vaccines or inhibitors) have the potential to substantially increase CH 4 mitigation potential beyond current estimates. AFOLU mitigation is not only relevant in countries with large land areas. Many smaller countries and regions, particularly with wetlands, have disproportionately high levels of AFOLU mitigation potential density. {7.4, 7.5}
The economic and political feasibility of implementing AFOLU mitigation measures is hampered by persistent barriers. Assisting countries to overcome barriers will help to achieve significant short-term mitigation (medium confidence).
Finance forms a critical barrier to achieving these gains as currently mitigation efforts rely principally on government sources and funding mechanisms which do not provide sufficient resources to enable the economic potential to be realised. Differences in cultural values, governance, accountability and institutional capacity are also important barriers. Climate change could also emerge as a barrier to AFOLU mitigation, although the IPCC AR6 WGI contribution to AR6 indicated that an increase in the capacity of natural sinks may occur, despite changes in climate (medium confidence). The continued loss of biodiversity makes ecosystems less resilient to climate change extremes and this may further jeopardise the achievement of the AFOLU mitigation potentials indicated in this chapter (IPCC AR6 WGII and IPBES) (high confidence). {7.4, 7.6; IPCC AR6 WGI, Figure SPM.7}
Bioenergy and other bio-based options represent an important share of the total mitigation potential. The range of recent estimates for the technical bioenergy potential when constrained by food security and environmental considerations is 5-50 and 50-250 EJ yr -1 by 2050 for residues and dedicated biomass production system respectively. These estimates fall within previously estimated ranges (medium agreement). Poorly planned deployment of biomass production and afforestation options for in-forest carbon sequestration may conflict with environmental and social dimensions of sustainability (high confidence). The global technical CDR potential of BECCS by 2050 (considering only the technical capture of CO 2 and storage underground) is estimated at 5.9 mean (0.5-11.3) GtCO 2 yr -1 , of which 1.6 (0.8-3.5) GtCO 2 yr -1 is available at below USD100 tCO 2 -1
(medium confidence). Bioenergy and other bio-based products provide additional mitigation through the substitution of fossil fuels fossil-based products (high confidence). These substitution effects are reported in other sectors. Wood used in construction may reduce emissions associated with steel and concrete use. The agriculture and forestry sectors can devise management approaches that enable biomass production and use for energy in conjunction with the production of food and timber, thereby reducing the conversion pressure on natural ecosystems (medium confidence). {7.4}
The deployment of all land-based mitigation measures can provide multiple co-benefits, but there are also risks and trade-offs from misguided or inappropriate land management (high confidence). Such risks can best be managed if AFOLU mitigation is pursued in response to the needs and perspectives of multiple stakeholders to achieve outcomes that maximise synergies while limiting trade-offs (medium confidence). The results of implementing AFOLU measures are often variable and highly context specific. Depending on local conditions (e.g., ecosystem, climate, food system, land ownership) and management strategies (e.g., scale, method), mitigation measures have the potential to positively or negatively impact biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, air quality, water availability and quality, soil productivity, rights infringements, food security, and human well-being. Mitigation measures addressing GHGs may also affect other climate forcers such as albedo and evapotranspiration. Integrated responses that contribute to mitigation, adaptation, and other land challenges will have greater likelihood of being successful (high confidence); measures which provide additional benefits to biodiversity and human well-being are sometimes described as 'Nature-Based Solutions'. {7.1, 7.4, 7.6} | AFOLU mitigation measures have been well understood for decades but deployment remains slow and emissions trends indicate unsatisfactory progress despite beneficial contributions to global emissions reduction from forestrelated options (high confidence).: Globally, the AFOLU sector has so far contributed modestly to net mitigation, as past policies have delivered about 0.65 GtCO 2 yr -1 of mitigation during 2010-2019 or 1.4% of global gross emissions (high confidence). The majority (>80%) of emission reduction resulted from forestry measures (high confidence). Although the mitigation potential of AFOLU measures is large from a biophysical and ecological perspective, its feasibility is hampered by lack of institutional support, uncertainty over longterm additionality and trade-offs, weak governance, fragmented land ownership, and uncertain permanence effects. Despite these impediments to change, AFOLU mitigation options are demonstrably effective and with appropriate support can enable rapid emission reductions in most countries. {7.4, 7.6}
Concerted, rapid and sustained effort by all stakeholders, from policy makers and investors to land owners and managers is a pre-requisite to achieving high levels of mitigation in the AFOLU sector (high confidence). To date USD0.7 billion yr -1 is estimated to have been spent on AFOLU mitigation. This is well short of the more than USD400 billion yr -1 that is estimated to be necessary to deliver the up to 30% of global mitigation effort envisaged in deep mitigation scenarios (medium confidence). This estimate of the global funding requirement is smaller than current subsidies provided to agriculture and forestry. Making this funding available would require a change in flows of money and determination of who pays.
A gradual redirection of existing agriculture and forestry subsidies would greatly advance mitigation. Effective policy interventions and national (investment) plans as part of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), specific to local circumstances and needs, are urgently needed to accelerate the deployment of AFOLU mitigation options. These interventions are effective when they include funding schemes and long-term consistent support for implementation with governments taking the initiative together with private funders and non-state actors. {7.6}
Realising the mitigation potential of the AFOLU sector depends strongly on policies that directly address emissions and drive the deployment of land-based mitigation options, consistent with carbon prices in deep mitigation scenarios (high confidence). Examples of successful policies and measures include establishing and respecting tenure rights and community forestry, improved agricultural management and sustainable intensification, biodiversity conservation, payments for ecosystem services, improved forest management and wood chain usage, bioenergy, voluntary supply chain management efforts, consumer behaviour campaigns, private funding and joint regulatory efforts to avoid, for example, leakage. The efficacy of different policies, however, will depend on numerous region-specific factors. In addition to funding, these factors include governance, institutions, long-term consistent execution of measures, and the specific policy setting (high confidence). {7.6}
There is a discrepancy, equating to 5.5 GtCO 2 yr -1 between alternative methods of accounting for anthropogenic land CO 2 fluxes. Reconciling these methods greatly enhances the credibility of AFOLU-based emissions offsetting. It would also assist in assessing collective progress in a global stocktake (high confidence). The principal accounting approaches are national GHG inventories (NGHGI) and global modelling approaches. NGHGI, based on IPCC guidelines, consider a much larger area of forest to be under human management than global models. NGHGI consider the fluxes due to human-induced environmental change on this area to be anthropogenic and are thus reported. Global models,
Addressing the many knowledge gaps in the development and testing of AFOLU mitigation options can rapidly advance the likelihood of achieving sustained mitigation (high confidence). Research priorities include improved quantification of anthropogenic and natural GHG fluxes and emissions modelling, better understanding of the impacts of climate change on the mitigation potential, permanence and additionality of estimated mitigation actions, and improved (real time and cheap) measurement, reporting and verification. There is a need to include a greater suite of mitigation measures in IAMs, informed by more realistic assessments that take into account local circumstances and socio-economic factors and cross-sector synergies and trade-offs. Finally, there is a critical need for more targeted research to develop appropriate country-level, locally specific, policy and land management response options. These options could support more specific NDCs with AFOLU measures that enable mitigation while also contributing to biodiversity conservation, ecosystem functioning, livelihoods for millions of farmers and foresters, and many other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (high confidence). {7.7} | Introduction:  | Key Findings from Previous Reports: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Uses (AFOLU) is unique due to its capacity to mitigate climate change through greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions, as well as enhance removals 
The SRCCL (IPCC 2019) outlined with medium evidence and medium agreement that supply-side agriculture and forestry measures had an economic (at USD100 tCO 2 -eq -1 ) mitigation potential of 7.2-10.6 GtCO 2 -eq -1 in 2030 (using GWP100 and multiple IPCC values for CH 4 and N 2 O) of which about a third was estimated as achievable at <USD20 tCO 2 -eq -1 . Agricultural measures were reported as sensitive to carbon price, with cropland and grazing land soil organic carbon management having the greatest potential at USD20 tCO 2 -eq -1 and restoration of organic soils at USD100 tCO 2 -eq -1 . Forestry measures were less sensitive to carbon price, but varied regionally, with reduced deforestation, forest management and afforestation having the greatest potential depending on region. Although demand-side measures related to food could in theory make a large contribution to mitigation, in reality the contribution has been very small. Overall, the dependency of mitigation within AFOLU on a complex range of factors, from population growth, economic and technological developments, to the sustainability of mitigation measures and impacts of climate change, was suggested to make realisation highly challenging (IPCC 2019).
Land can only be part of the solution alongside rapid emission reduction in other sectors 
Since the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), the share of AFOLU to anthropogenic GHG emissions had remained largely unchanged at 13-21% of total GHG emissions (medium confidence), though uncertainty in estimates of both sources and sinks of CO 2 , exacerbated by difficulties in separating natural and anthropogenic fluxes, was emphasised. Models indicated land (including the natural sink) to have very likely provided a net removal of CO 2 between 2007 and 2016. As in AR5, land cover change, notably deforestation, was identified as a major driver of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions while agriculture was a major driver of the increasing anthropogenic CH 4 and N 2 O emissions.
In terms of mitigation, without reductions in overall anthropogenic emissions, increased reliance on large-scale land-based mitigation was predicted, which would add to the many already competing demands on land. However, some mitigation measures were suggested to not compete with other land uses, while also having multiple co-benefits, including adaptation capacity and potential synergies with some Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As in AR5, there was large uncertainty surrounding mitigation within AFOLU, in part because current carbon stocks and fluxes are unclear and subject to temporal variability. Additionally, the non-additive nature of individual measures that are often inter-linked and the highly context specific applicability of measures, causes further uncertainty. Many AFOLU measures were considered well-established and some achievable at low to moderate cost, yet contrasting economic drivers, insufficient policy, lack of incentivisation and institutional support to stimulate implementation among the many stakeholders involved, in regionally diverse contexts, was recognised as hampering realisation of potential.
None the less, the importance of mitigation within AFOLU was highlighted in all IPCC reports, with modelled scenarios demonstrating the considerable potential role and land-based mitigation forming an important component of pledged mitigation in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. The sector was identified as the only one in which large-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR) may currently and at short term be possible (e.g., through afforestation/reforestation or soil organic carbon management). This CDR component was deemed crucial to limit climate change and its impacts, which would otherwise lead to enhanced release of carbon from land. However, the SRCCL emphasised that mitigation cannot be pursued in isolation. The need for integrated response options, that mitigate and adapt to climate change, but also deal with land degradation and desertification, while enhancing food and fibre security, biodiversity and contributing to other SDGs has been made clear  | Boundaries, Scope and Changing Context of the Current Report: This chapter assesses GHG fluxes between land and the atmosphere due to AFOLU, the associated drivers behind these fluxes, mitigation response options and related policy, at time scales of 2030 and 2050. Land and its management has important links with other sectors and therefore associated chapters within this report, notably concerning the provision of food, feed, fuel or fibre for human consumption and societal well-being (Chapter 5), for bioenergy (Chapter 6), the built environment (Chapter 9), transport (Chapter 10) and industry 
As highlighted in both AR5 and the SRCCL, there is a complex interplay between land management and GHG fluxes as illustrated in Figure 
Mitigation measures are broadly categorised as those relating to (i) forests and other ecosystems (ii) agriculture (iii) biomass production for products and bioenergy and (iv) demand-side levers.
Assessment is made in the context that land-mitigation is expected to contribute roughly 25% of the 2030 mitigation pledged in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement 
1. What is the latest estimated (economic) mitigation potential of AFOLU measures according to both sectoral studies and integrated assessment models, and how much of this may be realistic within each global region? 2. How do we realise the mitigation potential, while minimising trade-offs and risks and maximising co-benefits that can enhance food and fibre security, conserve biodiversity and address other land challenges?
3. How effective have policies been so far and what additional policies or incentives might enable realisation of mitigation potential and at what costs?
This chapter first outlines the latest trends in AFOLU fluxes and the methodology supporting their estimation (Section 7.2). Direct and indirect drivers behind emission trends are discussed in Section 7.3. Mitigation measures, their costs, co-benefits, trade-offs, estimated regional potential and contribution within integrated global mitigation scenarios, is presented in Sections 7.4 and 7.5 respectively. Assessment of associated policy responses and links with SDGs are explored in Section 7.6. The chapter concludes with gaps in knowledge (Section 7.7) and frequently asked questions. | Historical and Current Trends in GHG Emission and Removals; Their Uncertainties and Implications for Assessing Collective Climate Progress: The biosphere on land and in wetlands is a source and sink of CO 2 and CH 4 , and a source of N 2 O due to both natural and anthropogenic processes that happen simultaneously and are therefore difficult to disentangle 
A range of methodological approaches and data have been applied to estimating AFOLU emissions and removals, each developed for their own purposes, with estimates varying accordingly. Since the SRCCL  | Total Net GHG Flux from AFOLU: National greenhouse gas inventory (NGHGI) reporting following the IPCC 1996 guidelines

Comparisons with other estimates are discussed in 7.2.2. Based on NGHGIs and FAOSTAT, the range is 0 to 0.8 GtCO 2 yr -1 . c CH 4 and N 2 O emission estimates and assessed uncertainty of 30 and 60% respectively, are based on Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) data 
f The NGHGIs take a different approach to calculating 'anthropogenic' CO 2 fluxes than the models (Section 7.2.2). In particular the sinks due to environmental change (indirect anthropogenic fluxes) on managed lands are generally treated as anthropogenic in NGHGIs and non-anthropogenic in models such as bookkeeping and IAMs. A reconciliation of the results between IAMs and NGHGIs is presented in Cross-Chapter Box 6 in this chapter. If applied to this table, it would transfer approximately -5.5 GtCO 2 yr -1 (a sink) from Column E (which would become -7.0 GtCO 2 yr -1 ) to Column A (which would then be 0.4 GtCO 2 yr -1 ). approaches that incorporate different assumptions are used (Section 7.2.2.2). While there is low agreement in the trend of global AFOLU CO 2 emissions over the past few decades (Section 7.2.2), they have remained relatively constant (medium confidence) (Chapter 2). Average non-CO 2 emission (aggregated using GWP100 IPCC AR6 values) from agriculture have risen from 5.2 ¬± 1.4 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 for the period 1990 to 1999, to 6.0 ¬± 1.7 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 for the period 2010 to 2019 
To present a fuller understanding of land-atmosphere interactions, Table 
and atmospheric observations concur that, when combining both anthropogenic (AFOLU) and natural processes on the entire land surface (the total 'land-atmosphere flux'), the land was a global net sink for CO 2 of -6.6 ¬± 4.6 GtCO 2 yr -1 with a range for 2010 to 2019 from -4.4 to -8.4 GtCO 2 yr -1 .  | 7.2.2: Flux of CO 2 from AFOLU, and the Non-anthropogenic Land Sink
Comparison of estimates of the global net AFOLU flux of CO 2 from diverse approaches (Figure 
Yellow line: Net flux estimate from National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (NGHGI) based on country reports to the UNFCCC for LULUCF 
Regionally (Figure 
The FAOSTAT approach is conceptually similar to NGHGIs. FAOSTAT data on forests are based on country reports to FAO-FRA 2020 (FAO 2020a), and include changes in biomass carbon stock in 'forest land' and 'net forest conversions' in five-year intervals. 'Forest land' may include unmanaged natural forest, leading to possible overall overestimation of anthropogenic fluxes for both sources and sinks, though emissions from deforestation are likely underestimated 
Further, the DGVMs and bookkeeping models do not include a wide range of practices which are implicitly covered by the inventories; for example: forest dynamics 
Increasingly, higher emissions estimates are expected from DGVMs compared to bookkeeping models, because DGVMs include a loss of additional sink capacity of 3.3 ¬± 1.1 GtCO 2 yr -1 on average over 2009-2018, which is increasing with larger climate and CO 2 impacts 
Carbon emissions from peat burning have been estimated based on the Global Fire Emission Database (GFED4s; van der Werf et al. 2017). These were included in the bookkeeping model estimates and added 2.0 GtC over 1960-2019 (e.g., causing the peak in South-East Asia in 1998) (Figure 
Remote-sensing products provide valuable spatial and temporal land-use and biomass data globally (including in remote areas), at potentially high spatial and temporal resolutions, that can be used to calculate CO 2 fluxes, but have mostly been applied only to forests at the global or even regional scale. While such data can strongly support monitoring reporting and verification, estimates of forest carbon fluxes directly from Earth Observation (EO) data vary considerably in both their magnitude and sign (i.e., whether forests are a net source or sink of carbon can in part be explained by spatial resolution of the datasets, the definition of 'forest' and the inclusion of processes and methods used to determine degradation and growth in intact and secondary forests, or the changes in algorithm over time 
Remote sensing products can help to attribute changes to anthropogenic activity or natural inter-annual climate variability 
Since changing the NGHGIs' approach is impractical, an interim method to translate and adjust the output of global models was outlined for reconciling a bookkeeping model and NGHGIs  | Cross-Chapter: In fact, there is about 5.5 GtCO 2 yr -1 difference during 2005-2015 between global anthropogenic land CO 2 net flux estimates of IAMs and aggregated NGHGIs, due to different conceptual approaches to what is 'anthropogenic'. This approach and its implications when comparing climate targets with global mitigation pathways are illustrated in this Box Figure 
By adjusting the original IAM output (Cross-Chapter Box 6, Figure 
Cross-Chapter Box 6 (continued)
The UNEP's annual assessment of the global 2030 'emission gap' between aggregated country NDCs and specific target mitigation pathways (UNEP 2020), is only affected to a limited degree. This is because some estimates of global emissions under the NDCs already use the same land-use definitions as the IAM mitigation pathways 
The approach to deriving a NGHGI-comparable emission pathways presented here can be further refined with improved estimates of the future forest sink. Its use would enable a more accurate assessment of the collective progress achieved and of mitigation pledges under the Paris Agreement. LULUCF -where no adjustment is needed -and the NGHGI-comparable CO 2 pathways for LULUCF 
The SRCCL reported with medium evidence and high agreement that ruminants and rice production were the most important contributors to overall growth trends in atmospheric CH 4 
The SRCCL also noted a trend of increasing with the average share from agriculture remaining approximately the same (96%). Agricultural soils were identified in the SRCCL and in recent literature as a dominant emission source, notably due to nitrogen fertiliser and manure applications to croplands, and manure production and deposition on pastures 
Aggregation of CH 4 and N 2 O to CO 2 equivalence (using GWP100 IPCC AR6 values), suggests that AFOLU emissions increased by 15% between 1990 and 2019, though emissions showed trend variability year to year. Agriculture accounted for 91% of AFOLU emissions on average over the period 
In agreement with AR5 
The SRCCL provided limited discussion on regional variation in agricultural N 2 O emissions but reported with medium confidence that certain regions (North America, Europe, East and South Asia) were notable sources of grazing land N 2 O emissions  | Biophysical Effects and Short-lived Climate Forcers: Despite new literature, general conclusions from the SRCCL and WGI-AR6 on biophysical effects and short-lived climate forcers remain the same. Changes in land conditions from land cover change or land management jointly affect water, energy, and aerosol fluxes (biophysical fluxes) as well as GHG fluxes (biogeochemical fluxes) exchanged between the land and atmosphere (high agreement, robust evidence) 
Studies of biophysical effects have increased since AR5 reaching high agreement for the effects of changes in land condition on surface albedo  | Drivers: Since   | Anthropogenic Direct Drivers: Deforestation, Conversion of Other Ecosystems, and Land Degradation: The global forest area in 2020 is estimated at 4.1 billion ha, representing 31% of the total land area (FAO 2020a). Most forests are situated in the tropics (45%), followed by boreal (27%), temperate (16%) and subtropical (11%) domains. Considering regional distribution of global forest area, Europe and the Russian Federation accounts for 25%, followed by South America (21%), North and Central America (19%), Africa (16%), Asia (15%) and Oceania (5%). However, a significant share (54%) of the world's forest area concerns five countries -The Russian Federation, Brazil, Canada, the USA and China (FAO 2020a For each category of explanatory variables (left-hand side), the meta-analysis determined whether the driver variables in that category were consistently associated with higher rates of deforestation, lower rates of deforestation, or neither (not consistent). For example, a ratio of -4x indicates that a variable is associated with less deforestation four times as often as it is associated with more deforestation. Globally, the area of the more open, other wooded land is also of significant importance, with almost 1 billion hectares (FAO 2020a). The area of other wooded land decreased by  | Conversion of Natural Ecosystems to Agriculture: Previous IPCC reports identify land-use change as an important driver of emissions and agriculture as a key driver of land-use change, causing both deforestation and wetland drainage (P.  | Infrastructure Development and Urbanisation: Although built-up areas (defined as cities, towns, villages and human infrastructure) occupy a relatively small fraction of land (around 1% of global land), since 1975 urban clusters (i.e., urban centres as well as surrounding suburbs) have expanded approximately 2.5 times (UNEP 2019; Chapter 8, this report). Regional differences are striking. Between 1975 and 2015, built-up areas doubled in size in Europe while urban population remained relatively constant. In Africa builtup areas grew approximately fourfold, while urban population tripled (UNEP 2019). Trends indicate that rural-to-urban migration will continue and accelerate in developing countries increasing environmental pressure in spite of measures to mitigate some of the impacts (e.g., by preserving or enhancing natural systems within cities, for example, lakes or natural and urban green infrastructures (UNEP 2019). If current population densities within cities remain stable, the extent of built-up areas in developed countries is expected to increase by 30% and triple in developing countries between 2000 and 2050 
Urban expansion leads to landscape fragmentation and urban sprawl with effects on forest resources and land use  | Box 7.1 | Case Study: Reducing the Impacts of Roads on Deforestation Summary: Rapidly expanding roads, particularly in tropical regions, are linked to forest loss, degradation, and fragmentation because the land becomes more generally accessible. Increase of land values of areas adjacent to roads also drives speculation and deforestation related to land tenure  | Background: Although the number and extent of protected areas has increased markedly in recent decades  | Case description: From 2010 to 2050, the total length of paved roads is projected to increase by 25 million km  | Interactions and limitations: More than any other proximate factor, the dramatic expansion of roads is determining the pace and patterns of habitat disruption and its impacts on biodiversity  | Lessons: The large-scale, proactive land-use planning is an option for managing the development of modern infrastructure. Approaches such as the 'Global Roadmap' scheme  | Extractive Industry Development: The extent and scale of mining is growing due to increased global demand (UNEP 2019). Due to declining ore grades, more ore needs to be processed to meet demand, with extensive use of open cast mining. A low-carbon future may be more mineral intensive with, for example, clean energy technologies requiring greater inputs in comparison to fossil-fuel-based technologies 
Mining is also an important driver of deforestation in African and Asian countries. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the secondlargest area of tropical forest in the world occurs, mining-related deforestation exacerbated by violent conflict  | Fire Regime Changes: Wildland fires account for approximately 70% of the global biomass burned annually (van der 
About 98 Mha of forest and savannahs are estimated to have been affected by fire in 2015  | Logging and Fuelwood Harvest: The area of forest designated for production has been relatively stable since 1990. Considering forest uses, about 30% (1.2 billion ha) of all forests is used primarily for production (wood and non-wood forest products), about 10% (424 Mha) is designated for biodiversity conservation, 398 Mha for the protection of soil and water, and 186 Mha is allocated for social services (recreation, tourism, education research and the conservation of cultural and spiritual sites) 
Over-extraction of wood for timber and fuelwood is identified as an important driver of mangrove deforestation and degradation  | Anthropogenic Direct:  | Indirect Drivers: The indirect drivers behind how humans both use and impact natural resources are outlined in Table  | Demography: Global and regional trends in population growth: There was a 43% increase in global population between 1990 and 2018. The greatest growth was observed in Africa and the Middle East (+104%) and least growth in Eastern Europe and West-Central Asia (+7%) (FAO 2019b). | Global and regional projections:: Population is projected to increase by 28% between 2018 and 2050 reaching 9.7 billion 
Human migration: Growing mobility and population are linked to human migration, a powerful driver of changes in land and resource use patterns at decadal time scales, with the dominant flow of people being from rural areas to urban settlements over the past few decades, notably in the developing world  | Economic development and cultural factors: Changes in land use and management come from individual and social responses to economic opportunities (e.g., demand for a particular commodity or improved market access), mediated by institutions and policies (e.g., agricultural subsidies and low-interest credit or government-led infrastructure projects) 
Projections on consumption: If the future global population adopts a per capita consumption rate similar to that of the developed world, the global capacity to provide land-based resources will be exceeded 
Global trade: Market distorting agricultural subsidies and globalisation increases pressure on land systems and functions, with global trade and capital flow influencing land use, notably in developing countries  | Science and technology: Technological factors operates in conjunction with economic drivers of land use and management, whether through intensified farming techniques and biotechnology, high-input approaches to rehabilitating degraded land (e.g., 
Changes in farming and forestry systems: Changes can have both positive and negative impacts regarding multiple factors, including GHG emission trends. Fast advancing technologies shape production and consumption, and drive land-use patterns and terrestrial ecosystems at various scales. Innovation is expected to help drive increases in global crop production during the next decade (OECD/FAO 2019). For example, emerging gene editing technologies, may advance crop breeding capabilities, though are subject to biosafety, public acceptance and regulatory approval 
Research and development are central to forest restoration strategies that have become increasingly important around the world as costs vary depending on methods used, from natural regeneration with native tree species to active restoration using site preparation and planting 
Emerging mitigation technologies: Chemically synthesised methanogen inhibitors for ruminants are expected to be commercially available in some countries within the next two years and have considerable CH 4 mitigation potential  | Institutions and governance: Institutional factors often moderate the relevance and impact of changes in economic and demographic variables related to resource exploitation and use. Institutions encompass the rule of law, legal frameworks and other social structures (e.g., civil society networks and movements) determining land management (e.g., formal and informal property rights, regimes and their enforcement); information and knowledge exchange systems; local and traditional knowledge and practice systems 
Land rights: Land tenure often allows communities to exercise traditional governance based on traditional ecological knowledge, devolved and dynamic access rights, judicious use, equitable distribution of benefits 
Agreements and Finance: Since AR5, global agreements were reached on climate change, sustainable development goals, and the mobilisation of finance for development and climate action. Several countries adopted policies and commitments to restore degraded land 
Companies have also made pledges to reduce impacts on forests and on the rights of local communities as well as eliminating deforestation from their supply chains. The finance sector, a crucial driver behind action (Section 7.6, Box 7.12), has also started to make explicit commitments to avoiding environmental damage  | Assessment of AFOLU Mitigation Measures Including Tradeoffs and Synergies: AFOLU mitigation or land-based climate change mitigation (used in this chapter interchangeably) are a variety of land management or demand management practices that reduce GHG emissions and/or enhance carbon sequestration within the land system (i.e., in forests, wetlands, grasslands, croplands and pasturelands). If implemented with benefits to human well-being and biodiversity, land-based mitigation measures are often referred to as nature-based solutions and/or natural climate solutions (Glossary). Measures that result in a net removal of GHGs from the atmosphere and storage in either living or dead organic material, or in geological stores, are known as CDR, and in previous IPCC reports were sometimes referred to as greenhouse gas removal (GGR) or negative emissions technologies (NETs)

Measures are categorised as supply-side activities in: (i) forests and other ecosystems (Section 7.4.2); (ii) agriculture (Section 7.4.3); (iii) bioenergy and other land-based energy technologies (Section 7.4.4); as well as (iv) demand-side activities (Section 7.4.5 and Figure  | 7.4.1: Introduction Two main approaches to estimating mitigation potentials include: (i) studies on individual measures and/or sectors -henceforth referred to as sectoral assessments, and (ii) integrated assessment models (IAM). Sectoral assessments include studies focusing on one activity (e.g., agroforestry) based on spatial and biophysical data, as well as econometric and optimisation models for a sector, for example, the forest or agriculture sector, and therefore cover a large suite of practices and activities while representing a broad body of literature. Sectoral assessments, however, rarely capture cross-sector interactions or impacts, making it difficult to completely account for land competition, trade-offs, and double counting when aggregating sectoral estimates across different studies and methods 
For the 20 land-based mitigation measures outlined in this section, the mitigation potential estimates are largely derived from sectoral approaches, and where data is available, are compared to IAM estimates. Integrated assessment models and the emissions trajectories, cost-effectiveness and trade-offs of various mitigation pathways are detailed in Section 7.5. It should be noted that the underlying literature for sectoral as well as IAM mitigation estimates consider GWP100 IPCC AR5 values (CH 4 = 28, N 2 O = 265) as well as GWP100 IPCC AR4 values (CH 4 = 25, N 2 O = 298) to convert CH 4 and N 2 O to CO 2 -eq. Where possible, we note the various GWP100
values (in IAM estimates, and the wetlands and agriculture sections), however in some instances, the varying GWP100 values used across studies prevents description of non-CO 2 gases in native units as well as conversion to AR6 GWP100 (CH 4 = 27, N 2 O = 273) CO 2 -eq values to aggregate sectoral assessment estimates. | Co-benefits and Risks: Land interventions have interlinked implications for climate mitigation, adaptation, food security, biodiversity, ecosystem services, and other environmental and societal challenges (Section 7.6.5). Therefore, it is important to consider the net effect of mitigation measures for achieving both climate and non-climate goals (Section 7.1).
While it is helpful to assess the general benefits, risks and opportunities possible for land-based mitigation measures (L.G. 
Overall, measures in the AFOLU sector are uniquely positioned to deliver substantial co-benefits. However, the negative consequences of inappropriate or misguided design and implementation of measures may be considerable, potentially impacting for example, mitigation permanence, longevity, and leakage, biodiversity, wider ecosystem functioning, livelihoods, food security and human wellbeing (Section 7.6) (AR6 WGII, Box 2.2). Land-based mitigation may also face limitations and trade-offs in achieving sustained emission reductions and/or removals due to other land challenges including climate change impacts. It is widely recognised that landuse planning that is context-specific, considers other sustainable development goals, and is adaptable over time can help achieve land-based mitigation that maximises co-benefits, avoids or limits trade-offs, and delivers on international policy goals including the SDGs, Land Degradation Neutrality, and Convention on Biological Diversity (Section 7.6; Chapter 12).
Potential co-benefits and trade-offs are outlined for each of the 20 land-based mitigation measures in the proceeding sub-sections and summarised in Figure  | Overview of Global and Regional Technical and Economic Potentials in AFOLU: IPCC AR5 (2014). In the AR5, the economic mitigation potential of supply-side measures in the AFOLU sector was estimated at 7.18-10.60 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 in 2030 with carbon prices up to USD100 tCO 2 -eq -1 , about a third of which could be achieved at <USD20 tCO 2 -eq -1 (medium evidence, medium agreement)  | IPCC SRCCL (2019).: The SRCCL assessed the full range of technical, economic and sustainability mitigation potentials in AFOLU for the period 2030-2050 and identified reduced deforestation and forest degradation to have greatest potential for reducing supply-side emissions (0.4 to 5.8 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 ) (high confidence) followed by combined agriculture measures, 0.3 to 3.4 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 (medium confidence) 
IPCC AR6. This assessment concludes the likely range of global landbased mitigation potential is approximately 8-14 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 between 2020-2050 with carbon prices up to USD100 tCO 2 -eq -1 , about half of the technical potential (medium evidence, medium agreement). About 30-50% could be achieved <USD20 tCO 2 -eq -1 (Table 
Estimates on costs, feasibility, sustainability, benefits, and risks have also been developed for some mitigation measures, and they continue to be active areas of research. Developing more refined sustainable potentials at a country-level will be an important next step. Although most mitigation estimates still do not consider the impact of future climate change, there are some emerging studies that do 
Across global sectoral studies, the economic mitigation potential (up to USD100 tCO 2 -eq -1 ) of supply-side measures in AFOLU for the period 2020-2050 is 11.4 mean (5.6-19.8 full range) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 , about 50% of the technical potential of 24.2 (4.9-58) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 (Table  | Mitigation option: Estimate type <USD20 tCO 2 -eq -1 | <USD50: tCO 2 -eq -1 <USD100 tCO 2 -eq -1 Technical

Among the mitigation options, the protection, improved management, and restoration of forests and other ecosystems (wetlands, savannas and grasslands) have the largest potential to reduce emissions and/or sequester carbon at 7.3 (3.9-13.1) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 (up to USD100 tCO 2 -eq -1 ), with measures that 'protect' having the single highest total mitigation and mitigation densities (mitigation per area) in AFOLU 
Most mitigation options are available and ready to deploy. Emissions reductions can be unlocked relatively quickly, whereas CDR need upfront investment to generate sequestration over time. The protection of natural ecosystems, carbon sequestration in agriculture, sustainable healthy diets and reduced food waste have especially high co-benefits and cost efficiency. Avoiding the conversion of carbon-rich primary peatlands, coastal wetlands and forests is particularly important as most carbon lost from those ecosystems are irrecoverable through restoration by the 2050 timeline of achieving net zero carbon emissions 
Regionally, economic mitigation potential up to USD100 tCO 2 -eq -1 is estimated to be greatest in tropical countries in Asia and Pacific (34%), Latin America and the Caribbean (24%), and Africa and the Middle East (18%) because of the large potential from reducing deforestation and sequestering carbon in forests and agriculture 
Although economic potentials provide more realistic, near-term climate mitigation compared to technical potentials, they still do not account for feasibility barriers and enabling conditions that vary by region and country. For example, according to most models, including IAMs, avoided deforestation is the cheapest land-based mitigation option (Table 
.11 | Global and regional mitigation potential (GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 ) in 2020-2050 for 20 land-based measures. | Forests and Other Ecosystems:  | Reduce Deforestation and Degradation: Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers. Reducing deforestation and forest degradation conserves existing carbon pools in forest vegetation and soil by avoiding tree cover loss and disturbance. Protecting forests involves controlling the drivers of deforestation (such as commercial and subsistence agriculture, mining, urban expansion) and forest degradation (such as overharvesting including fuelwood collection, poor harvesting practices, overgrazing, pest outbreaks, and extreme wildfires), as well as by establishing well designed, managed and funded protected areas 
Figure 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. Reducing deforestation and forest degradation represents one of the most effective options for climate change mitigation, with technical potential estimated at 0.4-5.8 GtCO 2 yr -1 by 2050 (high confidence) (SRCCL, Chapters 2 and 4, and Table

) and Africa (2.2 GtCO 2 yr -1 technical, 1.2 GtCO 2 yr -1 at USD100 tCO 2 -1 ) 
A major uncertainty in all studies on avoided deforestation potential is their reliance on future reference levels that vary across studies and approaches. If food demand increases in the future, for example, the area of land deforested will likely increase, suggesting more technical potential for avoiding deforestation. Transboundary leakage due to market adjustments could also increase costs or reduce effectiveness of avoiding deforestation (e.g.,  | Critical assessment and conclusion.: Based on studies since AR5, the technical mitigation potential for reducing deforestation and degradation is significant, providing 4.5 (2.3-7) GtCO 2 yr -1 globally by 2050, of which 3.4 (2.3-6.4) GtCO 2 yr -1 is available at below USD100 tCO 2 -1 (medium confidence) (Figure

Improved sustainable forest management of already managed forests can lead to higher forest carbon stocks, better quality of produced wood, continuously produced wood, while maintaining and enhancing the forest carbon stock, and can also partially prevent and counteract the impacts of disturbances 
Generally, measures can consist of one or combination of longer rotations, less intensive harvests, continuous-cover forestry, mixed stands, more adapted species, selected provenances, high quality wood assortments, and so on. Further, there is a trade-off between management in various parts of the forest product value chain, resulting in a wide range of results on the role of managed forests in mitigation 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. In the SRCCL, forest management activities have the potential to mitigate 0.4-2.1 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 by 2050 (medium confidence) (SRCCL: 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). The area of forest under management plans has increased in all regions since 2000 by 233 Mha (FAO 2020e). The roughly 1 billion ha of secondary and degraded forests would be ideal to invest in and develop a sustainable sector that pays attention to biodiversity, wood provision and climate mitigation at the same time. This all depends on the effort made, the development of expertise, know-how in the field, nurseries with adapted provenances, etc as was also found for Russian climate-smart forestry options 
Regional studies can take into account the local situation better: Russia 
. In one production region (British Columbia) a cost-effective portfolio of scenarios was simulated that directed more of the harvested wood to longer-lived wood products, stopped burning of harvest residues and instead produced bioenergy to displace fossil fuel burning, and reduced harvest levels in regions with low disturbance rates. Net GHG emissions were reduced by an average of -9 MtCO 2 -eq yr -1 
In the tropics, estimates of the pantropical climate mitigation potential of natural forest management (a light intensity management in secondary forests), across three tropical regions (Latin America, Africa, Asia), is around 0.66 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 with Asia responding for the largest share followed by Africa and Latin America  | Critical assessment and conclusion.: There is medium confidence that the global technical mitigation potential for improved forest management by 2050 is 1.7 (1-2.1) GtCO 2 yr -1 , and the economic mitigation potential (<USD100 tCO 2 -  | Box 7.2 | Climate-smart Forestry in Europe Summary: European forests have been regarded as prospering and increasing for the last five decades. However, these views also changed recently. Climate change is putting a large pressure on mono species and high stocked areas of Norway spruce in Central Europe  | Background: The idea behind CSF is that it considers the whole value chain from forest to wood products and energy, illustrating that a wide range of measures can be applied to provide positive incentives for more firmly integrating climate objectives into the forest and forest sector framework. CSF is more than just storing carbon in forest ecosystems; it builds upon three main objectives; (i) reducing and/ or removing GHG emissions; (ii) adapting and building diverse forests for forest resilience to climate change; and (iii) sustainably increasing forest productivity and incomes. These three CSF objectives can be achieved by tailoring policy measures and actions to regional circumstances in member states' forest sectors.  | Case description: The 2015 annual mitigation effect of EU-28 forests via contributions to the forest sink, material substitution and energy substitution is estimated at 569 MtCO 2 yr -1 , or 13% of total current EU emissions. With the right set of incentives in place at EU and member states levels, it was found that the EU-28 has the potential to achieve an additional combined mitigation impact through the implementation of CSF of 441 MtCO 2 yr -1 by 2050. Also, with the Green Deal and its biodiversity and forest strategy, more emphasis will be placed on forests, forest management and the provision of renewables. It is the diversity of measures (from strict reserves to more intensively managed systems while adapting the resource) that will determine the success. Only with co-benefits in, for example, nature conservation, soil protection, and provision of renewables, wood for buildings and income, the mitigation and adaptation measures will be successful. ecological reasons  | Interactions, limitations and lessons:  | Critical assessment and conclusion.: There is low confidence that the global technical mitigation potential for grassland and savanna fire management by 2050 is 0.1 (0.09-0.1) GtCO 2 yr -1 , and the economic mitigation potential (<USD100 tCO 2 -1
) is 0.05 (0.03-0.07) GtCO 2 yr -1 . Savanna fires produce significant emissions globally, but prescribed fires in the early dry season could mitigate emissions in different regions, particularly Africa. Evidence is less clear for fire management of forests, with the contribution of GHG mitigation depending on many factors that affect the carbon balance (e.g.,  | Reduce Degradation and Conversion of Grasslands and Savannas: Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers. Grasslands cover approximately 40.5% of the terrestrial area (i.e., 52.5 million km 2 ) divided as 13.8% woody savanna and savanna; 12.7% open and closed shrub; 8.3% nonwoody grassland; and 5.7% is tundra 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. The SRCCL reported a mitigation potential for reduced conversion of grasslands and savannas of 0.03-0.12 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). Unlike most of the measures covered in Section 7.4, there are currently no global, spatially explicit mitigation potential estimates for reduced grassland conversion to generate technical and economic potentials by region. Literature developments since AR5 and SRCCL are studies that provide mitigation estimates in one or a few countries or regions. Modelling experiments comparing Californian forests and grasslands found that grasslands resulted in a more resilient carbon sink than forests to future climate change  | Critical assessment and conclusion.: There is low confidence that the global technical mitigation potential for reduced grassland and savanna conversion by 2050 is 0.2 (0.1-0.4) GtCO 2 yr -1 , and the economic mitigation potential (<USD100 tCO 2 -1
) is 0.04 GtCO 2 yr -1 . Most of the carbon sequestration potential is in below-ground biomass and soil organic matter. However, estimates of potential are still based on few studies and vary according to the levels of soil carbon, and ecosystem productivity (e.g., in response to rainfall distribution). Conservation of grasslands presents significant benefits for desertification control, especially in arid areas (SRCCL, Chapter 3). Policies supporting avoided conversion can help protect at-risk grasslands, reduce GHG emissions, and produce positive outcomes for biodiversity and landowners  | Reduce Degradation and Conversion: of Peatlands Activities, Co-benefits, Risks and Implementation Barriers
Peatlands are carbon-rich wetland ecosystems with organic soil horizons in which soil organic matter concentration exceeds 30% (dry weight) and soil carbon concentrations can exceed 50% (Page and Baird 2016, Boone 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. In the SRCCL (Chapters 2 and 6), it was estimated that avoided peat impacts could deliver 0.45-1.22 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 technical potential by 2030-2050 (medium confidence) 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). Recent studies continue to report high carbon stocks in peatlands and emphasise the vulnerability of peatland carbon after conversion. The carbon stocks of tropical peatlands are among the highest of any forest, 1,211-4,257 tCO 2 -eq ha -1 in the Peruvian Amazon  | Critical assessment and conclusion.: Based on studies to date, there is medium confidence that peatland conservation has a technical potential of 0.86 (0.43-2.02) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 of which 0.48 (0.2-0.68) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 is available at USD100 tCO 2 -1  | Peatland Restoration: Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation barriers. Peatland restoration involves restoring degraded and damaged peatlands, for example through rewetting and revegetation, which both increases carbon accumulation in vegetation and soils and avoids ongoing CO 2 emissions. Peatlands only account for about 3% of the terrestrial surface, predominantly occurring in boreal ecosystems (78%), with a smaller proportion in tropical regions (13%), but may store about 600 GtC or 21% of the global total soil organic carbon stock of about 3000 Gt 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. Large areas (0.51 Mkm 2 ) of global peatlands are degraded of which 0.2 Mkm 2 are tropical peatlands 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). The most recent literature and reviews indicate with high confidence that restoration would decrease CO 2 emissions and with medium confidence that restoration would decrease net GHG emissions from degraded peatlands 
According to recent data, the technical mitigation potential for global peatland restoration is estimated at 0.5-1.3 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 
Climate mitigation effects of peatland rewetting depend on the climate zone and land use. Recent analysis shows the strongest mitigation gains from rewetting drained temperate and boreal peatlands used for agriculture and drained tropical peatlands  | Critical assessment and conclusion.: Based on studies to date, there is medium confidence that peatland restoration has a technical potential of 0.79 (0.49-1.3) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 (median) of which 0.4 (0.2-0.6) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 is available up to USD100 tCO 2 -1
. The large land area of degraded peatlands suggests that significant emissions reductions could occur through large-scale restoration especially in tropical peatlands. There is medium confidence in the large carbon stocks of tropical peat forests (1956-14,757 tCO 2 -eq ha -1 ) and large rates of carbon loss associated with land cover change (640-1650 tCO 2 -eq ha -1 )  | Reduce Conversion of Coastal Wetlands: Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation barriers. Reducing conversion of coastal wetlands, including mangroves, marshes and seagrass ecosystems, avoids emissions from above and below ground biomass and soil carbon through avoided degradation and/or loss. Coastal wetlands occur mainly in estuaries and deltas, areas that are often densely settled, with livelihoods closely linked to coastal ecosystems and resources 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. Coastal wetlands contain high, yet variable, organic carbon stocks, leading to a range of estimates of the global mitigation potential of reduced conversion. The SRCCL (Chapter 2) and SROCC (Chapter 5), report a technical mitigation potential of 0.15-5.35 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 by 2050 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). Global technical mitigation potential for conservation of coastal wetlands from recent literature have focused on protection of mangroves; estimates range from 0.06-2.25 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 
Global estimates show mangroves have the largest per hectare carbon stocks (see IPCC AR6 WGII Box 3.4 for estimates of carbon stocks, burial rates and ecosystem extent for coastal wetland ecosystems). Mean ecosystem carbon stock in mangroves is 3131 tCO 2 -eq ha -1  among the largest carbon stocks on Earth. Recent studies emphasise the variability in total ecosystem carbon stocks for each wetland type, based on species and climatic and edaphic conditions 
Recent loss rates of mangroves are 0.16-0.39% yr -1 and are highest in South-East Asia 
), 10% is in Latin American and the Caribbean (4 MtCO 2 -eq yr -1 ), and approximately 5% in other regions 
Key uncertainties remain in mapping extent and conversion rates for salt marshes and seagrasses  | Critical assessment and conclusion.: There is medium confidence that coastal wetland protection has a technical potential of 0.8 (0.06-5.4) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 of which 0.17 (0.06-0.27) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 is available up to USD100 tCO 2 -1
. There is a high certainty (robust evidence, high agreement) that coastal ecosystems have among the largest carbon stocks of any ecosystem. As these ecosystems provide many important services, reduced conversion of coastal wetlands is a valuable mitigation strategy with numerous co-benefits. However, the vulnerability of coastal wetlands to climatic and other anthropogenic stressors may limit the permanence of climate mitigation. | Coastal Wetland Restoration: Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation barriers. Coastal wetland restoration involves restoring degraded or damaged coastal wetlands including mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass ecosystems, leading to sequestration of 'blue carbon' in wetland vegetation and soil (SRCCL, Chapter 6; SROCC, Chapter 5). Successful approaches to wetland restoration include: (i) passive restoration, the removal of anthropogenic activities that are causing degradation or preventing recovery; and (ii) active restoration, purposeful manipulations to the environment in order to achieve recovery to a naturally functioning system 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. The SRCCL reported that mangrove restoration has the technical potential to mitigate 0.07 GtCO 2 yr -1 through rewetting 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). Recent studies emphasise the time frame needed to achieve the full mitigation potential 
According to recent data, the technical mitigation potential for global coastal wetland restoration is 0.04-0.84 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 
) potential of mangrove restoration; seagrass and marsh restoration was not included due to lack of country-level data on distribution and conversion (but see 
There is high site-specific variation in carbon sequestration rates and uncertainties regarding the response to future climate change  | Critical assessment and conclusion.: There is medium confidence that coastal wetland restoration has a technical potential of 0.3 (0.04-0.84) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 of which 0.1 (0.05-0.2) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 is available up to USD100 tCO 2 -1
. There is high confidence that coastal wetlands, especially mangroves, contain large carbon stocks relative to other ecosystems and medium confidence that restoration will reinstate pre-disturbance carbon sequestration rates. There is low confidence on the response of coastal wetlands to climate change; however, there is high confidence that coastal wetland restoration will provide a suite of valuable co-benefits.

) potential between 2020 and 2050 for croplands to be in Asia and the Pacific (339.7 MtCO 2 yr -1 ) and for grasslands, in Developed Countries (253.6 MtCO 2 yr -1 ).
Critical assessment and conclusion. In conclusion, there is medium confidence that enhanced soil carbon management in croplands has a global technical mitigation potential of 1.9 (0.4-6.8) GtCO 2 yr -1 , and in grasslands of 1.0 (0.2-2.6) GtCO 2 yr -1 , of which, 0.6 (04-0.9) and 0.9 (0.3-1.6) GtCO 2 yr -1 is estimated to be available at up to USD100 tCO 2 -1 respectively. Regionally, soil carbon management in croplands and grasslands is feasible anywhere, but effectiveness can be limited in very dry regions, and for grasslands it is greatest in areas where degradation has occurred (e.g., by overgrazing) and soil organic carbon is depleted. Barriers to implementation include regional capacity for monitoring and verification (especially in developing countries), and more widely through concerns over saturation and permanence. | Biochar: Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers. Biochar is produced by heating organic matter in oxygen-limited environments (pyrolysis and gasification) 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. Biochar is discussed as a mitigation option in AR5 and CDR strategy in the SR1.5. Consideration of potential was limited as biochar is not included in IAMs. The SRCCL estimated mitigation potential of 0.03-6.6 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 by 2050 based on studies with widely varying assumptions, definitions of potential, and scope of mitigation processes included (SRCCL, Chapters 2 and 4: 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). Developments include mechanistic understanding of 'negative priming' and biochar-soil-microbes-plant interactions 
) between 2020 and 2050 to be in Asia and the Pacific (793 MtCO 2 yr -1 ) followed by Developed Countries (447 MtCO 2 yr -1 ) 
Critical assessment and conclusion. Biochar has significant mitigation potential through CDR and emissions reduction, and can also improve soil properties, enhancing productivity and resilience to climate change (medium agreement, robust evidence). There is medium evidence that biochar has a technical potential of 2.6 (0.2-6.6) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 , of which 1.1 (0.3-1.8) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 is available up to USD100 tCO 2 -1 . However, mitigation and agronomic co-benefits depend strongly on biochar properties and the soil to which biochar is applied (strong agreement, robust evidence). While biochar could provide moderate to large mitigation potential, it is not yet included in IAMs, which has restricted comparison and integration with other CDR strategies. | Agroforestry: Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers. Agroforestry is a set of diverse land management systems that integrate trees and shrubs with crops and/or livestock in space and/or time. Agroforestry accumulates carbon in woody vegetation and soil 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. The SRCCL estimated the global technical mitigation potential of agroforestry, with medium confidence, to be between 0.08 and 5.6 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 by 2050 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). Updated estimates of agroforestry's technical mitigation potential and synthesised estimates of carbon sequestration across agroforestry systems have since been published. The most recent global analysis estimates technical potential of 9.4 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 
Regional estimates of mitigation potential are scant with agroforestry options differing significantly by geography 
Recent research has also highlighted co-benefits and more precisely identified implementation barriers. In addition to aforementioned co-benefits, evidence now shows that agroforestry can improve soil health, regarding infiltration and structural stability  | Critical assessment and conclusion.: There is medium confidence that agroforestry has a technical potential of 4.1 (0.3-9.4) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 for the period 2020-2050, of which 0.8 (0.4-1.1) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 is available at USD100 tCO 2 -1
. Despite uncertainty around global estimates due to regional preferences for management systems, suitable land availability, and growing conditions, there is high confidence in agroforestry's mitigation potential at the field scale. With countless options for farmers and land managers to implement agroforestry, there is medium confidence in the feasibility of achieving estimated regional mitigation potential. Appropriately matching agroforestry options, to local biophysical and social contexts is important in maximising mitigation and cobenefits, while avoiding risks (Sinclair and Coe 2019). | Box 7.3 | Case Study: Agroforestry in Brazil -CANOPIES Summary: Brazilian farmers are integrating trees into their croplands in various ways, ranging from simple to highly complex agroforestry systems. While complex systems are more effective in the mitigation of climate change, trade-offs with scalability need to be resolved for agroforestry systems to deliver on their potential. The Brazilian-Dutch CANOPIES project  | Background: The climate change mitigation potential of agroforestry systems is widely recognised  | Case description: These synergies and trade-offs between complexity, multifunctionality and scalability are studied in the CANOPIES (Co-existence of Agriculture and Nature: Optimisation and Planning of Integrated Ecosystem Services) project, a collaboration between Wageningen University (NL), the University of S√£o Paulo and EMBRAPA (both Brazil). Soil and management data are collected on farms of varying complexity to evaluate carbon sequestration and other ecosystem services, economic performance and labour demands. | Interactions and limitations: The trade-off between complexity and labour demand is less pronounced in EMBRAPA's integrated crop-livestock-forestry (ICLF) systems, where grains and pasture are planted between widely spaced tree rows. Here, barriers for implementation relate mostly to livestock and grain farmers' lack of knowledge on forestry management and financing mechanisms 5  | Enteric Fermentation: Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers. Mitigating CH 4 emissions from enteric fermentation can be direct (i.e., targeting ruminal methanogenesis and emissions per animal or unit of feed consumed) or indirect, by increasing production efficiency (i.e., reducing emission intensity per unit of product). Measures can be classified as those relating to (i) feeding, (ii) supplements, additives and vaccines, and (iii) livestock breeding and wider husbandry 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. The AR5 indicated medium (5-15%) technical mitigation potential from both feeding and breeding related measures 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). Recent reviews generally identify the same measures as those outlined in the SRCCL, with the addition of early life manipulation of the ruminal biome 
Approaches differ regionally, with more focus on direct, technical options in Developed Countries, and improved efficiency in developing countries  | Box 7.3 (continued):  | Lessons: Successful examples of how more complex agroforestry can be upscaled do exist in Brazil. For example, on farm trials and consistent investments over several years have enabled Rizoma Agro to develop a citrus production system that integrates commercial and native trees in a large-scale multi-layered agroforestry system. The success of their transition resulted in part from their corporate structure that allowed them to tap into the certified Green Bonds market (CBI 2020). However, different transition strategies need to be developed for family farmers and their distinct socio-economic conditions.
Critical review and conclusion. Based on studies to date, using a range of IPCC GWP100 values for CH 4 , there is medium confidence that activities to reduce enteric CH 4 emissions have a global technical potential of 0.8 (0.2-1.2) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 , of which 0.2 (0.1-0.3) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 is available up to USD100 tCO 2 -eq -1 (Figure  | Improve Rice Management: Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers. Emissions from rice cultivation mainly concern CH 4 associated with anaerobic conditions, although N 2 O emission also occur via nitrification and denitrification processes. Measures to reduce CH 4 and N 2 O emissions include (i) improved water management (e.g., single drainage and multiple drainage practices), (ii) improved residue management, (iii) improved fertiliser application (e.g., using slow release fertiliser and nutrient specific application), and (iv) soil amendments (including biochar and organic amendments) 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. The AR5 outlined emissions from rice cultivation of 0.49-0.723 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 in 2010 with an average annual growth of 0.4% yr -1 . The SRCCL estimated a global mitigation potential from improved rice cultivation of 0.08-0.87 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 between 2020 and 2050, with the range representing the difference between technical and economic constraints, types of activities included (e.g., improved water management and straw residue management) and GHGs considered 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). Since AR5 and the SRCCL, studies on mitigation have principally focused on water and nutrient management practices with the aim of improving overall sustainability as well as measurements of site-specific emissions to help improve the resolution of regional estimates. Intensity of emissions show considerable spatial and temporal variation, dependent on site specific factors including degradation of soil organic matter, management of water levels in the field, the types and amount of fertilisers applied, rice variety and local cultivation practices. Variation in CH 4 emissions have been found to range from 0.5-41.8 mg m 2 hr -1 in South-East Asia 
Recent studies on water management have highlighted the potential to mitigate GHG emissions, while also enhancing water use efficiency  | Critical assessment and conclusion.: There is medium confidence that improved rice management has a technical potential of 0.3 (0.1-0.8) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 between 2020 and 2050, of which 0.2 (0.05-0.3) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 is available up to USD100 tCO 2 -eq -1 (Figure  | Crop Nutrient Management: Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers. Improved crop nutrient management can reduce N 2 O emissions from cropland soils. Practices include optimising fertiliser application delivery, rates and timing, utilising different fertiliser types (i.e., organic manures, composts and synthetic forms), and using slow or controlled-released fertilisers or nitrification inhibitors 
A potential risk under certain circumstances, is yield reduction, while implementation of practices should consider current soil nutrient status. There are significant regional imbalances, with some regions experiencing nutrient surpluses from over fertilisation and others, nutrient shortages and chronic deficiencies (FAO 2021e). Additionally, depending on context, practices may be inaccessible, expensive or require expertise to implement 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. The SRCCL broadly identified the same practices as outlined in AR5 and estimated that improved cropland nutrient management could mitigate between 0.03 and 0.71 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 between 2020 and 2050 (SRCCL Chapter 2) 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). Research since the SRCCL highlights the mitigation potential and co-benefits of adopting improved nutrient management strategies, notably precision fertiliser application methods and nutrient expert systems, and applicability in both large-scale mechanised and small-scale systems (USEPA 2019;  | Critical assessment and conclusion.: There is medium confidence that crop nutrient management has a technical potential of 0.3 (0.06-0.7) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 of which 0.2 (0.05-0.6) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 is available up to USD100 tCO 2 -eq -1 . This value is based on GWP100 using a mixture of IPCC values for N 2 O and may slightly differ if calculated using AR6 values. The development of national roadmaps for sustainable fertiliser (nutrient) management can help in scalingup related practices and in realising this potential. Crop nutrient management measures can contribute not only to mitigation, but food and nutrition security and wider environmental sustainability goals. | Box 7.4 | Case Study: The Climate-smart Village Approach Summary: The climate-smart villages (CSV) approach aims to generate local knowledge, with the involvement of farmers, researchers, practitioners, and governments, on climate change adaptation and mitigation while improving productivity, food security, and farmers' livelihoods  | Background: It is expected that agricultural production systems across the world will change in response to climate change, posing significant challenges to the livelihoods and food security of millions of people  | Case description: The CSV approach seeks an integrated vision so that sustainable rural development is the final goal for rural communities. At the same time, it fosters the understanding of climate change with the implementation of adaptation and mitigation actions, as much as possible. Rural communities and local stakeholders are the leaders of this process, where scientists facilitate their knowledge to be useful for the communities and learn at the same time about challenges but also the capacity those communities have built through time. The portfolio includes weather-smart activities, water-smart practices, seed/breed smart, carbon-/nutrient-smart practices, and institutional-/market-smart activities. | Interactions and limitations: The integration of technologies and services that are suitable for the local conditions resulted in many gains for food security and adaptation and for mitigation where appropriate. It was also shown that, in all regions, there is considerable yield advantage when a portfolio of technologies is used, rather than the isolated use of technologies  | Lessons: i. Understanding the priorities, context, challenges, capacity, and characteristics of the territory and the communities regarding climate, as well as the environmental and socio-economic dimensions, is the first step. Then, understanding climate vulnerability in their agricultural systems based on scientific data but also listening to their experience will set the pathway to identify climatesmart agriculture (CSA) options (practices and technologies) to reduce such vulnerability. ii. Building capacity is also a critical element of the CSV approach, rural families learn about the practices and technologies in a neighbour's house, and as part of the process, families commit to sharing their knowledge with other families, to start a scalingout process within the communities. Understanding the relationship between climate and their crop is key, as well as the use of weather forecasts to plan their agricultural activities.
The assessment of the implementation of the CSA options should be done together with community leaders to understand changes in livelihoods and climate vulnerability. Also, knowledge appropriation by community leaders has led to farmer-to-farmer knowledge exchange within and outside the community (Ortega Fernandez and Mart√≠nez-Bar√≥n 2018). ) of economic potential (up to USD100 tCO 2 -eq -1 ) between 2020-2050, to be in Developed Countries  | Manure Management:  | Introduction: There is robust evidence and high agreement that agriculture needs to change to facilitate environment conservation while maintaining and where appropriate, increase overall production.

Like AE, it is likely that RA can contribute to mitigation, the extent to which is currently unclear and by its case-specific design, will vary (medium confidence).

The SRCCL noted both positive and inconclusive results regarding CA and soil carbon, with sustained sequestration dependent on productivity and residue returns  | Integrated production systems (IPS): The integration of different enterprises in space and time (e.g., diversified cropping, crop and livestock production, agroforestry), therefore facilitating interaction and transfer of recourses between systems, is suggested to enhance sustainability and adaptive capacity  | Organic farming (OF): OF can be considered a form of AE  | Box 7.6 | Case Study: Mitigation Options and Costs in the Indian Agricultural Sector Objective: To assess the technical mitigation potentials of Indian agriculture and costs under a business as usual scenario (BAU) and Mitigation scenario up to 2030  | Results: The study shows that by 2030 under BAU scenario GHG emissions from the agricultural sector in India would be 515 MtCO 2 -eq yr -1 (using GWP100 and IPCC AR4 values) with a technical mitigation potential of 85.5 MtCO 2 -eq yr -1 through the adoption of various mitigation practices. About 80% of the technical mitigation potential could be achieved by adopting cost-saving measures. Three mitigation options, for example, efficient use of fertiliser, zero-tillage, and rice-water management, could deliver more than 50% of the total technical abatement potential. Under the BAU scenario the projected GHG emissions from major crop and livestock species is estimated at 489 MtCO 2 -eq in 2030, whereas under mitigation scenario GHG emissions are estimated at 410 MtCO 2 -eq implying a technical mitigation option of about 78.67 MtCO 2 -eq yr -1 (Box 7.6, Figure 
Sapkota et al. (  | Bioenergy and BECCS: Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers. Bioenergy refers to energy products (solid, liquid and gaseous fuels, electricity, heat) derived from multiple biomass sources including organic waste, harvest residues and by-flows in the agriculture and forestry sectors, and biomass from tree plantations, agroforestry systems, lignocellulosic crops, and conventional food/feed crops. It may reduce net GHG emissions by displacing the use of coal, oil and natural gas with renewable biomass in the production of heat, electricity, and fuels. When combined with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and biochar production, bioenergy systems may provide CDR by durably storing biogenic carbon in geological, terrestrial, or ocean reservoirs, or in products, further contributing to mitigation 
Modern bioenergy systems (as opposed to traditional use of fuelwood and other low-quality cooking and heating fuels) currently provide approximately 30 EJ yr -1 of primary energy, making up 53% of total renewable primary energy supply (IEA 2019). Bioenergy systems are commonly integrated within forest and agriculture systems that produce food, feed, lumber, paper and other bio-based products. They can also be combined with other AFOLU mitigation options: deployment of energy crops, agroforestry and A/R can provide biomass while increasing land carbon stocks 
Bioenergy and BECCS can be associated with a range of co-benefits and adverse side effects 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. Many more stringent mitigation scenarios in AR5 relied heavily on bioenergy and BECCS. The SR1.5 reported a range for the CDR potential of BECCS (2100) at 0.5 to 5 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 when applying constraints reflecting sustainability concerns, at a cost of 100-200 USD tCO 2 -1 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). The role of bioenergy and BECCS in mitigation pathways has been reduced as IAM-based studies have incorporated broader mitigation portfolios and have explored non-CO 2 emissions reduction and a wider variation of underlying assumptions about socio-economic drivers and associated energy and food demand, as well as deployment limits such as land availability for A/R and for cultivation of crops used for bioenergy and BECCS 
Increased availability of spatially explicit data and advances in the modelling of crop productivity and land use, land carbon stocks, hydrology, and ecosystem properties, have enabled more comprehensive analyses of factors that influence the contribution of bioenergy and BECCS in IAM-based mitigation scenarios, and also associated co-benefits and adverse side effects 
Studies have also investigated the extent and possible use of marginal, abandoned, and degraded lands, and approaches to help restore the productive value of these lands  | Box 7.7 | Climate Change Mitigation Value of Bioenergy and BECCS: Besides emissions, and possible avoided emissions, related to the supply chain, the GHG effects of using bioenergy depend on: (i) change in GHG emissions when bioenergy substitutes another energy source; and (ii) how the associated land use and possible landuse change influence the amount of carbon that is stored in vegetation and 
Box 7.7, Figure 
Box 7.7 (continued)
One curve (EMF-33) is determined from stylised scenarios using IAMs 
The Natural Regrowth curve attribute additional 'counterfactual emissions' to the bioenergy system, corresponding to estimated uptake of CO 2 in a counterfactual scenario where land is not used for bioenergy but instead subject to natural vegetation regrowth. This curve does not show actual emissions from the bioenergy system, but it provides insights in the mitigation value of the bioenergy option compared to alternative land-use strategies. To illustrate, if biomass is used instead of a primary energy source with emission factor 75 kgCO 2 GJ -1 , and the median values in the Natural Regrowth curve are adopted, then the curve indicates that up to about 150 EJ of biomass can be produced and used for energy while achieving higher net GHG savings than the alternative to set aside the same land for natural vegetation regrowth (assuming same conversion factor).
The large ranges in the bars signify the importance of uncertainties and how the biomass is deployed. Variation in energy conversion efficiencies and uncertainty about magnitude, timing, and permanence of land carbon storage further complicate the comparison. Finally, not shown in Box 7.7, Figure 
Critical assessment and conclusion. Recent estimates of technical biomass potentials constrained by food security and environmental considerations fall within previous ranges corresponding to medium agreement, (e.g., 
Technical land availability does not imply that dedicated biomass production for bioenergy and BECCS is the most effective use of this land for mitigation. Further, implications of deployment for climate change mitigation and other sustainability criteria are context dependent and influenced by many factors, including rate and total scale. While governance has a critical influence on outcome, larger scale and higher expansion rate generally translates into higher risk for negative outcomes for GHG emissions, biodiversity, food security and a range of other sustainability criteria 
However, literature has also highlighted how the agriculture and forestry sectors may respond to increasing demand by devising management approaches that enable biomass production for energy in conjunction with supply of food, construction timber, and other bio-based products, providing climate change mitigation while enabling multiple co-benefits including for nature conservation 
Strategies to enhance the benefits of bioenergy and BECCS include (i) management practices that protect carbon stocks and the productive and adaptive capacity of lands, as well as their environmental and social functions  | 7.4.5: Demand-side Measures | Shift to Sustainable Healthy Diets: Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers. The term 'sustainable healthy diets' refers to dietary patterns that 'promote all dimensions of individuals' health and wellbeing; have low environmental pressure and impact; are accessible, affordable, safe and equitable; and are culturally acceptable' (FAO and WHO 2019). In addition to climate mitigation gains, a transition towards more plant-based consumption and reduced consumption of animal-based foods, particularly from ruminant animals, could reduce pressure on forests and land used for feed, support the preservation of biodiversity and planetary health 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. According to the AR5, changes in human diets and consumption patterns can reduce emissions 5.3 to 20.2 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 by 2050 from diverted agricultural production and avoided land-use change 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). Since the SRCCL, global studies continue to find high mitigation potential from reducing animal-source foods and increasing proportions of plant-rich foods in diets. 
Regionally, mitigation potentials for shifting towards sustainable healthy diets (50% convergence to <60g of meat-based protein, only accounting for diverted production) vary across regions. A recent assessment finds greatest economic (up to USD100 tCO 2 -  | Critical assessment and conclusion. Shifting to sustainable healthy diets has large potential to achieve global GHG mitigation targets as well as public health and environmental benefits (high confidence).: Based on studies to date, there is medium confidence that shifting toward sustainable healthy diets has a technical potential including savings in the full value chain of 3.6 (0.3-8.0) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 of which 2.5 (1.5-3.9) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 is considered plausible based on a range of GWP100 values for CH 4 and N 2 O. When accounting for diverted agricultural production only, the feasible potential is 1.7 (1-2.7) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 . A shift to more sustainable and healthy diets is generally feasible in many regions (medium confidence). However, potential varies across regions as diets are location-and community-specific, and thus may be influenced by local production practices, technical and financial barriers and associated livelihoods, everyday life and behavioural and cultural norms around food consumption  | Reduce Food Loss and Waste: Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers. Food loss and waste (FLW) refer to the edible parts of plants and animals produced for human consumption that are not ultimately consumed (UNEP 2021b). Food loss occurs through spoilage, spilling or other unintended consequences due to limitations in agricultural infrastructure, storage and packaging 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. In AR5, reduced FLW was considered as a mitigation measure that could substantially lower emissions, with estimated mitigation potential of 0.6-6.0 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 in the food supply chain 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). Since the SRCCL, there have been very few quantitative estimates of the mitigation potential of FLW reductions. Evidence suggests that reducing FLW together with overall food intake could have substantial mitigation potential, equating to an average of 0.3 tCO 2 -eq capita -1 
) for the period 2020-2050 from FLW reduction is estimated to be in  | Critical assessment and conclusion.: There is medium confidence that reduced FLW has large global technical mitigation potential of 2.1 (0.1-5.8) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 including savings in the full value chain and using GWP100 and a range of IPCC values for CH 4 and N 2 O. Potentials at 3.7 (2.2-5.1) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 are considered plausible. When accounting for diverted agricultural production only, the feasible potential is 0.5 (0.0-0.9) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 . See the section above for the joint land-use effects of food related demand-side measures which increases three-fold when accounting for the landuse effects as well. But this would overlap with other measures and is therefore not additive. Regionally, FLW reduction is feasible anywhere but its potential needs to be understood in a wider and changing socio-cultural context that determines nutrition (high confidence). | Improved and Enhanced Use of Wood Products: Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers. The use of wood products refers to the fate of harvested wood for material uses and includes two distinctly different components affecting the carbon cycle, including carbon storage in wood products and material substitution. When harvested wood is used for the manufacture of wood products, carbon remains stored in these products depending on their end use and lifetime. Carbon storage in wood products can be increased through enhancing the inflow of products in use, or effectively reducing the outflow of the products after use. This can be achieved through additional harvest under sustainable management 
The benefits and risks of improved and enhanced improved use of wood products are closely linked to forest management. First of all, the enhanced use of wood products could potentially activate or lead to improved sustainable forest management that can mitigate and adapt 
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. There is strong evidence at the product level that wood products from sustainably managed forests are associated with less greenhouse emissions in their production, use and disposal over their life-time compared to products made from emission-intensive and nonrenewable materials. However, there is still limited understanding of the substitution effects at the level of markets, countries 
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). Since the SRCCL, several studies have examined the mitigation potential of the enhanced and improved use of wood products. A global forest sector modelling study 
The limited availability or absence of estimates of the future mitigation potential of improved use of wood products for many world regions represents an important knowledge gap, especially with regards to material substitution effects. At the product level, wood products are often associated with lower fossil-based emissions from production, use and disposal, compared to products made from emission-intensive and non-renewable materials  | Critical assessment and conclusion.: Based on studies to date, there is strong evidence and medium agreement that the improved use of wood products has a technical potential of 1.0 (0.04-3.7) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 and economic potential of 0.4 (0.3-0.5) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 . There is strong evidence and high agreement at the product level that material substitution provides on average benefits for climate change mitigation as wood products are associated with less fossil-based GHG emissions over their lifetime compared to products made from emission-intensive and non-renewable materials. However, the evidence at the level of markets or countries is uncertain and fairly limited for many parts of the world. There is medium confidence that material substitution and carbon storage in wood products contribute to climate change mitigation when also the carbon balances of forest ecosystems are considered of sustainably managed large areas of forests in medium term. The total future mitigation potential will depend on the forest system considered, the type of wood products that are produced and substituted and the assumed production technologies and conversion efficiencies of these products. | AFOLU Integrated Models and Scenarios: This section assesses the literature and data available on potential future GHG dynamics in the AFOLU sector, the cost-effectiveness of different mitigation measures, and consequences of climate change mitigation pathways on land-use dynamics as well as relevant sustainable development indicators at the regional and global level based on global integrated models.
Land-based mitigation options interact and create various tradeoffs, and thus need to be assessed together as well as with mitigation options in other sectors, and in combination with other sustainability goals 
As a consequence of the relative novelty of land-based mitigation assessment in ILMs and IAMs, the portfolio of land-based mitigation options does not cover the full option space as outlined in Section 7.4. The inclusion and detail of a specific mitigation measure differs across models. Land-based mitigation options are only partially included in ILM and IAM analyses, which mostly rely on afforestation/ reforestation and bioenergy with CCS (BECCS). Most ILM and IAM scenarios are based on the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs)  | Regional GHG Emissions and Land Dynamics: In most of the assessed mitigation pathways, the AFOLU sector is of great importance for climate change mitigation as it (i) turns from a source into a sink of atmospheric CO due to large-scale afforestation and reforestation, (ii) provides high amounts of biomass for bioenergy with or without CCS and (iii), even under improved agricultural management, still causes residual non-CO 2 emissions from agricultural production and (iv) interplays with sustainability dimensions other than climate action 
In most regions, CH 4 and N 2 O emission are both lower in mitigation pathways that limit warming to 3¬∞C (>50%) or lower (C1-C6) compared to scenarios with <4¬∞C 
Figure 
The overall land dynamics in <1.5¬∞C, <2¬∞C and <3¬∞C mitigation pathways are shaped by land-demanding mitigation options such as bioenergy and afforestation, in addition to the demand for other agricultural and forest commodities. Bioenergy production and afforestation take place largely in the (partly) tropical regions ASIA, LAM and AFRICA, but also in OECD90+EU. Land for dedicated second generation bioenergy crops and afforestation displace agricultural land for food production (cropland and pasture) and other natural land. For instance, in the <1.5¬∞C mitigation pathway in ASIA, bioenergy and forest area together increased by about 2.1 million km 2 between 2020 and 2100, mostly at the cost of cropland and pasture (median values). Such large-scale transformations of land use have repercussions on biogeochemical cycles (e.g., fertiliser and water) but also on the economy (e.g., food prices) and potential sociopolitical conditions. | Marginal Abatement Costs According to Integrated Assessments: In this section, Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) results from the AR6 database are used to derive marginal abatement costs which indicate the economic mitigation potential for the different gases (N 2 O, CH 4 , CO 2 ) related to the AFOLU sector, at the global level and at the level of five world regions. This review provides a complementary view on the economic mitigation potentials estimated in Section 7.4 by implicitly taking into account the interlinkages between the landbased mitigation options themselves as well as the interlinkages with mitigation options in the other sectors such as BECCS. The review systematically evaluates a range of possible economic potential estimates across gases, time, and carbon prices.
For different models and scenarios from the AR6 database, the amount of mitigated emissions is presented together with the respective carbon price (Figure 
potentials, scenarios are compared to a benchmark scenario which usually assumes business-as-usual trends and no explicit additional mitigation efforts. Scenarios have been excluded, if they do not have an associated benchmark scenario or fail the vetting according to the AR6 scenario database, or if they do not report carbon prices and CO 2 emissions from AFOLU. Scenarios with contradicting assumptions (for example, fixing some of the emissions to baseline levels) are excluded. Furthermore, only scenarios with consistent 3 regional and global level results are considered. Mitigation potentials are computed by subtracting scenario specific emissions and sequestration amounts from their respective benchmark scenario values. This difference CO 2 (in CO 2 -eq yr -1 ) CH 4 (in CO 2 -eq yr -1 ) N 2 O (in CO 2 -eq yr -1 )
Figure 
accounts for the mitigation that can be credited to the carbon price which is applied in a scenario. A few benchmark scenarios, however, apply already low carbon prices. For consistency reasons, a carbon price that is applied in a benchmark scenario is subtracted from the respective scenario specific carbon price. This may generate a bias because low carbon prices tend to have a stronger marginal impact on mitigation than high carbon prices. Scenarios with carbon prices which become negative due to the correction are not considered. The analysis considers all scenarios from the AR6 database which pass the criteria and should be considered as an ensemble of opportunity 
This approach is close to integrated assessment marginal abatement cost curves (MACCs) as described in the literature 
Hereby, some sequestration efforts can occur in other sectors, while leading to less mitigation in the AFOLU sector. For instance, as an integral part of many scenarios, BECCS deployment will lead to overall emissions reductions, and even provision of CDR as a result of the interplay between three direct components (i) LULUCF emissions/ sinks, (ii) reduction of fossil fuel use/emissions, (iii) carbon capture and sequestration. Since the latter two effects can compensate for the LULUCF effect, BECCS deployment in ambitious stabilisation scenarios may lead to reduced sink/increased emissions in LULUCF 
In the individual cases, the accounting of all these effects is dependent on the respective underlying model and its coverage of inter-relations of different sectors and sub-sectors. The presented potentials cover a wide range of models, and additionally, a wide range of background assumptions on macro-economic, technical, and behavioural developments as well as policies, which the models have been fed with. Subsequently, the range of the resulting marginal abatement costs is relatively wide, showing the full range of expected contributions from land-use sector mitigation and sequestration in applied mitigation pathways.
At the global level, the analysis of the economic mitigation potentials from N 2 O and CH 4 emissions from AFOLU (which mainly can be related to agricultural activities) and CO 2 emissions (which mainly can be related to LULUCF emissions) reveals a relatively good agreement of models and scenarios in terms of ranking between the gases. On the right-hand side panels of Figure 
N 2 O emissions show the smallest economic potential of the three different gases in 2030 as well as in 2050. The mitigation potential increases until a price range of USD150-200 and to a median value of around 0.6 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 mitigation in 2030 and 0.9 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 in 2050, respectively, while afterwards with higher prices the expansion is very limited. Mitigation of CH 4 emissions has a higher potential, also with increasing mitigation potentials until a price range of USD150-200 in both years, with median mitigation of around 1.3 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 in 2030 and around 2.4 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 in 2050, respectively. The highest mitigation potentials are observed for CO 2, but also the highest ranges of observations among the three gases. In 2030, a median of 4 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 mitigation potential is reported for the price range of USD200-250. In 2050, for the carbon price range of between USD100 and USD200, a median of around 4.8 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 can be observed.
When compared with the sectoral estimates from 
Economic CO 2 mitigation potentials from land-use change and forestry are larger compared to potentials from non-CO 2 gases, and at the same time reveal high levels of variation in absolute terms. The 66th percentile in 2050 goes up to 5.2 GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 mitigation, while the lowest observations are even negative, indicating higher CO 2 emissions from land use in scenarios with carbon price compared to scenarios without (counterintuitive dynamics explained below).
Land use is at the centre of the interdependencies with other sectors, including energy. Some models see a strong competition between BECCS deployment with its respective demand for biomass, and CO 2 mitigation/sequestration potentials in the land sector. Biomass demand may lead to an increase in CO 2 emissions from land use despite the application of a carbon price when land-use expansion for dedicated biomass production, such as energy plantations, comes from carbon rich land use/land cover alternatives, or when increased extraction of biomass from existing land uses, such as forest management, leads to reduction of the carbon sink  | Interaction Between Mitigation in the AFOLU Sector and Other SDGs in the Context of Integrated Assessments: Besides the level of biomass supply for bioenergy, the adoption of SDGs may also significantly impact AFOLU emissions and the landuse sector's ability for GHG abatement  | Regional AFOLU Abatement for Different Carbon Prices: At the regional level (Figure 
GHG Mitigation (MtCO 2 -eq yr -1 )
Figure 
The highest potentials from land-related CO 2 emissions, including avoided deforestation as well as afforestation, can be observed in LAM and AFRICA with strong responses of mitigation (indicated by the median value) to carbon prices mainly in the lower range of displayed carbon prices. In general, CO 2 mitigation potentials show a wide range of results in comparison to non-CO 2 mitigation potentials, but mostly also a higher median value. The most extreme ranges are reported for the regions LAM and AFRICA. A medium potential is reported for ASIA and OECD+EU, while REF has the smallest potential according to model submissions. These estimates reflect techno-economic potentials and do not necessarily include feasibility constraints which are discussed in Chapter 7.6. | Illustrative Mitigation Pathways: Different mitigation strategies can achieve the net emission reductions that would be required to follow a pathway limiting global warming, with very different consequences for the land system. Figure 
The scenario ModAct (limit warming to 3¬∞C (>50%), C6) is based on the prolongation of current trends (SSP2) but contains measures to strengthen policies for the implementation of National Determined Contributions (NDCs) in all sectors including AFOLU 
IMP-Neg is similar to ModAct scenario in terms of socio-economic setting (SSP2) but differs strongly in terms of the mitigation target (limit warming to 2¬∞C (>67%), C3) and its strong focus on the supply side of mitigation measures with strong reliance on net-negative emissions. Consequently, all GHG emission reductions as well as afforestation/reforestation and BECCS-based CDR start earlier in time at a higher rate of deployment. However, in contrast to CO 2 emissions, which turn net-negative around 2030 due to afforestation/ reforestation, CH 4 and N 2 O emissions persist throughout the century, similar to ModAct, due to ongoing increasing demand for total calories and animal-based commodities 
In consequence, compared to ModAct scenario, competition for land is increasing and much more other natural land as well as agricultural land (cropland and pasture land) is converted to forest or bioenergy cropland with potentially severe consequences for various sustainability dimensions such as biodiversity 
IMP-Ren is similar to IMP Neg-2.0 in terms of socio-economic setting (SSP2) but differs substantially in terms of mitigation target and mitigation efforts in the energy sector. Even under the more ambitious climate change mitigation target (1.5¬∞C with no or low overshoot (OS), C1), the high share of renewable energy in IMP Ren strongly reduces the need for large-scale land-based CDR, which is reflected in smaller bioenergy and afforestation areas compared to IMP Neg-2.0. However, CH 4 and N 2 O emissions from AFOLU persist throughout the century, similar to ModAct scenario and IMP Neg-2.0.
In contrast to IMPs Neg-2.0 and Ren, IMP SP  | Assessment of Economic, Social and Policy Responses:  | Retrospective in Policy Efforts and Achieved Mitigation Within AFOLU: Since the establishment of the UNFCCC, international agencies, countries, sub-national units and NGO's have developed policies to facilitate and encourage GHG mitigation within AFOLU (Figure 
Early guidance and policies focused on developing GHG inventory methodology with some emphasis on afforestation and reforestation projects, but the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) in the Kyoto Protocol focused attention on emission reduction projects, mostly outside of AFOLU. As successive IPCC AR6 WGIII reports illustrated large potential for AFOLU mitigation, methods to quantify and verify carbon emission reductions emerged within several projects in the early 2000s, through both voluntary (e.g., the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX)) and regulated (e.g., New South Wales and California) markets. The CDM dedicated large attention to LULUCF, including dedicated methodologies and bodies. The reasons for limited uptake of CDM afforestation/reforestation projects were multiple and not limited to the regulatory constraints, but also due to the low abatement potential (poor cost/performance ratio) compared to other mitigation opportunities.
Following COP 13 in Bali, effort shifted to advancing policies to reduce deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) in developing countries. According to 
A new assessment of projects over the last two decades finds emission reductions or offsets of at least 7.9 GtCO 2 -eq (using GWP100 and a mix of IPCC values for CH 4 and N 2 O) over the last 12 years due to agricultural and forestry activities (Table 
The array of activities in accepted protocols or measures and the availability of data to quantify outcomes.
The largest share of emission reductions or carbon offsets in Table 
.
The large number of policy approaches described in Canadian provinces have developed a range of policy options that can include carbon offsets. Quebec has an emissions trading programme that plans to allow forest and agricultural offsets generated within the province to be utilised. Alberta also allows offsets to be utilised by regulated sectors while British Columbia allows offsets to be utilised by the government for its carbon neutrality goals (Government of Alberta, 2021). Over 20 countries and regions have adopted explicit carbon taxes on carbon emission sources and fossil fuels, however, the charges have not been applied to non-CO 2 agricultural emissions (OECD 2021a). California may implement regulations on methane emissions from cattle, however, regulations if approved, will not go into effect until 2024. Institutional and trade-related barriers (e.g., leakage) likely will limit widespread implementation of taxes on emissions in the food sector globally. Many countries exempt purchases of fuels used in agricultural or fishery production from fuel or carbon taxes, thus lowering the effective tax rate imposed on those sectors (OECD 2021a). Furthermore, bioenergy, produced from agricultural products, agricultural waste, and wood is often exempted from explicit carbon taxes. Colombia recently implemented a carbon tax on liquid fuels but allowed domestically produced forestry credits to offset the tax. Colombia also is in the process of developing an emissions trading scheme (OECD 2021a).
REDD+/Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES). PES programmes for a variety of ecosystem services have long been utilised for conservation (e.g., 
A large literature has investigated whether PES programmes have successfully protected habitats. Studies in the USA found limited additionality for programmes that encouraged conservation tillage practices, but stronger additionality for programmes that encouraged set-asides for grasslands or forests 
Evidence from the EU similarly suggests that payments for some agroenvironmental practices may be additional, while others are not 
While expectations that carbon-centred REDD+ would be a simple and efficient mechanism for climate mitigation have not been met 
Empirical evidence that REDD+ funding has slowed deforestation is starting to emerge. 
Agroenvironmental Subsidy Programs/PES. Climate policy for agriculture has developed more slowly than in other sectors due to concerns with food security and livelihoods, political interests, and difficulties in coordinating diffuse and diverse activities and stakeholders (e.g., nutritional health, rural development, and biodiversity conservation) 
Agriculture is one of the most subsidised industries globally, especially in the European Union and the USA. While subsidy payments over the last 20 years have shifted modestly to programmes designed to reduce the environmental impact of the agricultural sector, only 15-20% of the more than USD700 billion spent globally on subsidies are green payments (OECD 2021b). Under the Common Agricultural Policy in the EU, up to 30% of the direct payments to farmers (Pillar 1) have been green payments 
The USA spends USD4 billion yr -1 on conservation programs, or 12% of net farm income (Department of Agriculture 2020). In real terms, this expenditure has remained constant for 15 years, supporting 12 Mha of permanent grass or woodland cover in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), which has increased soil carbon sequestration by 3 tCO 2 ha -1 yr -1 
China has implemented large conservation programmes that have influenced carbon stocks. For example, the Sloping Land Conversion Program, combined with other programs, has increased forest cover and carbon stocks, reduced erosion and increased other ecosystem services in China in recent years  | Regulatory Approaches: Regulations on land use include direct controls on how land is used, zoning, or legally set limits on converting land from one use to another. Since the early 2000s, Brazil has deployed various regulatory measures to slow deforestation, including enforcement of regulations on land-use change in the legal Amazon area. Enforcement of these regulations, among other approaches is credited with encouraging the large-scale reduction in deforestation and associated carbon emissions after 2004 
Many OECD countries have strong legal frameworks that influence agricultural and forest management on both public and private land. Set asides and protected areas have been a widely utilised approach for conservation, and according to (FAO 2020d), 726 Mha (18%) of forests are in protected areas globally. A review of land sparing and land sharing policies in developing countries indicated that most of them follow land sparing models, sometimes in combination with land sharing approaches. However, there is still no clear evidence of which policy provides the best results for ecosystem services provision, conservation, and livelihoods  | Community: Introduction to the case. Forest management and timber harvesting operations began shortly after the Menominee Indian Reservation was created by treaty in 1854. The Menominee reservation sits on about 95,000 ha of land in Wisconsin that spans multiple forest types and is more diverse than adjacent forests. The collectively maintained reservation has 87% of its land under sustained yield forestry.
Case description. The Tribe, in the 19th century, had already mastered vegetation manipulation with fire, sustainable forestry, multiple-use, ecosystem, and adaptive management. The centrepiece of the Tribe's economy has been its forest product industry, Menominee Tribal Enterprises (MTE)  | Interactions and limitations.: In 2013, the Menominee Tribe started a collaboration with the US Forest Service to implement climate adaptation measures. The Tribe actively works to reduce the risk of forest damage and decided to further promote diversity by planting tree seedlings adapted to a warming climate (https://toolkit.climate.gov/case-studies/and-trees-will-last-forever). However, new challenges are related to increasing pressures on forest ecosystems such as non-native insects, pathogens, weed invasions, and the costs for continuous forest inventories to support long-term forest management.
Identified lessons. The elements of sustainability are intertwined with Menominee history, culture, spirituality, and ethics. The balance between the environment, community, and economy for the short term as well as future generations is an example of protecting the entire environment as the Menominee land is a non-fragmented remnant of the prehistoric Lake States forest which has been dramatically reduced all around the reserve  | Voluntary Actions and Agreements: Forest certification programs, such as Forest Sustainability Council (FSC) or Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), are consumer driven, voluntary programmes that influence timber harvesting practices, and may reduce emissions from forest degradation with reduced impact logging and other approaches (medium confidence). Forest certification has expanded globally to over 440 Mha 
Supply chain management in the food sector encourages more widespread use of conservation measures in agriculture (high confidence). The number of private commitments to reduce deforestation from supply chains has greatly increased in recent years, with at least 865 public commitments by 447 producers, processors, traders, manufacturers and retailers as of December, 2020 (New York Declaration on Forests 2021). Industry partnerships with NGOs, such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), have become more widespread and visible in agricultural production. For example, RSPO certifies members all along the supply chain for palm oil and claims around 19% of total production. Similar sustainability efforts exist for many of the world's major agricultural products, including soybeans, rice, sugar cane, and cattle.
There is evidence that the Amazon Soy Moratorium (ASM), an industry-NGO effort whereby large industry consumers agreed voluntarily not to purchase soybeans grown on land deforested after 2006, reduced deforestation in the legal Amazon 
Box 7.9 | Case Study: Deforestation Control in the Brazilian Amazon | Summary: Between 2000 and 2004, deforestation rates in the Brazilian Legal Amazon (is a socio-geographic division containing all nine Brazilian states in the Amazon basin) increased from 18,226 to 27,772 km 2 yr -1 2008 (INPE, 2021). A set of public policies designed in participatory process involving federal government, states, municipalities, and civil society successfully reduced deforestation rates until 2012. However, deforestation rates increased after 2013, and particularly between 2019 and 2020. Successful deforestation control policies are being negatively affected by changes in environmental governance, weak law enforcement, and polarisation of the national politics.
Box 7.9 (Continued) | Background: In 2004, the Brazilian federal government started the Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm) (Ministry of 
The PPCDAm was a benchmark for the articulation of forest conservation policies that included central and state governments, prosecutor offices, and the civil society. The decline in deforestation after 2008 is mostly attributed to these policy options. In 2012, deforestation rates decreased to 4,571 km 2 yr -1 . | Case description: Combating deforestation was a theme in several programs, government plans, and projects not being more restricted to the environmental agenda. This broader inclusion resulted from a long process of insertion and articulation in the government dating back to 2003 while elaborating on the Sustainable Amazon Plan. In May 2003, a historic meeting took place in an Amazonian city, with the president of the Republic, state governors, ministers, and various business leaders, civil institutions, and social movements. It was presented and approved the document entitled 'Sustainable Amazonia -Guidelines and Priorities of the Ministry of Environment for the Sustainable Development of the Amazon Brazilian', containing several guidelines for conservation and sustainable use in the region. At the meeting, the Union and some states signed a Cooperation Agreement aiming to elaborate a plan for the Amazon, to be widely discussed with the various sectors of the regional and national society (Ministerio do Meio Ambiente, MMA, 2013). | Interactions and limitations: The PPCDAm had three main lines of action: (i) territorial management and land use; (ii) command and control; and (iii) promotion of sustainable practices. During the execution of the 1st and 2nd phases of the  | Lessons: The reduction of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon was possible due to effective political and institutional support for environmental conservation. The initiatives of the Action Plan included the expansion of the protected areas network (conservation unities and indigenous lands), improvement of deforestation monitoring to the enforcement of environmental laws, and the use of economic instruments, for example, by cutting off public credit for municipalities with higher deforestation rates 
The array of public policies and social engagement was a historical and legal breakthrough in global protection. However, the broader political and institutional context and actions to reduce the representation and independent control of civil society movements in decision-making bodies weaken this structure with significant increases in deforestation rates, burnings, and forest fires.
7.6.2.4 Mitigation Effectiveness: Additionality, Permanence and Leakage Additionality, permanence and leakage have been widely discussed in the forestry and agricultural mitigation literature 
Typically, carbon registries will require that project developers show additionality by illustrating that the project is not undertaken as a result of a legal requirement, and that the project achieves carbon reductions above and beyond a business as usual. The protocols developed by the California Air Resources Board to ensure permanence and additionality are strong standards and may even limit participation (e.g., 
However, alternative statistical approaches have been deployed in the literature to assess additionality with a quasi-experimental method that rely on developing a counterfactual (e.g., 
The same experimental methods have been applied to analyse additionality of the adoption of soil conservation and nutrient management practices in agriculture.  | Case description: More than 200 million trees have regenerated on more than 5 Mha in the Sahel  | Lessons: A m√©lange of factors contributed to regreening in the Sahel. Increased precipitation, migration, community development, economic volatility and local policy reform have all likely played a role 
Regreening takes place when dormant seed or tree stumps sprout and are cultivated through the technique, called Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR). Without planting new trees, FMNR is presumed to be cheaper than other approaches to restoration, though comparative economic analysis has yet to be conducted 
Regreening in the Sahel and the consequent transformation of the landscape has resulted from the actions of hundreds of thousands of individuals responding to social and biophysical signals 
tillage is rarely additional. 
Permanence focuses on the potential for carbon sequestered in offsets to be released in the future due to natural or anthropogenic disturbances. Most offset registries have strong permanence requirements, although they vary in their specific requirements. The Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) from the Verra programme requires a pool of additional carbon credits that provides a buffer against inadvertent losses. The Climate Action Reserve (CAR) protocol for forests requires carbon to remain on the site for 100 years. The carbon on the site will be verified at pre-determined intervals over the life of the project. If carbon is diminished on a given site, the credits for the site have to be relinquished and the project developer has to use credits from their reserve fund (either other projects or purchased credits) to make up for the loss. Estimates of leakage in forestry projects in AR5 suggest that it can range from 10% to over 90% in the USA 
More recent literature has developed explicit estimates of leakage based on statistical analysis of carbon projects or programs. The literature suggests that there are two economic pathways for leakage (e.g.,  | Assessment of Current Policies and Potential Future Approaches: The Paris Agreement encourages a wide range of policy approaches, including REDD+, sustainable management of forests, joint mitigation and adaptation, and emphasises the importance of non-carbon benefits and equity for sustainable development 
To date, there has been significantly less investment in agricultural projects than forestry projects to reduce net carbon emissions (Table 
Although quantified emission reductions in agricultural projects are limited to date, a number of OECD and economy in transition parties have reduced their net emissions through carbon storage in cropland soils since 2000. These reductions in emissions have typically resulted from policy innovations outside of the climate space, or market trends. For example, in the USA, there has been widespread adoption of conservation tillage in the last 30 years as a labour-saving crop management technique. In Europe, agricultural N 2 O and CH 4 emissions have declined due to reductions in nutrient inputs and cattle numbers 
Numerous developing countries have established policy efforts to abate agricultural emissions or increase carbon storage. Brazil, for instance, developed a subsidy programme in 2010 to promote sustainable development in agriculture, and practices that would reduce GHG emissions. 
Existing policies focused on GHG management in agriculture and forestry is less advanced in Africa than in Latin American and Asia, however, 
The agricultural sector throughout the world is influenced by many policies that affect production practices, crop choices and land use. It is difficult to quantify the effect of these policies on reference level GHG emissions from the sector, as well as the cost estimates presented in Sections 7.4 and 7.5. The presence of significant subsidy programmes intended to improve farmer welfare and rural livelihoods makes it more difficult to implement regulatory programmes aimed at reducing net emissions in agriculture, however, it may increase the potential to implement new subsidy programmes that encourage practices aimed at reducing net emissions (medium confidence). For instance, in the USA, crop insurance can influence both crop choices and land use  | Box 7.11 | Sustainable Intensification Within Agriculture: Evidence and Caveats Introduction: Sustainable intensification (SI) has received considerable attention as a suggested means of pursuing increased overall production, reducing associated environmental externalities, and potentially releasing agricultural land for alternative uses, such as forestry or rewilding  | The extent of sustainable intensification: Total global agricultural land area has remained relatively stable while overall production has increased in recent decades (Section 7.3), indicating that agricultural intensification, as judged by production per unit of land  | Preconditions to ensure sustainable intensification: Increasing the total amount of product produced by improving production efficiency (output per unit of input) does not guarantee SI. It will only be successful if increased production efficiency translates into reduced environmental and social impacts as well as increased production. For example, AR5 highlighted a growing emphasis on reducing GHG emissions per unit of product via increasing production efficiency 
Defined indicators are required. Measurement of SI requires multiple indicators and metrics. It can be assessed at farm, regional or global scales and temporal aspect must be considered. SI may warrant whole system redesign or land reallocation 
If biomass energy production expands and shifts to carbon capture and storage (e.g., BECCS) during the century, there could be a significant increase in the area of crop and forestland used for biomass energy production (Sections 7.4 and 7.5). BECCS is not projected to be widely implemented for several decades, but in the meantime, policy efforts to advance land-based measures including reforestation and restoration activities  | Barriers and Opportunities for AFOLU Mitigation: The AR5 and other assessments have acknowledged many barriers and opportunities to effective implementation of AFOLU measures. Many of these barriers and opportunities focus on the context in developing countries, where a significant portion of the world's cost-effective mitigation exists, but where domestic financing for implementation is likely to be limited. The SSPs capture some of this context, and as a result, IAMs (Section 7.5) exhibit a wide range of land-use outcomes, as well as mitigation potential. Potential mitigation, however, will be influenced by barriers and opportunities that are not considered by IAMs or by bottom-up studies reviewed here. For example, more efficient food production systems, or sustainable intensification within agriculture, and globalised trade could enhance the extent of natural ecosystems leading to lower GHG emissions from the land system and lower food prices 
Impacts may be considered in relative terms (per area or product unit), with relationships potentially antagonistic. Both area-and product unit-based metrics are valid, relevant under different contexts and useful in approaching SI, but do not capture overall impacts and trade-offs  | Avoiding unsustainable intensification: It is critical that intensification does not drive expansion of unsustainable practices. Increased productivity with associated economic reward could incentivise and reward agricultural land expansion, or environmentally and socially damaging practices on existing and former agricultural land 
In conclusion, SI within agriculture is needed given the rising global population and the need to address multiple environmental and social externalities associated with agricultural activities. However, implementation requires strong stakeholder engagement, appropriate regulations, rigorous monitoring and verification and comprehensive outreach and knowledge exchange programmes.
7.6.4.1 Socio-economic Barriers and Opportunities
Design and coverage of financing mechanisms. The lack of resources thus far committed to implementing AFOLU mitigation, income and access to alternative sources of income in rural households that rely on agriculture or forests for their livelihoods remains a considerable barrier to adoption of AFOLU (high confidence). Section 7.6.1 illustrates that to date only USD0.7 billion yr -1 has been spent on AFOLU mitigation, well short of the more than USD400 billion yr -1 that would be needed to achieve the economic potential described in Section 7.4. Despite long-term recognition that AFOLU can play an important role in mitigation, the economic incentives necessary to achieve AFOLU aspirations as part of the Paris Agreement or to maintain temperatures below 2.0¬∞C have not emerged. Without quickly ramping up spending, the lack of funding to implement projects remains a substantial barrier (high confidence).
Investments are critically important in the livestock sector, which has the highest emissions reduction potential among options because actions in the sector influence agriculture specific activities, such as enteric fermentation, as well as deforestation 
Scale and accessibility of financing. The largest share of funding to date has been for REDD+, and many of the commitments to date suggest that there will be significant funding in this area for the foreseeable future. Funding for conservation programmes in OECD countries and China affects carbon, but has been driven
by other objectives such as water quality and species protection.
Considerably less funding has been available for agricultural projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions, and outside of voluntary markets, there do not appear to be large sources of funding emerging either through international organisations, or national programs. In the agricultural sector, funding for carbon must be obtained by redirecting existing resources from non-GHG conservation to GHG measures, or by developing new funding streams  | Risk and uncertainty: Financing needs in AFOLU, and in particular in forestry, include both the direct effects of any changes in activities -costs of planting or managing trees, net revenues from harvesting, costs of thinning, costs of fire management, and so on -as well as the opportunity costs associated with land-use change. Opportunity costs are a critical component of AFOLU finance, and must be included in any estimate of the funds necessary to carry out projects. They are largest, as share of total costs, in forestry because they play a prominent role in achieving high levels of afforestation, avoided deforestation, and improved forest management. In case of increasing soil carbon in croplands through reduced tillage, there are often cost savings associated with increased residues because there is less effort tilling, but the carbon effects per hectare are also modest. There could, however, be small opportunity costs in cases where residues may otherwise be marketed to a biorefinery. The effect of reduced tillage on yields varies considerably across sites and crop types, but tends to enhance yields modestly in the longer-run.
Opportunity costs are a direct financing costs for activities that require land uses to change. For instance a government can encourage planting forests on agricultural land by (a) requiring it, (b) setting up a market or market-based incentives, or (c) buying the land and doing it themselves. In each case, the required investment is the same -the planting cost plus the net foregone returns of agricultural rents -even though a different entity pays the cost. Private entities that pay for carbon credits will also bear the direct costs of planting plus the opportunity costs. In the case of avoided deforestation, opportunity costs similarly must be paid to individual actors to avoid the deforestation. Opportunity for political participation of local stakeholders is barrier in most places where forest ownership rights are not sufficiently documented 
Clear land tenure and land-use rights. Unclear property rights and tenure insecurity undermine the incentives to improve forest and agricultural productivity, lead to food insecurity, undermine REDD+ objectives, discourage adoption of farm conservation practices, discourage tree planting and forest management, and exacerbate conflict between different land users 
Lack of institutional capacity. Institutional complexity, or lack thereof, represents a major challenge when implementing large and complex mitigation programmes (e.g., REDD+) in agriculture, forest and other land uses  | Ecological Barriers and Opportunities: Availability of land and water. Climate mitigation scenarios in the two recent special reports (SR1.5 and SRCCL) that aim to limit global temperature increase to 2¬∞C or less involve carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) removal from the atmosphere. To support large-scale CDR, these scenarios involve significant land-use change, due to afforestation/reforestation, avoided deforestation, and deployment of biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). While a considerable amount of land is certainly available for new forests or new bioenergy crops, that land has current uses that will affect not only the costs, but also the willingness of current users or owners, to shift uses. Regions with private property rights and a history of market-based transactions may be the most feasible for land-use change or land management change to occur. Areas with less secure tenure or a land market with fewer transactions in general will likely face important hurdles that limit the feasibility of implementing novel nature-based solutions.
Implementation of nature-based solution may have local or regionally important consequences for other ecosystem services, some of which may be negative (high confidence). Land-use change has important implications for the hydrological cycle, and the large land-use shifts suggested for BECCS when not carried out in a carefully planned manner, are expected to increase water demands substantially across the globe  | Specific soil conditions, water availability, GHG emissionreduction potential as well as natural variability and resilience.: Recent analysis by 
The effects of climate change on ecosystems, including changes in crop yields, shifts in terrestrial ecosystem productivity, vegetation migration, wildfires, and other disturbances also will affect the potential for AFOLU mitigation. Climate is expected to reduce crop yields, increase crop and livestock prices, and increase pressure on undisturbed forest land for food production creating new barriers and increasing costs for implementation of many nature-based mitigation techniques (medium confidence) (IPCC AR6 WGII Chapter 5).
The observed increase in the terrestrial sink over the past half century can be linked to changes in the global environment, such as increased atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, N deposition, or changes in climate 
Increasing concentrations of CO 2 are expected to increase carbon stocks globally, with the strongest effects in the tropics 
In addition to climate change, 
Adaptation benefits and biodiversity conservation. Biodiversity may improve resilience to climate change impacts as more-diverse systems could be more resilient to climate change impacts, thereby maintaining ecosystem function and preserving biodiversity  | Technological Barriers and Opportunities: Monitoring, reporting, and verification. Development of satellite technologies to assess potential deforestation has grown in recent years with the release of 30 m data by 
Ground-based forest inventory measurements have been developed in many countries, most prominently in the Northern Hemisphere, but more and more countries are starting to develop and collect national forest inventories. Training and capacity building is going on in many developing countries under UNREDD and FAO programmes. Additional efforts to harmonise data collection methods and to make forest inventory data available to the scientific community would improve confidence in forest statistics, and changes in forest statistics over time. To some extent the Global Forest Biodiversity Initiative fills in this data gap (https://gfbi.udl.cat/). | Linkages to Ecosystem Services, Human Wellbeing and Adaptation (including SDGs): The linkage between biodiversity, ecosystem services, human well-being and sustainable development is widely acknowledged (Millenium Ecosystem Assesment 2005; UNEP 2019). Loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services will have an adverse impact on quality of life, human well-being and sustainable development (IPBES 2019a). Such losses will not only affect current economic growth but also impede the capacity for future economic growth.
Population growth, economic development, urbanisation, technology, climate change, global trade and consumption, policy and governance are key drivers of global environmental change over recent decades 
The increasing trend in aquaculture production especially in South and South-East Asia through intensive methods affects existing food production and ecosystems by diverting rice fields or mangroves 
Currently, land degradation is estimated to have reduced productivity in 23% of the global terrestrial area, and between USD235 billion and USD577 billion in annual global crop output is at risk because of pollinator loss (IPBES 2019a). The global trends reviewed above are based on data from 2000 studies. It is not clear whether the assessment included a quality control check of the studies evaluated and suffer from aggregation bias. For instance, a recent metaanalysis of global forest valuation studies noted that many studies reviewed had shortcomings such as failing to clearly mention the methodology and prices used to value the forest ecosystem services, double counting, data errors, and so on 
Land degradation has had a pronounced impact on ecosystem functions worldwide (IPBES 2018e). Net primary productivity of ecosystem biomass and of agriculture is presently lower than it would have been under a natural state on 23% of the global terrestrial area, amounting to a 5% reduction in total global net primary productivity (IPBES 2018e). Over the past two centuries, soil organic carbon, an indicator of soil health, has seen an estimated 8% loss globally (176 GtC) from land conversion and unsustainable land management practices (IPBES 2018e). Projections to 2050 predict further losses of 36 GtC from soils, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. These losses are projected to come from the expansion of agricultural land into natural areas (16 GtC), degradation due to inappropriate land management (11 GtC) and the draining and burning of peatlands (9 GtC) and melting of permafrost (IPBES 2018e). Trends in biodiversity measured by the global living planet index between 1970 to 2016 indicate a 68% decline in monitored population of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and fish (WWF 2020). FAO's recent report on the state of the world's biodiversity for food and agriculture points to an alarming decline in biodiversity for food and agriculture including associated biodiversity such as pollination services, microorganisms which are essential for production systems (FAO 2019d). These suggest that overall ecosystem health is consistently declining with adverse consequences for good quality of life, human well-being, and sustainable development.
Although numerous studies have estimated the value of ecosystem services for different sites, ecosystems, and regions, these studies mostly evaluate ecosystem services at a single point in time 
For instance, a study of climate-smart cocoa production in Ghana shows that due to lack of tenure (tree) rights, bureaucratic and legal hurdles in registering trees in cocoa farms, and other barriers small cocoa producers could not realise the project benefits (Box 7.13).
Experience of CSA in some other sub-Saharan African countries and other countries such as Belize too has been constrained by weak extension systems and policy implementation, and other barriers  | Box 7.13 | Case Study: Climate-smart Cocoa Production in Ghana: Policy objectives i. To promote sustainable intensification of cocoa production and enhance the adaptive capacity of small cocoa producers. ii. To reduce cocoa-induced deforestation and GHG emissions. iii. To improve productivity, incomes, and livelihoods of smallholder cocoa producers. | Policy mix: The climate-smart cocoa (CSC) production programme in Ghana involved distributing shade tree seedlings that can protect cocoa plants from heat and water stress, enhance soil organic matter and water holding capacity of soils, and provide other assistance with agroforestry, giving access to extension services such as agronomic information and agrochemical inputs. The shade tree seedlings were distributed by NGOs, government extension agencies, and the private sector free of charge or at subsidised prices and was expected to reduce pressure on forests for growing cocoa plants. The CSC programme was mainly targeted at small farmers who constitute about 80% of total farm holdings in Ghana. Although the government extension agency (Cocobod) undertook mass spraying or pruning of cocoa farms they found it difficult to access the 800,000 cocoa smallholders spread across the tropical south of the country. The project brought all stakeholders together, in other words, the government, private sector, local farmers and civil society or NGOs to facilitate the sustainable intensification of cocoa production in Ghana. Creation of a community-based governance structure was expected to promote benefit sharing, forest conservation, adaptation to climate change, and enhanced livelihood opportunities.
7.6.5.2 Human Well-being and Sustainable Development Goals
Conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services is part of the larger objective of building climate resilience and promoting good quality of life, human well-being and sustainable development.
While two of the 17 SDGs directly relate to nature (SDGs 14 and 15 covering marine and terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity), most other SDGs relating to poverty, hunger, inequality, health and wellbeing, clean sanitation and water, energy, and so on, are directly or indirectly linked to nature 
Current negative trends in biodiversity and ecosystem services will undermine progress towards achieving 80% (35 out of 44) of the assessed targets of SDGs related to poverty, hunger, health, water, cities, climate, oceans and land (IPBES 2019a). However, 
Progress in achieving the 20 Aichi Biodiversity targets which are critical for realising the SDGs has been poor with most of the targets not being achieved or only partially realised (SCBD 2020). There could be synergies and trade-offs between ecosystem services and human well-being. For instance, a study notes that although policy interventions and incentives to enhance supply of provisioning services (e.g., agricultural production) have led to higher GDP, it may have an adverse effect on the regulatory services of ecosystems 
Box 7.13 (continued) | Governance context:  | Critical enablers: The role assigned to local government mechanisms such as Ghana's Community Resource Management Area Mechanisms (CREMAs) was expected to give a voice to smallholders who are an important stakeholder in Ghana's cocoa sector. CREMAs are inclusive because authority and ownership of natural resources are devolved to local communities who can thus have a voice in influencing CSC policy thereby ensuring equity and adapting CSC to local contexts. However, ensuring the long-term sustainability of CREMAs will help to make them a reliable mechanism for farmers to voice their concerns and aspirations, and ensure their independence as a legitimate governance structure in the long run. The private sector was assigned an important role to popularise climate-smart cocoa production in Ghana. However, whether this will work to the advantage of smallholder cocoa producers needs to be seen. | Critical barriers: The policy intervention overlooks the institutional constraints characteristic of the cocoa sector in Ghana where small farmers are dominant and have skewed access to resources and markets. Lack of secure tenure (tree rights) where the ownership of shade trees and timber vests with the state, bureaucratic and legal hurdles to register trees in their cocoa farms are major constraints that impede realisation of the expected benefits of the CSC programme. This is a great disincentive for small cocoa producers to implement CSC initiatives and nurture the shade tree seedlings and undertake land improvement measures. The state marketing board has the monopoly in buying and marketing of cocoa beans including exports which impeded CREMAs or farming communities from directly selling their produce to MNCs and traders. However, many MNCs have been involved in setting up of CREMA or similar structures, extending premium prices and non-monetary benefits (access to credit, shade tree seedlings, agrochemicals) thus indirectly securing their cocoa supply chains. A biased ecological discourse about the benefits of climate-smart agriculture and sustainable intensive narrative, complexities regarding the optimal shade levels for growing cocoa, and dependence on agrochemicals are issues that affect the success and sustainability of the project intervention. Dominance of private sector players especially MNCs in the sector may be detrimental to the interests of smallholder cocoa producers 
7.6.5.3 Land-based Mitigation and Adaptation
Combined mitigation and adaptation approaches have been highlighted throughout Section 7.4 regarding specific measures. Land-based mitigation and adaptation to the risks posed by climate change and extreme weather events can have several co-benefits as well as help promote development and conservation goals.
Land-based mitigation and adaptation will not only help reduce GHG emissions in the AFOLU sector, but measures are required to closely link up with adaptation. In the central 2¬∞C scenario, improved management of land and more efficient forest practices, a reduction in deforestation and an increase in afforestation, would account for 10% of the total mitigation effort over 2015-2050  | Knowledge Gaps: Closing knowledge gaps and narrowing uncertainties are crucial to advance AFOLU mitigation. Knowledge gaps exist across a range of areas, from emissions accounting and mitigation measure development to integration of scientific and traditional knowledge and development and sustainable implementation strategies. The following are identified as priorities:
‚Ä¢ Uncertainty in contemporary emissions and sinks within AFOLU is still high. There is ongoing need to develop and refine emission factors, improve activity data and facilitate knowledge exchange, concerning inventories and accounting. For example, insufficient knowledge on CO 2 emissions relating to forest management and burning or draining of organic soils (wetlands and peatlands), limits certainty on CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes. ‚Ä¢ Improved monitoring of the land CO 2 balance is urgently needed, including impacts of land degradation and restoration efforts (e.g., in tropical and boreal regions), making use of combined remote sensing, artificial intelligence, ground-based and modelling tools 
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) FAQ 7.1 | Why is the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Uses (AFOLU) sector unique when considering GHG mitigation?
There are three principal reasons that make the AFOLU sector unique in terms of mitigation:
In contrast to other sectors, AFOLU can facilitate mitigation in several different ways. Specifically, AFOLU can (i) reduce emissions as a sector in its own right, (ii) remove meaningful quantities of carbon from the atmosphere and relatively cheaply, and (iii) provide raw materials to enable mitigation within other sectors, such as energy, industry or the built environment.
The emissions profile of AFOLU differs from other sectors, with a greater proportion of non-CO 2 gases (N 2 O and CH 4 ). The impacts of mitigation efforts within AFOLU can vary according to which gases are targeted, as a result of the differing atmospheric lifetime of the gases and differing global temperature responses to the accumulation of the specific gases in the atmosphere.
In addition to tackling climate change, AFOLU mitigation measures have capacity, where appropriately implemented, to help address some critical, wider challenges, as well as contributing to climate change adaptation. AFOLU is inextricably linked with some of the most serious challenges that are suggested to have ever faced humanity, such as large-scale biodiversity loss, environmental degradation and the associated consequences. As AFOLU concerns land management and utilises a considerable portion of the Earth's terrestrial area, the sector greatly influences soil, water and air quality, biological and social diversity, the provision of natural habitats, and ecosystem functioning, consequently impacting many SDGs. | FAQ 7.2 | What AFOLU measures have the greatest economic mitigation potential?: Economic mitigation potential refers to the mitigation estimated to be possible at an annual cost of up to USD100 tCO 2 -1 mitigated. This cost is deemed the price at which society is willing to pay for mitigation and is used as a proxy to estimate the proportion of technical mitigation potential that could realistically be implemented. Between 2020 and 2050, measures concerning forests and other ecosystem are estimated to have an average annual mitigation potential of 7.3 (3.9-13.1) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 at USD100 tCO 2 -1 . At the same cost, agricultural measures are estimated to have a potential of 4.1 (1.7-6.7) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 . Emerging technologies, such as CH 4 vaccines and inhibitors, could sustainably increase agricultural mitigation potential in future. The diverted production effects of changes in demand (reduced food losses, diet changes and improved and enhanced wood products use), is estimated to have an economic potential of 2.2 (1.1-3.6) GtCO 2 -eq yr -1 . However, cost forms only one constraint to mitigation, with realisation of economic potential dependent on multiple context-specific environmental and socio-cultural factors. | FAQ 7.3 |: What are potential impacts of large-scale establishment of dedicated bioenergy plantations and crops and why is it so controversial?
The potential of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) remains a focus of debate with several studies evaluating the level at which BECCS could be sustainably implemented, published since AR5. BECCS involves sequestering carbon through plant growth (i.e., in trees or crops) and capturing the carbon generated when this biomass is processed for power or fuel. The captured carbon then requires long-term storage in for example, geological, terrestrial or ocean reservoirs, or in products. While appearing to create a net removal of carbon from the atmosphere, BECCS requires land, water and energy which can create adverse side effects at scale. Controversy has arisen because some of the models calculating the energy mix required to keep the temperature to 1.5¬∞C have included BECCS at very large scales as a means of both providing energy and removing carbon from the atmosphere to offset emissions from industry, power, transport or heat. For example, studies have calculated that for BECCS to achieve 11.5 GtCO 2 -eq per year of carbon removal in 2100, as envisaged in one scenario, 380-700 Mha or 25-46% of all the world's arable and cropland would be needed. In such a situation, competition for agricultural land seriously threatens food production and food security, while also impacting biodiversity, water and soil quality, and landscape aesthetic value. More recently however, the scenarios for BECCS have become much more realistic, though concerns regarding impacts on food security and the environment remain, while the reliability of models is uncertain due to methodological flaws. Improvements to models are required to better capture wider environmental and social impacts of BECCS in order to ascertain its sustainable contribution in emissions pathways. Additionally, the opportunity for other options that could negate very large-scale deployment of BECCS, such as other carbon dioxide removal measures or more stringent emission reductions in other sectors, could be explored within models.","Impact of anthropogenic climate change on wildfire across western US forests (, , 2016) || Seaweed and Seaweed Bioactives for Mitigation of Enteric Methane: Challenges and Opportunities (, 2020) || Evolution of rain and photoperiod limitations on the soybean growing season in Brazil: The rise (and possible fall) of double-cropping systems (, , 2018) || Determination of tropical deforestation rates and related carbon losses from (, 2014. 1990 to 2010) || On-farm anaerobic digestion uptake barriers and required incentives: A case study of the UK East Midlands region (, , 2020) || The LCA4CSA framework: Using life cycle assessment to strengthen environmental sustainability analysis of climate smart agriculture options at farm and crop system levels (, , , 2019) || Which is more important to sorghum production systems in the Sudano-Sahelian zone of West Africa: Climate change or improved management practices?

Surface runoff associated with climate change and land use and land cover in southeast region of Brazil,Leticia Arantes; Ana Claudia; Pereira Carvalho; Ana Paula; Reinaldo Lorandi; Luiz Moschini; Jos√© Augusto; Di Lollo,"The objective of this research was to understand the environmental dynamics of the studied region considering this context and to develop instruments for the best management of water resources, based on Potential Runoff Charts generated from natural and anthropic environment attributes consideration in the years 2001 and 2017. The study area was the Rio Claro Watershed (RCW), which covers 251.91 km 2 and is located in the northwest region of S√£o Paulo State, Brazil. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to define weights of the environmental attributes: steepness; total annual rainfall; land use/cover; soil; landforms; and aquifer units. The charts present the surface runoff in five classes (Very Low, Low, Medium, High, and Very High). The results showed significant changes in the period, due to climate changes, and, secondly, due to land use/cover changes. While in 2001 the Low and Medium Potential classes (59.3%) predominated, in 2017 the Medium and Very Low Potential classes (56.5% total) were the most common. High and Very High Potential classes showed small variations in the two years. Results derivate especially from lower rainfall in 2017 compared to 2001, showing that climate changes does not always mean an increase in rainfall on a regional scale and that water resources management instruments should consider such situations. The proposed measures aim to favor infiltration, reduce erosive processes, and favoring aquifers recharge.","Introduction: Freshwater resources are increasingly scarce, requiring effective water management tools 
According to 
The knowledge of soil cover changes allows to identify its effects on the hydrological processes 
In this context, the integration of climate change and human interference with data from the natural environment allows understanding of the dynamics of the watersheds, allowing the proposition of instruments for local and regional management of water resources.
Given this, the main objective of the article was to elaborate the Surface Runoff Potential Chart for the Rio Claro watershed, based on the weighting of attributes of the natural and anthropic environment, using the map algebra technique based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The product had the purpose of identifying how these attributes interfere with the water behavior of the area. The study area was chosen because it presents records of environmental degradation (floods, changes in water courses and widespread occurrence of erosion processes), resulting in water resources quality problems. | Studied area: The Rio Claro Watershed (RCW) is part of the Water Resources Management Unit 09 of the State of S√£o Paulo ( FEHIDRO -Fundo Estadual de Recursos H√≠dricos, 2011 ), presents an area of 251.91 km 2 and has its location shown in Fig. 
In 55.40% of the area, there are concave medium hills with slopes between 5% and 10%; medium hills cover 15.90% of the area in areas with slopes lower than 5%. The other forms of relief in the area are small convex hills (12.33%), scarps (7.50%), wide open valleys (7.29%), and small closed valleys occupying 1.39% of the area 
According to ( IF -Instituto Florestal do Estado de S√£o Paulo 2010 ), the RCW conserves an important part of the remaining vegetation cover of the Atlantic Forest biome, with semideciduous forests, as well as floodplains and cerrado areas to a lesser extent. In addition to remnants of native vegetation, agricultural activities (sugarcane, coffee, citriculture, forestry), pasture, urbanization and mining were identified.
The soils in the basin have predominantly sandy texture, with the exception of the residual soils of Basic Magmatites and Corumbata√≠ For-   | Materials and methods: The sequence of methodological procedures adopted in this study is shown in Fig. 
The weights definitions for Surface Runoff Potential Charts production was based on AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) method of 
Rainfall data were obtained from the National Institute of Meteorology 
In the map algebra generation from AHP use, the weights of each class of the attributes in the analysis was defined by the AHP eigenvectors, using Reclassify tool of ArcGIS 10.5.1¬Æ. Subsequently, a consistency analysis of the weights adopted for the information plans was carried out, in this way, the Consistency Ratio (RC) and the Consistency Index (CI) were calculated, according to the equations in Table 
The weights adopted through the AHP method for each class of attributes are shown in Table 
The map algebra was developed using Weighted Sum function, and the used weights corresponded to the values of the eigenvectors for each environmental attribute obtained from AHP, as shown in Table 
The weights of the environmental components were defined considering its importance on surface runoff in the watershed. The steepness was the component that received the highest weight since it is a determinant factor in the local surface runoff; rainfall was the second component in importance, since the regional climate is characterized by rainfall concentrated in short periods of the year (four months of summer).
The components soil, landforms, and aquifer systems resulted in lower weights depending on the preferences adopted. The reasons for    The Surface Runoff Potential Charts resultant from natural and natural/anthropic environments of the RCW (years 2001 and 2017) were presented considering five runoff classes (Very Low, Low, Medium, High and Very High). These classes were quantified for each of the five subbasins of the RCW. The sub-basins were individually analyzed in order to verify the expected runoff conditions in these areas so that water management recommendations for each sub-basin could be elaborated. The sub-basins were automatically delimited in the Global Mapper¬Æ software, and their limits were obtained using the Generate Watershed tool, through the drainage network generated from the Digital Elevation Model obtained from the Topodata Project  | Results and discussions: The intermediate results used in Surface Runoff Potential Charts generation, i.e. land use/cover and annual precipitation charts, are showed in Fig. 
Regarding land use/cover, results show sugarcane cultivation and native vegetation as the predominant classes, corresponding to 72.53% (182.70 km 2 ) of the area. Exposed soil in 2001 includes fallow areas, which in the year 2017 were occupied by sugar cane cultivation, citriculture, forestry and pasture, which resulted in a reduction of 77.64% in this class. The urbanized areas of the RCW increased by 48.94% considering the studied period, generating a significant increase in the waterproofed areas in the basin.
Regarding the total annual precipitation, the RCW in 2001 presented values ranging from 1307.89 to 1343.26 mm, however, in 2017 there was a reduction of these levels to 1175.97-1218.45 mm (10% reduction in precipitation). The eastern portion of the RCW presents higher levels  of precipitation, unlike the central-west region towards the mouth of Rio Claro, which present lower levels in both years. In Fig. 
The charts of potential runoff that did not consider the annual total precipitation show few differences for the two years analyzed. However, the charts that consider precipitation for the years 2001 and 2017 show significant changes resulting from precipitation levels in the two years of analysis. The results obtained for each sub-basin of the Rio Claro basin are discussed in the sequence. The choice to present the results by subbasins was due to the differences in results between them and the fact that environmental management strategies could be more effective. | C√≥rrego Passa-Quatro sub-basin (A): In this sub-basin, ""Very Low"" and ""Low"" classes of surface runoff predominates in both years, and rainfall was the determining factor conditioning this classification, due to its lower levels of precipitation when compared to other regions of the RCW. Increases in rainfall in this area, can induces runoff increase and soil erosion 
The lower surface runoff favor the infiltration, contributing to the recharge of the Santa Rita do Passa Quatro and Piramb√≥ia aquifers, with greater territorial extension in the sub-basin, both porous aquifers, which are sooty to soils with sandy texture and thicknesses greater than 10 m, occupied mainly by sugarcane and pasture, in both years considered.
In 2001, ""Medium"" class was mainly located in the urban area, associated with sandy soils, increasing soil erosion potential in extraurban areas. In 2017, this area was classified as ""Low Potential Runoff"", due to lower precipitation values, confirming the relationship of rainfall and surface runoff in this are. According to 
The ""High and Very High"" classes in this basin are associated to larger slopes ( > 20%) and medium-textured and less thick soils. According to  | Ribeir√£o do Sap√© sub-basin (B): The greater variation in the potential for surface runoff in this subbasin between 2001 and 2017 was observed in the ""Medium"" class, with a reduction of 85.31%, with strong ""Low Potential"" growth (43.45%). The class occurs in areas of sugarcane cultivation and the presence of native vegetation, with vegetation cover reducing the surface runoff and increasing infiltration 
In 2017, ""High"" and ""Very High Potential Flow"" classes were identified in regions with high slopes ( > 30%), directing flow to areas with softer slopes with sandy soils and profiles thicker than 10 m. The combination of attributes in this region of flat relief favors the recharge of the aquifer unit (Piramb√≥ia). | Rio Clarinho sub-basin (C): This area shows strong variation from ""Very Low "" and ""Low "" to ""Medium "" and ""High"" classes, mainly due to changes in total annual precipitation and in land use and cover changes. In 2001, total annual rainfall varied from 1314.97 mm to 1322.04 mm in the southwest portion, and between 1322.04 mm and 1329.11 mm in the rest of the sub-basin, while in 2017 the variations were between 1190.13 mm and 1204, 29 mm in the southwest portion, and 1204.29 mm at 1218.45 mm in the rest of the area.
Considering land use and cover, there is a decrease of exposed soil, and increases sugarcane cultivation. Another notable change was the change of sugarcane for pasture in the northern and central portions of the sub-basin. Between 2001 and 2017 there was a native vegetation loss of 30.1%, which also influenced the alteration of the surface runoff classes.
In addition, a small-scale increase of areas with citrus and silviculture in the center and south of the sub-basin in 2017, being the first class influencing the reduction of flow velocity due to planting in corridors 
Runoof is conditioned by slope (10-30%) in the northern portion, associated with fine texture soils with thickness of less than 2 m. In the rest of the sub-basin, the soils have a sandy texture, favoring aquifer units' recharge. | C√≥rrego do Faveiro sub-basin (D): This was the only sub-basins that did not present the ""Very Low"" and ""Low Potential"" classes in 2017. In 2001, these classes occurred mainly in the western portion of the sub-basin, and in 2017 classified as ""Medium "" and ""High"" potential to the outflow.
This change was due mainly from land use and cover changes, such as the reduction of native vegetation as a result of increased agricultural activities (sugarcane, citrus, silviculture, and pasture) and mining. According to 
In the year 2001, the occurrence of ""Medium Potential"" class in the eastern portion (soil with sandy texture and depth above 10 m), contributes to Piramb√≥ia Aquifer recharge. Annual rain fall shows increases from 2001 to 2017 in this area. In both, 2001 and 2017 years, C√≥rrego do Faveiro sub-basin presented a higher percentage of the ""Medium Potential"" class, in areas with coarser soil texture.
The ""High"" and ""Very High"" classes were concentrated in the northeastern and north-western portions in 2001, regions with gradients up  to 30%, sandy soils with thicknesses ranging from 5 to 10 m, or greater than 10 m in areas with forms of relief (planar rectilinear and planar convex) that favor surface runoff. In these conditions, low influence of the uncontaminated materials on the potential flow, and strong control of the relief, the precipitation indices, and the types of soil use and cover are observed  | Rio Claro sub-basin (E): Rio Claro sub-basin presents greater diversity among the environmental attributes. The area shows significant changes in soil cover in the period 2001-2017, influencing surface runoff, such as increased sugar cane cultivation and pasture, in the entire sub-basin; and decrease of exposed soil areas.
In 2001, total annual rainfall increases from west to east strongly than 2017. This was one of the factors that led to the decrease between the years 2001 and 2017 of 83.26% of the ""Very High"" class potential for surface runoff and the ""Very Low"" class increase in the order of 38.74% . The effects caused by precipitation types in the runoff process, as well as in soil loss are directly related to the duration and intensity of precipitation 
The areas with the higher slope (greater than 20%) are located in the eastern, central, and western portions of the sub-basin, moderately interfering with potential runoff. Soil texture varies from sandy to clayey texture, with a thickness ranging from less than 2 m up to over 10 m. From the western portion to the center of the sub-basin there are also scattered spots of clayey soils whose thickness does not exceed 5 m, regions with greater potential flow, influenced by the characteristics of the soils.
Considering this general scenario in RCW, and focusing in minimizing impacts from surface runoff, these set of recommendations were proposed.
""Very Low "" and ""Low "" classes' areas favor infiltration and recharging aquifers, needing cares related to farming conservative techniques and water resources protection. Some soil physical attributes can be modified by soil management and conservation practices are adopted, and the rate of infiltration of soil water can be modified, more favoring infiltration process.
In ""Medium "" class areas the above strategies needs to be associated with vegetation cover protection, mainly in areas of higher slope values, since the suppression of the vegetation can contribute to the reduction of the infiltration capacity and generate an increase in the surface runoff and the erosive processes resulting from it 
Inadequate management and poor soil conservation practices have been considered as the main factors influencing surface runoff, resulting in changes in water infiltration conditions in soils and an increase in surface runoff, which may link erosion processes 
In ""High "" and ""Very High "" Potential areas, measures should be applied in agricultural areas with annual crops that can reduce runoff, such as terracing to reduce water loss and soil retention of streams when precipitation extrapolates the soil infiltration capacity. Another interesting alternative to reduce runoff is vertical infiltration furrow, which can provide increased water volume in the slopes, allowing perennial drainage channels 
It is important to preserve forest areas and Permanent Preservation Areas (APP) in accordance with the Forest Code (Law no. 12.651/2012) ( BRASIL, 2012 ), as the absence of vegetation cover increases the probability of soil, either by detachment of particles or by removal of the surface layer from the soil. Secondly, such a measure has the benefit of decreasing the likelihood of sedimentation of water bodies. 
In the case of high-slope slopes, the reduction of the flow velocity obtained by the installation of energy sinks can be a tool to reduce the increase in surface runoff 
Although the Surface Runoff Potential Charts does not highlight the urban areas of the basin, it is essential to consider that urban growth tends to increase the waterproofed area, increasing the flow velocity. Thus, some specific measures can be adopted in urban areas, creating legal instruments that guarantee permeability rates between 20% and 30% of the total land area when it exceeds 300 m 2 of area; to build temporary rainwater storage tanks; deploy gardens along sidewalks; to implant sidewalks and gutters with drainage floors 
In urban areas, measures such as the green roof  | Conclusions: In general, surface runoff potential charts produced for RCW show significant influence of total annual rainfall in both considered years, evidencing the importance of climate change, either globally or regionally. Rio Claro Basin, considering natural or manmade attributes, occurs in vast areas of the southeastern region of Brazil, which is why the conclusions observed here can be extrapolated to a large area of the Paran√° Basin.
Considering local variations (sub-basins), we observe a strong control from soil texture and thickness and land use land cover in potential runoff. This situation indicates the need of large scale environmental management strategies, without neglecting local actions.
Surface Runoff Potential Chart enables the identification of specific areas that require constant monitoring to prevent and/or minimize negative impacts resulting from anthropic interventions, as leaching of fertilizers and pesticides that contaminate the soil and, consequently, the underground water resources from infiltration, and also the surface, with the flow of these components to the water courses changing their physical and chemical properties, often causing the eutrophication of water courses.
The proposed measures aim to favor infiltration, reducing the possibility of erosive processes in the soil and favoring the recharge of aquifer units. The results of this study can assist environmental managers and planners in their decision-making, aiming at a sustainable balance between socio-economic development and the rational use of water resources.","Effectiveness of alternative management scenarios on the sediment load in a Mediterranean agricultural watershed (, , , , 2014) || The effect of land cover change on duration and severity of high and low flows (, , 2017) || Land use and climate change impacts on runoff and soil erosion at the hillslope scale in the Brazilian Cerrado (, , , , 2018) || Use of Landsat thermal imagery in monitoring evapotranspiration and managing water resources (, , , , 2012) || Mapeamento do uso e ocupa√ß√£o do solo no munic√≠pio de Bel√©m de S√£o Francisco -PE nos anos de (, , , , 2014. 1985 e 2010) || Estimativa da infiltra√ß√£o de √°gua no solo na escala de bacia hidrogr√°fica (, , , , , , 2014) || Avalia√ß√£o do desempenho hidr√°ulico de um sistema de drenagem de √°guas pluviais urbanas (, , , 2018) || Lei n; 12.651, de 25 de maio de 2012.

Here, we present the first results from a project aimed at annual multidecadal land monitoring providing critical information for tracking global progress towards sustainable development. The global 30-m spatial resolution dataset quantifies changes in forest extent and height, cropland, built-up lands, surface water, and perennial snow and ice extent from the year 2000 to 2020. Landsat Analysis Ready Data served as an input for land cover and use mapping. Each thematic product was independently derived using locally and regionally calibrated machine learning tools. Thematic maps validation using a statistical sample of reference data confirmed their high accuracy (user's and producer's accuracies above 85% for all land cover and land use themes, except for built-up lands). Our results revealed dramatic changes in global land cover and land use over the past 20 years. The bitemporal dataset is publicly available and serves as a first input for the global land monitoring system.","INTRODUCTION: The implementation of global initiatives towards sustainable development, climate change mitigation, and maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem functions, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Paris Agreement and COP26 Glasgow Declaration, the Convention on Biological Diversity, the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and others depends on the timely provision of relevant data on land cover and land use change (LCLUC) at global, national, and local scales. The need for globally consistent LCLUC data has long been a priority of the scientific community, with the promise of improved quantification made possible through the use of remote sensing data 
The LCLUC data user community requires diverse thematic data for their applications. Earth resources and climate change scientists, national land management and reporting agencies, non-government environmental organizations, and civil society all need different thematic products that are impossible to provide using a single LCLU classification system 
A suite of thematic maps that reflects LCLU composition, structure, and dynamics at the product cell (pixel) scale is an alternative to discrete-legend characterization. The Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) approach provides per-pixel continuous fractional cover of the major land cover types, namely woody vegetation, herbaceous vegetation, and nonvegetated land cover. The VCF products were created at global and national scales using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 
The Landsat program jointly operated by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) provides the only satellite data record that enables multidecadal LCLUC assessment at medium spatial resolution 
Recent advances in Landsat data processing into analysisready data enhanced our capacity to map LCLUC globally with higher precision and thematic detail. The Landsat analysis-ready data processing and machine learning algorithms were successfully employed for global forest monitoring  | METHODS: We derived most global thematic products, except open water, using consistently processed Landsat Analysis Ready Data  | Landsat Data: The Landsat data archive enabled multidecadal LCLUC monitoring at global extent and medium (30 m per pixel) spatial resolution. For all thematic products except water, we used the spatiotemporally consistent Landsat GLAD ARD inputs available from https://glad.umd.edu/ard as the source data for global LCLU mapping. The GLAD ARD product consists of 16day global Landsat normalized surface reflectance and brightness temperature composites combined from the best quality observations. The entire Landsat Collection 1 Tier 1 data archive over the land area between 75 ¬∞N and 56 ¬∞S from 1997 to 2020 was processed. Small islands, Arctic islands (e.g., Novaya Zemlya), and Greenland were excluded from the GLAD ARD extent due to the absence of high-quality Tier 1 data or a short growing season (Figure 
We integrated the annual GLAD ARD 16-day clear-sky time series into a set of rank-based statistics, hereafter named phenology metrics, that enabled the application of the multitemporal classification and regression models. Observations contaminated by cloud and cloud shadows were excluded. To avoid data inconsistency and gaps in cloudy regions (where only a few clear-sky observations per year are available) we implemented a gap-filling technique. For the forest structure and perennial snow/ice mapping, we added observations collected during three preceding years (e.g., 1997-1999 for the year 2000) in case a gap between clear-sky observations was longer than a month. For cropland mapping, we integrated all available 16-day data into an annualized time series for 
For each metric, we used the original per-pixel value along with the 3 √ó 3-pixels average value. The metric methodology is presented in detail in 
We augmented the Landsat reflectance metrics with topographic metrics, including elevation and slope. These   | Thematic Mapping and Change Detection: Forest Height, Extent, and Disturbance
We mapped the height of woody vegetation for the years 2000 and 2020 using the approach of 
We employed the global Landsat-based woody vegetation height mapping model calibrated for the year 2019 using GEDI observations 
The training data for each model were aggregated from GEDI observations between 40 ¬∞N and 52 ¬∞N and manually collected samples of treeless wetlands and tundra areas. The model calibrated for the year 2019 was applied to 
The forest disturbance data for the 2001-2020 interval is the result of the combination of two datasets: the Global Forest Loss (GFL) data V1.8 
The woody vegetation height values for the years 2000 and 2020 were calculated as the median of 
We produced the year 2000 and 2020 forest extent maps by attributing pixels with ‚â•5 m forest height as the ""forest"" land cover class. The forest extent change (net forest extent loss and gain) was derived directly from the year 2000 and 2020 map comparison. The woody vegetation heigh maps were used to stratify forest extent by height classes. The forest height increase and decrease maps employed conservative definition of height change to eliminate noise in the annual model application. We calculated the net forest height increase only if a pixel had height ‚â•5 m in 2020 and 1) had forest height <5 m in 2000 or 2) had net forest height increase from the year 2000-2020 by ‚â•100%. Similarly, the net forest height loss was calculated only for pixels with year 2000 forest heigh ‚â•5 m if forest height reduced below 5 m or the net height reduction was by ‚â•50% of the year 2000 value. Areas with small differences between the years 2000 and 2020 forest height data that have no indication of forest disturbance are considered stable forests in this prototype product. | Cropland: Cropland was defined as land used to produce annual and perennial herbaceous crops for human consumption, forage, and biofuel 
The cropland mapping model was calibrated with manually delineated training areas which were extrapolated in space and time through a three-stage algorithm 
Supervised classification (bagged decision tree ensembles) was implemented at each of these three steps. At the first step, we selected 924 GLAD ARD tiles that represent crop type and agricultural techniques diversity. For each tile, we calibrated an individual cropland mapping model using manually collected training data and 2016-2019 multitemporal metrics. At the second stage, we used the resulting crop maps as training data to calibrate regional models for the 2016-2019 interval. These models were applied to a set of time intervals to create a cropland map time series prototype. At the last step, we used the stable cropland and no cropland pixels from different time intervals as training to calibrate a set of local cropland mapping models. This way we created a set of individual cropland models (one for each 1 √ó 1 ¬∞tile) that allowed us to map cropland areas consistently for the 2000-2003 and 2016-2019 intervals. The final products were filtered by removing artifacts and cropland patches smaller than 0.5 ha. | Built-Up Lands: Built-up land consists of man-made land surfaces associated with infrastructure, commercial and residential land uses. At the Landsat spatial resolution, we define the built-up land class as pixels that include man-made surfaces, even if such surfaces do not dominate within the pixel  | Water: Open surface water, or simply water, is defined as inland water that covers ‚â•50% of a pixel and is not obscured by objects above the surface (e.g., tree canopy, floating aquatic vegetation, bridges, or ice). The presented multidecadal surface water change product is based on the annual water presence dataset produced by 
The water dynamics analysis had three major steps: 1) perscene Landsat data classification 1999-2020, 2) production of the annual water presence time series, and 3) multidecadal water dynamics characterization. The Landsat data for the water mapping was processed differently than for the other thematic products 
The annual water presence time series was derived from the counts of clear-sky water and land observations. To account for intra-annual variation in clear-sky observation frequency, we first calculated water presence per meteorological season. These products were integrated into annual water presence time series using seasonal weighting, for more details see 
The annual water presence maps were used to characterize the 1999-2020 water dynamics  | Perennial Snow and Ice: The perennial snow and ice layer includes land covered by glaciers and snow which remains during the entire year. The map is limited to the GLAD ARD tiles where perennial snow and ice areas were detected using the ARD observation quality layer. To define the mapping area, we first generated preliminary annual snow and ice maps by selecting the ARD pixels where 16-day observation quality layers show the presence of snow and ice and the absence of snow-free land or water within the year. Using these annual maps, we selected GLAD ARD tiles which contain perennial snow and ice in the year 2000 or 2020 (Figure 
We mapped permanent snow and ice using regionally calibrated supervised classification models (decision tree ensembles). Overall, we used 14 models, one model per mountain system or geographic region. Each classification model was calibrated with manually collected training data from multitemporal Landsat metrics. We used the Landsat data from the years 2000, 2010, and 2020 for training data collection. For each year, we compiled composites from Landsat observations during the peak land surface temperature and peak NDVI to separate perennial and annual snow cover. The training data were delineated using visual interpretation and integrated from 3 years to calibrate a single regional model. We iterated the models by assessing the classification output and adding training data. The final model was applied to the years 2000 and 2020, and the results were filtered using a set of rules to remove noise and artifacts. | Validation: We validated each thematic product separately using an independently collected reference sample. The individual Landsat GLAD ARD pixel (0.00025 ¬∞√ó 0.00025 ¬∞) served as a sampling unit. The sampling region consists of the thematic product mapping area which is equal to the GLAD ARD extent for forests, water, and built-up lands (Figure  | Forest Extent and Height: To estimate the accuracy of forest height mapping, we compared the forest height map for the year 2020 with the GEDI RH95 metric values within the extent of stable forests (forests that had map-based tree height ‚â•5 m in both years 2000 and 2020 and no indication of forest disturbance, degradation, or enhancement). We used the GEDI Collection 2 data collected between April 2019 and September 2020 for this comparison. Unlike the Collection 1 data that were used for model calibration 
To validate the forest extent and change product derived from the forest height dataset using the ‚â•5 m forest class definition, we used five strata designed to target stable and dynamic forests. The strata represented pixels which were characterized by the map time series as 1) stable non-forest; 2) stable forest; 3) forest extent loss; 4) forest extent gain; 5) forest that experienced disturbance, net loss, or gain of forest height, or was within a 30-m buffer of strata 3 or 4. We allocated 1,000 sample pixels in each of the strata equally, 200 sample pixels per stratum. To account for the latitude difference in GLAD ARD pixel area, we performed sampling of pixels with inclusion probabilities proportional to their area  | Cropland: The strata design for the cropland map time series represents the intersection of seven geographic regions (North and Central America, South America, Africa, Europe and Northern Asia, Southwest Asia, Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand) and five cropland change scenarios, including stable cropland and no cropland, cropland gain and loss, and possible cropland omission  | Built-Up Lands: The built-up map validation followed the same principles as forest extent validation. We defined four strata, including 1) stable built-up land, 2) low and 3) high confidence built-up gain, and 4) other lands. In each stratum, we randomly allocated 100 sample pixels (400 pixels total) that were interpreted using Landsat image composites and highresolution data from Google Earth. A sample pixel was assigned to the built-up class if the analyst detected the presence of a building or an infrastructure object within the pixel area. Two map classes were validated separately: stable builtup and built-up land expansion. The reference sample data were used to select the best threshold of built-up class likelihood (by balancing user's and producer's accuracies) in addition to map validation. | Water: The surface water 1999-2018 product validation was performed using a sample of 600 reference pixels allocated using a stratified random design created by  | Perennial Snow and Ice: For the perennial snow and ice product validation, we implemented a stratified sampling design with five strata: 1) stable snow/ice presence and 2) absence, 3) snow/ice gain and 4) loss between 2000 and 2020, and 5) a 30-m buffer around all detected snow/ice areas to quantify class omission. We randomly allocated 500 sample pixels (100 pixels per stratum) and interpreted these pixels using Landsat time series data. To ensure the correct separation of perennial and seasonal snow cover for each year, we used the 16-day Landsat ARD data composite with the highest brightness temperature for sample visualization and interpretation. | Map Analysis and Intercomparison: The global thematic map extent is limited by the land area where the Landsat ARD data was available (Figure 
We summarized the LCLU area and change by country and continent. Country boundaries were obtained from the Database of Global Administrative Areas (GADM V3.6, https://gadm.org). We delineated continents using national and administrative boundaries. We divided North and South America by the boundary between Panama and Colombia. We divided Europe and Asia by the Russian southern border and by the boundary of Russian administrative regions along the Ural Mountains. Australia includes New Zealand and Pacific Islands and is separated from Asia by the Indonesia/Papua-New Guinea country border.
We compared our map-based estimates with the official forest and cropland data provided by the FAO. The FAO Forest Resource Assessment 2020 (FAO, 2020) provides data on national forest areas for the years 2000 and 2020. The FAOSTAT year 2018 national arable land area and the year 2019 global herbaceous crop area were used to compare against our cropland area estimates 
The recently published global Sentinel-based 2020 WorldCover 2020 
To analyze the carbon emissions due to the forest loss, we estimated the average aboveground biomass carbon (AGC) density for each forest height and type strata using the harmonized global AGC map for the year 2010 
We performed a LCLUC hotspot analysis to highlight regions that have the highest intensity of the 2000-2020 change. Hotspots were selected for the four thematic LCLUC categories that have the highest environmental and social value: deforestation (defined as net forest loss for 2000-2020); forest AGC reduction for 2000-2020 (estimated using forest AGC strata area for years 2000 and 2020 and the per-strata mean AGC); net cropland gain for 2003-2019; and built-up area expansion for 2000-2020. The regions were defined using the Icosahedral Snyder Equal Area aperture 3 Hexagon Geodesic Discrete Global Grid System (ISEA3H GDGGS)  | RESULTS:  | Global Land Cover and Land Use Dynamics: Our global bitemporal maps portray changes in the Earth's land cover and land use during the first 20 years of the century. The results show the reduction of global tree cover extent and expansion of cropland and settlements. LCLU dynamics have distinct regional patterns reflecting the expansion and abandonment of intensive land management. Surface water dynamics have pronounced regional variation linked to hydropower projects and depletion of natural lakes in dry climates. The area of perennial snow and ice declined dramatically in a warming climate. The global and regional LCLUC areas were obtained directly from the maps, therefore regional area estimates may be biased due to map errors. Our global maps can facilitate the national and sub-national reporting provided that an additional statistical sampling approach and independent reference data collection are employed. | Forest Dynamics: We define forest as land cover with tree canopy height ‚â•5 m, including natural and planted trees. In the year 2020, the global forest area was 40.2 million km 2 , which makes up 31% of the analyzed land area (land area within the Landsat ARD product extent excluding inland water). During the last two decades, 2000-2020, forest extent decreased by 1 million km 2 , or by 2.4% of the year 2000 forest area (Table 
Asia and South America had the largest shares of global forest extent in 2020 (33 and 21%, respectively), while Europe and Australia's shares were the least (9 and 4%) (Table 
Our forest height maps provide information on land cover dynamics that is relevant for carbon monitoring. Here, we separated forest extent into three strata by forest height: short (5-9 m), medium-height (10-19 m), and tall (‚â•20 m) forests. Most of the world's forests have canopy heights of 10 m and higher. Of the total year 2020 forest area, short forests made up 24% while medium-height and tall forests made up 38% each (Figures 2B, 3A and Table 
Gross loss and gain dynamics affect short and medium-height forests more than tall forests. Of the global gross forest loss and gain area, only 20 and 12%, respectively, were found within tall forests. However, the ratio of gross forest gain to loss is lower for tall forests (0.34) than for short and medium-height forests (0.56  and 0.68, respectively). As a result, net forest loss area is highest for the tall forests strata (0.65 million km 2 , or 4.1% of the year 2000 forest area) (Table 
Intensive gross forest loss and gain in short and mediumheight forests of Asia are nearly balanced and resulted in a small net area gain (Figure 
Tall forests store the highest amount of carbon per unit of area 
Reference sample data are the best tool for attribution of forest change proximity drivers 
Using the reference sample data, we estimated that 39% (s.e. 5%) of gross forest gain was due to man-made restoration or plantation establishment, and the remainder to natural forest restoration. Of the mapped gross forest gain, 5% were located within year 2020 built-up lands. Asia had the largest share of gross forest gain in settlements. Because the thematic land cover maps were derived independently, a small overlap between land cover classes may be due to the inconsistencies in mixed pixel attribution (e.g., a mixed pixel on the border of cropland and forest may be attributed as both these classes). Given this limitation, findings from the land cover map overlays should be confirmed with reference sample data. | Cropland Dynamics: Global cropland area increased by 11.5% between the 2000-2003 interval and the 2016-2019 interval (Table 
The largest net cropland area increase was in Africa (by 0.5 million km 2 ), followed by Asia and South America. South America had the largest relative cropland area increase (45% of the year 2000 cropland area) followed by Africa (33% increase), while other continents increased their cropland area by less than 10%.
During the last 20 years, the gross global cropland area expansion (2.3 million km 2 ) was twice higher than the cropland area reduction (1.1 million km 2 ). In Europe and North America, where crop expansion (mostly through pasture or long fallow conversion) and reduction (through abandonment or conversion to other land uses) are balanced, the resulting net cropland area change was small. In Africa and South America, cropland expansion is four times and six times (respectively) higher than reduction, driving net cropland area increase.
In 2019, six countries, the USA, India, China, Russia, Brazil, and Australia, hosted more than half of the global cropland area (Figure 
Our sample reference data 
Global cropland reduction was primarily driven by crop abandonment or conversion into pastures (52% of cropland loss area,  | Built-Up Lands Expansion: The map-based year 2020 global built-up lands area was 4.3 million km 2 , nearly half of which (47%) was in Asia (Figure  | Water Dynamics: Globally, 3.5 million km 2 were mapped as persistent inland open water in 2020. Persistent water was defined as ‚â•50% annual water presence, excluding snow and ice cover. North America had the most inland surface water, representing 46% of all persistent water in 2020, followed by Asia with 27%. Africa, South America, and Europe each shared 8-9% of global persistent water area, and Australia had only 0.4%. Canada alone represents 34% of the global surface water, largely due to the water-saturated landscape of the Canadian Shield (Figure 
Considering 1999-2020 interannual dynamics, North America had the most surface water, with 39% of the global total for all water dynamic classes and 51% of all permanent water. The surface water extent of North America is the most stable with permanent water composing 63% of its total water extent. Asia had the largest extent of dynamic water presence (44% global total) but only 22% of permanent water. The surface water extent in Australia was the most dynamic with 82% of its total water area being seasonally (44%) or interannually variable (39%) and only 18% permanent.
On the national scale, Kazakhstan had the largest share of global surface water loss (14%) following by Uzbekistan (8%) due to the decline of the Aral and Caspian Seas  (Figure  | Perennial Snow and Ice Reduction: Our global mapping extent excludes the largest Earth's ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. Within the analyzed land area (between 75 ¬∞N and 56 ¬∞S), the perennial snow and ice cover is mostly found within mountain regions in the form of mountain and valley glaciers and snowcaps, and as perennial snowfields in the Arctic. For mapping purposes, we define perennial snow and ice by the land cover during the hottest time of the year at the Landsat ARD pixel scale. A pixel was assigned to this thematic class if snow or ice cover was detected for the Landsat observation with the highest annual land surface temperature.
Our bitemporal maps show that the area of perennial snow and ice within the analyzed part of the globe decreased by   11.5%. Such a high area loss, however, was not confirmed by our sample analysis, which quantifies the total loss of snow and ice cover by 6.6% (see section 3.2.5). The overestimation is related to the year 2000 snow and ice commission error. While our maps may not serve for direct estimation of ice and snow cover change, they can be used to indicate change hotspots. The highest rate of snow and ice decline was found in Africa (Table  | Map Accuracy and Product Intercomparison:  | Forest Height and Extent: The year 2019 forest height model validation results are provided in 
The sample-based validation revealed that the maps of forest extent 2000 and 2020 and the stable forest class extent have high accuracies, with both user's and producer's accuracies above 93% (Table 
Our global map-based forest area estimates are very similar to the global forest area reported by FAO Forest Resource Assessment 2020 (FAO FRA) (FAO, 2020), with less than 1% difference for both year 2000 and 2020 total forest area (Figure 
The ESA WorldCover 2020 overestimates our map-based forest area and FAO FRA forest area by 7 and 6%, respectively (Figure 
We compared our new year 2000 forest extent map (based on the ‚â•5 m forest height threshold) with the forest extent map that was obtained by applying canopy cover thresholds on the tree canopy cover map for the year 2000  | Cropland Extent: The year 2000-2003 and 2016-2019 interval cropland maps have high quality, with both user's and producer's accuracies above 86% (Table 
The cropland area change map has higher uncertainty compared to the crop extent maps, specifically, for the cropland gain class, which has relatively low user's accuracy (Table 
A comparison of the national 2016-2019 cropland area with the year 2018 arable land estimates published by the FAO showed good agreement (R 2 of 0.98) 
We compared our global cropland area estimates with the FAO land cover statistics for the year 2019 that is derived from multiple data sources, including MODIS Land Cover product (MCD12Q1), Catholic University of Louvain Geomatics land cover (CCILC), and Copernicus Global Land Service land cover product (CGLS) 
The cropland areas from our map and the ESA WorldCover 2020 product are very similar (Figure  | Built-Up Land Extent: The built-up lands class is inherently heterogeneous at the Landsat pixel scale, which impedes the accurate class mapping and reference data collection. We defined built-up lands as Landsat pixels that contains man-made constructions or surfaces, like buildings and roads. This thematic class effectively outlines the extent of human settlements, by it is not sensitive to internal settlement structure when different land covers (impervious surfaces, soil, trees, grass) are intermixed within the Landsat pixel. The reference data for the validation exercise considered the presence of man-made surfaces, even when they did not occupy most of the pixel area. Consequently, the user's and producer's accuracies for stable built-up class and built-up expansion are relatively low (Table 
Despite the low accuracies of the built-up class, the over-and underestimation rates are balanced, and the total map-based class area is within the 95% confidence interval of the sample-based estimate (Figure 
Our year 2020 built-up lands area is nearly five times higher than the ESA WorldCover 2020 built-up class area due to definition differences. (Figure  | Water Dynamic: Annual 2000 water percent has high and balanced user's and producer's accuracies of 92.2 and 92.8%, respectively, when thresholded at ‚â•50% water presence. However, mapping water dynamics is much more difficult as reflected by the accuracies of the dynamic classes (Table 
The map-based areas of total area with open surface water within 1999-2018 (4.8 million km 2 ) are within 1% of the sample-based area estimates of  | Perennial Snow and Ice Extent: The snow and ice extent and dynamic maps have high producer's accuracies (above 86%), which confirms that these maps correctly delineate the extent of glaciers and perennial snowfields (Table 
The ESA WorldCover data shows the much larger area of persistent snow and ice than our map (Figure  | Global LCLUC Hotspots: The global hotspots map (Figure 
Most of the built-up expansion area found in South and Southeast Asia, with the largest hotspots in China, India, Turkey, and Indonesia (Figure 
The global thematic maps provide insights into LCLU change trajectories. We show that net forest loss was partly driven by cropland and settlement expansion (sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2). The reduction of perennial snow and ice (section 3.1.5) was likely caused by climate warming, which is in turn linked to carbon emissions from forest AGC reduction (section 3.1.1) and agriculture development (section 3.1.2). The changes in land management priorities resulted in cropland conversion to settlements (section 3.1.2) and flooding forests and croplands by water reservoirs.
Global LCLUC data support the development, implementation, and monitoring of national land management policies and global initiatives towards climate change mitigation and protection of natural ecosystems. Here, we will outline just a few examples of possible applications of our bitemporal maps. Spatially explicit maps highlight regions where investments in sustainable development, nature protection, and mitigation of climate change effects are most needed. Our forest change data shows that 50% of the global forest AGC reduction is due to forest clearing in just three countries, Brazil, Indonesia, and the DRC, highlighting the need for national policies combating deforestation. The overlay of our forest and cropland change data with protected areas and primary forests highlights conservation priority targets  | Limitations of Thematic Maps: It is well known that any thematic LCLU map derived from the satellite images has errors 
Landsat clear-sky data availability is the primary limitation for land cover mapping. While some of the land cover themes can be directly mapped using a single-day satellite images (e.g., surface water), others may not be directly retrieved from the optical medium resolution data and instead are predicted using empirical modeling tools that requires information on land surface phenology (such as forest height or cropland extent). The incompleteness of the Landsat observation time series decreases map accuracy in regions with persistent cloud cover. For the perennial snow and ice mapping, the availability of Landsat observations during the warmest time of the year is critical, and the absence of such observations causes class overestimation. Short revisit interval is the key requirement for future satellite missions aimed at global LULC monitoring.
A high proportion of mixed pixels at the Landsat spatial resolution is another important constraint for discrete land cover classes mapping in heterogeneous landscapes. Most LULC classes have higher map accuracy over large homogeneous areas compared to fragmented landscapes and class patch edges. Cropland maps are more accurate over industrial agriculture areas (North and South Americas) compared to fragmented rural landscapes (Europe, Asia, and Africa). Some classes, like settlements and infrastructure, mostly consist of mixed pixels and thus may be hard to map using per-pixel classifications. To overcome some of these issues, we implemented a CNN tool that considers spatial properties and distribution of objects for mapping built-up lands. Small features (fractional water, single trees, isolated houses, and narrow roads) cannot be consistently mapped globally using Landsat data and are usually omitted by global maps.
The spectral similarity between different LCLU classes may preclude class discrimination. Lava fields, dark soils and vegetation, and high turbidity are typical reasons for surface water mapping errors. Croplands may be confused with intensively managed permanent pastures as both classes have similar spectral response and phenology, which caused crop commission in Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Western Europe. Rainfed dryland agriculture is not always spectrally separable from the surrounding natural land cover, which is the reason for crop omission in the Sahel, Central Asia, and the Middle East.
Continuous structure variables, such as forests height, are the most challenging to map using medium resolution optical data. Our forest height product has issues related to GEDI data quality and Landsat data availability 
Dynamic classes (LCLU class loss and gain) have lower accuracies compared to static maps. The changes in Landsat data frequency and sensor radiometric resolution are primary factors for temporal inconsistencies of the LCLU maps. The change data was filtered to reduce errors, which, in turn, may result in land cover change omission.
Thematic maps provide valuable data for global LCLUC analysis. Direct map-based area estimations may be used to highlight trends and hotspots of land change and to compare areas of thematic classes and their change between regions. However, map-based estimates are not adequate for national and international reporting due to unknown spatial and temporal variability of map errors.

"Land use and land cover change detection using geospatial techniques in the Sikkim Himalaya, India",Prabuddh Mishra; Aman Rai; Chand Rai,"Mapping and monitoring of land use land cover (LULC) changes in the Himalayas is vital for sustainable development, planning and management. Based on remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques, the study is an attempt to monitor the changes in LULC patterns of Rani Khola","Introduction: The potential of satellite based data as a basis for generating valuable information for LULC is by now widely recognized 
Land-use/cover is largely determined by the ecological conditions, altitudes, geological structure and slope along with technological, socio-economic and institutional set-up, which also influences the land-use pattern 
In the present study Multi-temporal satellite images of Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and a High resolution (10 m) Sentinel 2A Imagery has been used to map the changing pattern of LULC of Rani Khola watershed from 1988 to 2017. Land-use/cover in the study watershed is largely determined by the ecological conditions, altitudes, geological structure and slope. Apart from the above factors, technological, socio-economic and institutional set-up is also expected to influence the LULC pattern 
There have been some attempts to study the LULC and inventory of resources in Sikkim Himalaya  | Materials and methods:  | Study area: The present study was conducted in Rani Khola watershed located in the East District of Sikkim State, India (Fig.  | Data source: Multi-temporal Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) imageries of  | Methodology: Overall methodological framework and data analysis is presented in Fig.  | Pre-processing: ASTER DEM was used to extract the boundary of the Rani Khola watershed. Satellite imageries were available in TOA and converted in Bottom of Atmospheric Reflectance (BOA) using Semi-Automatic Classification Plug-in of QGIS software. After the conversion of TOA reflectance to BOA reflectance, sentinel SWIR bands were resampled from 20 m to 10 m. Thereafter, all five bands of satellite imagery were stacked and watershed boundary generated from ASTER DEM was used for subsetting all the imageries. Standard false colour composite (FCC) of all decades was created for mapping. | Land-cover classification scheme: To prepare the LULC map from satellite imageries, a classification scheme which defines the LULC classes was considered. The numbers of LULC classes are preferred based on the requirement of a specific project for a particular application 
2.3.3. Post processing 2.3.3.1. Supervised classification. After the preparation of classification scheme one of the most widely used image classification technique, i.e., maximum likelihood classification was adopted for mapping all the land use/cover classes. Before the selection of training samples, empirical analysis of satellite imagery; google earth images and toposheet of the watershed were investigated carefully. For most of the classes, a minimum number of training samples were 100. Selecting training samples for water was tough because of the dense canopy of forests along with the river channel and lack of water in the river channels since the acquisition date of imagery was in mid-November and at that time most of the rivers in the mountains carry less water as compared to the monsoon season. | Field survey and accuracy assessment: A field survey was conducted for ground verification of doubtful areas with the help of GPS and local guides in different parts of watershed covering all the LULC classes. Due to mountainous topography, rough terrain and steep slopes, few areas were not accessible. Photographs taken during the field survey are shown in Fig.  | LULC change detection: LULC map of 2017 was re-sampled on 30 m to match the spatial resolution of all the classified maps thereafter; post-classification change detection technique was used for analysing the changes. In the last few decades, many change detection methods have been developed viz; image differencing, post classification change matrix, comparison technique and principal component analysis  | Results:  | LULC status: Multi-temporal LULC covering six major classes: agricultural land, barren land, built-up area, dense forest, open forest and water-bodies of 
Results from classified maps indicated that in 1988 area occupied by different classes viz; agricultural land was about 20.46%, barren land was 4.38%, built-up area covered 2.82%, dense and open forest covered most part of the watershed and occupied about 38.26% and 34.07% area respectively. On the other hand, in 1996 about 15.08% of the area was covered by agricultural land against 20.46% area in 1988 showed a decrease in cultivated land. Barren land and builtup area covered 4.25% and 3.51% respectively while, dense forest had largest share of 41.35% followed by open forest 35.81%. The area covered by water bodies was less than 1% (0.01 km 2 ) of the total geographical area for the year 1988-1996 (Table 
Results from the classified image of 2008 illustrate that more than 50% of the area was covered by dense forest, whereas open forest share was 30%. Agricultural land occupied 12.75%; built-up area covered 3.60% while barren land and water bodies collectively covered 2.66% area. In 2017, the area under dense and open forest has fairly grown and covered 74.75% collectively. Agricultural lands and built-up area covered 17.63% and 4.95% area respectively (Table  | Field survey and accuracy assessment: During the field survey and accuracy assessment the notable differences found in classified image and actual ground were the misclassification of unpaved roads as barren lands and dirt roads as agricultural fallow land. In some areas exposed river bedrocks were also misclassified as built-up area. Photograph A captured the dense forest cover near Bhusuk village as shown in 
One of the most frequently used Kappa accuracy assessment technique was selected to assess the accuracy of classified map of 2017. Accuracy assessment was done using a high resolution (3.9 Meters) satellite imagery of Planet scope 300 stratified random points with minimum 20 points in each class were generated (Table  | Discussion:  | LULC changes: Several studies analyses changes in broad LULC in the Himalaya  | LULC patterns over the period of 1996-2008: Dense forests and built up area showed increasing trend during this time period, in contrast to decrease in the change rate of other     | Overall gain and loss:  | Conclusion: This study assessed and monitored the changes in LULC pattern in the Rani Khola watershed of Sikkim Himalaya using Landsat-5 TM and sentinel-2 data from 1988 to 2017. The result of this study reveals that the major land use in the watershed is forestry. Due to massive afforestation programme, declaration of Sikkim as organic state (2005), stringent law enforcement in forestry sector and sustainable agroforestry systems the area under dense forest has increased by 16.4% (41.76 km 2 ) between 1988 and 2017. Open forest showed increasing trend during 1988-1996 whereas decreasing trend has been observed during 1996-2017, this may be associated with the conversion of open forest into dense forest area. The second dominant land use is agriculture which was recorded as 17.63% (2017) as against 12.75% in 2008 due to traditional agroforestry practices, horticulture, floriculture and animal husbandry which is widely practiced by the. During the study period , barren land has been decreased significantly due to conversion in agriculture, vegetation and built-up land. The major changes in built up area were noted along the periphery of the Gangtok being the capital city due to urban sprawl and expansion of the town area during the last two decades.
Since forestry and agriculture are the predominant user of land, their quality (soils) and quantity (area) is directly related to the nature of landforms. This data would ultimately help to identify limiting resources as also the environmentally critical areas which can be delimited as hot spots for conservation or remediation. The evaluation of resources would also lead to understand the impacts of various developmental activities on these resources on the one hand and the planning process on the other. Present study utilizes the RS and GIS approach which is one of the most prominent technology at present for spatio-temporal analysis which is not possible through other conventional mapping techniques. The analysis and findings of the study have important policy implications for the sustainable land-use/cover practices in the Sikkim Himalaya.","A land use and land cover classification system for use with remote sensor data (, 1976) || Multi-source classification using artificial neural network in a rugged terrain (, , 2001) || Inferring urban land use by spatial and structural pattern recognition (, , , 2001. 19th February 2019) ||  (, ) || Diagrammatic illustration of land use/cover change in percent in Rani Khola watershed (, ) || An analysis of land use/cover change in Indonesia (, , , , 1996) || Assessment of climate change impact on river flow regimes in The Red River Delta, Vietnam-a case study of the Nhue-Day River Basin (, , , , 2016) || Ministry of Environment and Forests: Dehradun, India (, 2017. 19th February 2019) || Modeling the hydrological impacts of land use/land cover changes in the Andassa watershed, blue Nile basin (, , , , 2018) || GIS assessment of land use/land cover changes associated with community forestry implementation in the Middle Hills of Nepal (, , , 2002. 2002) || What Drives Tropical Deforestation?

"Effects of Long-Term Land Use and Land Cover Changes on Ecosystem Service Values: An Example from the Central Rift Valley, Ethiopia",Wolde Mekuria; Merga Diyasa; Anna Tengberg; Amare Haileslassie,"Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) are the leading contributors to the decline and loss of ecosystem services in the world. The present study covered the Central Rift Valley lakes basin in Ethiopia, focusing on the valley floor and the East and West escarpments, to analyze changes in LULC and to estimate associated losses in ecosystem service values (ESVs). Covering both upstream and downstream areas in the basin, the study addressed major gaps in existing studies by connecting the sources and sinks of material (e.g., sediment and water) in source-to-lake systems. Additionally, the study facilitated the identification of critical areas for conserving natural resources and reversing the decline of associated ESVs in the Central Rift Valley. A post-classification comparison approach was used to detect LULC changes between 1973 and 2020 using four Landsat images from 1973, 1990,  2005 and 2020. The value transfer valuation method was used to estimate the changes in ESVs due to LULC changes. Among the seven major identified LULC classes, farmlands, settlements, and bare lands showed positive changes, while forestlands, grasslands, shrublands and waterbodies showed negative changes over the last 47 years. The expansion of farmlands, for example, has occurred at the expense of grasslands, forestlands and shrublands. The changes in LULC over a period of 47 years resulted in a total loss of US $62,110.4 √ó 10 6 in ESVs. The contributors to the overall loss of ESVs in decreasing order are provisioning services (US $33,795.1 √ó 10 6 ), cultural services (US $28,981.5 √ó 10 6 ) and regulating services (US $652.9 √ó 10 6 ). The results imply that addressing the degradation of land and water resources is crucial to reversing the loss of ecosystem services and achieving the national Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to food and water security (SDGs 2 and 6) and life on land (SDG 15).","Introduction: The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 
Pressures on ecosystem services are among the most critical global challenges 
In Sub-Sharan Africa, LULC under improper land management is a major challenge e.g., 
As in other Sub-Saharan African countries, the expansion of agriculture, urbanization, extraction of forest products, the prevalence of drought, poor land-use planning and increasing human and livestock populations are driving a significant change in LULC in Ethiopia, and these changes in LULC are causing considerable losses in ecosystem services 
The Central Rift Valley (CRV) and the surrounding escarpments, the study area, is one of the most environmentally sensitive areas in Ethiopia and is currently experiencing considerable LULC changes 
Most of these studies, however, have estimated the changes in ESVs in response to LULC changes at watershed or sub-watershed level and have not estimated the impact at basin level connecting both upstream and downstream areas and flows of ecosystem services 
Unlike the previously conducted studies, the present study used ESV coefficients updated in 2020  | Materials and Methods: The present study covered the CRV Lakes basin, which is part of the great African rift valley and the East and West escarpments (i.e., the Arsi and Gurage highlands), Ethiopia (Figure 
The study area includes a wide range of ecosystems, including farmland, forestland, waterbodies, shrubland and grassland, which provide humans with a range of important ecosystem services. The study area is endowed with a suitable land potential for rainfed and irrigated agriculture. Over 95% of the total agricultural land is cultivated by smallholder farmers and most of the agricultural production is rainfed.
Table 
The collection of Ground Control Points (GCPs) employed the following steps. First, we conducted unsupervised image classification to identify the major LULC classes. At this stage, we identified seven major LULC classes; bare land, forestland, shrubland, grassland, farmland, settlements and waterbodies. Second, we used a random sampling technique to select sampling points for gathering GCPs from each identified LULC class. Third, we gathered GCPs from each selected point in each LULC class during field surveys conducted in June 2020. We followed these steps to ensure the collection of GCPs from all major LULC classes and fair representation during training and verification of image classification. During the entire field survey, data for 206 GCPs and an additional 394 reference points from google earth were collected for classification and accuracy assessment. The collection of GCPs was aided by topographic maps and a Global Positioning System with a positional error of ¬±3 m.
The actual classification was carried out after the training data had been established (half of the sampled data) and the classification was conducted using the Maximum Likelihood Classifier 
Table  | LULC Classes Description: Bare Lands Represents degraded land because of soil erosion and are left without crops, exposed rocks and dried-up lake or wetland beds. | Farmland: Represents lands covered with agricultural crops and include smallholder rainfed and irrigated lands as well as government owned mechanized agriculture or irrigated croplands. | Settlements: This class includes intensively used lands, such as rural villages, towns, and roads. | Forest: Represents both natural and fragmented plantation forest areas greater or equal to 0.05 ha, where the trees reach a minimum height of 5 m at maturity, consisting of closed forest formations where various stories and undergrowth cover a high proportion of the ground. It includes young natural stands and all plantations established for forestry purposes, which reach a crown density of 10%. | Grassland: Represents lands where short grasses are the predominant natural vegetation. It also includes land with scattered or patches of trees, used for grazing and browsing. | Shrubland: Land supporting an assemblage of small trees and shrubs. It also includes land with scattered or patches of trees and bush lands. | Waterbody: Land covered by water, mainly lakes and wetlands.
Accuracy assessment (overall, producer and user accuracies) and Kappa coefficient were determined by comparing the area extent of the LULC classes in the classified images with the reference data set using error matrices. The accuracy of the classified image was assessed using 420 random reference points for each year of analysis (i.e., 
where OA is overall accuracy, X is the total number of correctly classified values in the diagonals of the matrix, Y is the total number of reference points, PA is the producer accuracy, Q is the number of correctly classified pixels in each category (on the major diagonal), R is the number of reference pixels ""known"" to be of that category (the column total), UA is the user accuracy, A is the number of correctly classified pixels in each category, B is the total number of pixels that were classified in that category (the row total). K is Kappa coefficient, r is the number of rows in the matrix, xii is the number of observations in row i and column i, xi+ are the marginal totals of row i, x + i are the marginal totals column i and M is the total number of observations in the matrix. We used a post-classification comparison approach to determine changes in LULC classes in three intervals; 
To map the transition matrix of losses and gains with each LULC between the four periods, the land-use change module (LUCM), which is an extension to ArcGIS, was used. The magnitude of LULC change experienced between the different periods was expressed in percent Equation ( 
where PC is percentage change, RC is the rate of change in ha yr -1 , X is the area of LULC in ha in time 2, Y is the area of LULC in ha in time 1, Z is the time interval between X and Y in years.
The change in ecosystem service values (ESVs) was assessed using the classified 
The Ecosystem Services Valuation Database (ESVD) is a follow-up to ""The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity"" (TEEB) database which contained over 1300 data points from 267 case studies on monetary values of ecosystem services across all biomes 
The recently updated global ecosystem service valuation database (ESVD)  | Results and Discussion:  | Accuracy of the Classification Process: The overall accuracy for the base year (i.e., 1973) was 90%, 87% for 1990, 86% for 2005, and 88% for 2020. The Kappa coefficient for 1973 was 0.88, 0.85 for 1990, 0.84 for 2005, and 0.86 for 2020. Figure  | Change in Land Use and Land Cover: We detected that farmlands, grasslands and shrublands are distributed throughout the basin, but forestlands are dominantly found in the highlands (i.e., in eastern and western escarpments), and waterbodies (mainly lakes) and bare lands are concentrated in the valley floor (Figure 
Farmlands, bare lands and settlement areas showed positive changes, while forest, grasslands, shrublands and waterbodies showed negative changes over the analyzed 47-year period (Table 
The expansion of agricultural lands and the associated decrease in forestland, shrubland and grassland, as well as the expansion of bare lands at the expense of waterbodies can be explained by the growing pressures on land from increasing population and livestock in the basin. Several major assessments e.g.,  | Changes in the Total Ecosystem Service Values: Table  | Changes in the Total Ecosystem Service Values: Table  | Impact of Land Use and Landcover Changes on the Specific Ecosystem Service Values: Most of the ecosystem services were reduced during the observation period compared to the base year (Table  | Implications for Landscape Management: The results of the present study indicate that the impacts of LULC changes in the basin on ecosystem services are considerable. In particular, the degradation of forest resources and waterbodies (e.g., rivers, lakes) in the CRV lakes basin needs further attention as their degradation in the basin is contributing significantly to the loss of a multitude of ESVs. The main human drivers identified included increasing pressures from human and livestock populations, which in turn lead to an enhanced demand for food, water and raw materials. It could, therefore, be argued that these provisioning ecosystem services have been prioritized at the expense of regulating services, such as water flows, as well cultural ecosystem services. Regulating services are best addressed at the basin and landscape scale, as they require integrated management of different land cover classes at scale and the linking of upstream and downstream interventions. In the face of climate change and recurrent drought, this is becoming even more important. Integrated basin and landscape approaches also need to engage with stakeholders at multiple levels and be participatory. Mapping of stakeholder interest and influence, benefit-sharing dialogues for shared visioning, and multi-stakeholder platforms for coordinated decision-making and learning are important 
In line with this, using different policy incentives for landscape management, such as payment for ecosystem services and integration of income generating activities within land management practices, could help restore degraded forests and landscapes. The use of incentives for forest and landscape restoration, for example, helps to bridge the gap between landscape restoration and ecosystem services in the long term and local economic losses in the short term. This, in turn, supports local communities to adopt long-term conservation approaches (e.g., exclosures for landscape restoration) and to maintain or increase the ESVs of the natural resources in the basin. For example, Kibret et al. 
This study has shown how long-term LULC changes can have negative impacts on a wide range of ecosystem services and that in general the regulating, supporting and cultural ecosystem services are more negatively impacted than provisioning services, e.g., provision of food, feed and energy. Changes in LULC need to be monitored and managed at the basin and landscape scales to manage trade-offs between different ecosystem services and to balance losses and gains of land cover within the same land cover classes. This will contribute to the achievement of national SDG targets related to food and water security (SDGs 2 and 6) and life on land (SDG15). This also requires adaptive management of ecosystems and natural resources  | Conclusions: The present study covered the Central Rift Valley lakes basin in Ethiopia, focusing on the valley floor and the East and West escarpments, to analyze changes in LULC and to estimate associated losses in ecosystem service values (ESVs), as well as to facilitate the identification of critical areas for conserving natural resources and reversing the decline of associated ESVs. Covering both upstream and downstream areas in the basin, the study addressed major gaps in existing studies by connecting the sources and sinks of material (e.g., sediment and water) in source-to-lake systems. The long-term LULC changes observed in this study have negative impacts on a wide range of ecosystem services. Therefore, this supports that LULC are the leading contributors to the decline and loss of ecosystem services in the CRV. This, in turn, suggests that addressing the decline in forest cover and waterbodies, the major observed LULC changes in CRV, plays a vital role in improving ecosystem services in the CRV lakes basin. Our analysis of LULC changes and the associated losses in ecosystem service values can provide a guide as to where to focus when planning and implementing landscape restoration measures."," (, 1827.7 350,090.8 -23,994.1 -126,999.8 2690.7 -207,748.9 4133.7 2005-2020 Loss-2020) || Millennium Ecosystem Assessment.

Assessment of land use/land cover changes and their impacts on land surface temperature in Bangui (the capital of Central African Republic),Mamadou Traore; Mai Lee; Azad Rasul; Abel Balew,"Extreme land-use and land-cover (LULC) as the result of rapid urbanization has been raising land surface temperature of core city areas and its surrounding. Therefore, investigation on surface temperature is very vital to analyze temperature variations and minimize its effect. This research aims to analyze the impacts of LULC changes on LST in Bangui city, Central African Republic using combined techniques of remote sensing and GIS. The result of this study indicates that there was a significant change in LULC between 1986 and 2017 particularly expanded in vegetation and built-up areas and declined in bare soil. For instance, built-up increased by + 130.29 % with a rate of 137.06; and vegetation increased by 8.44% or a rate of 17.2. Whereas bare soil was sharply declined by -35.33% for a rate of -155.83. The mean LST of the city firstly decreased from 26.24 ¬∞C in 1986 to 23.37 ¬∞C  in 1999 and increased to 27.23 ¬∞C in 2017.  The study also stated that the mean LST of built-up areas increased from 26.21 ¬∞C in 1986 to 27.59 ¬∞C in 2017. Besides, the mean LST of bare soil raised from 26.51 ¬∞C to 27.33 ¬∞C in 1986 and 2017 respectively. These indicate that built up and bare soil experienced high LST than vegetation and water body. The study found a positive correlation between NDBI and LST whereas negative correlations of LST with NDVI and NDLI. City planners should be implemented urban green belts and green roof to mitigate the effect of surface urban heat islands (SUHI) in the city and its surooundings.","Introduction: Currently, many regions around the globe under different environmental conditions are facing dramatic changes in LULC 
Over time, land-use change maps provide essential information for land-use planning 
Though several studies have been done in different regions of the world, yet the problem of urban climate change mainly SUHI effects is the burning issue of world cities. This initiate to conduct the study and to provide information for city planners about LULC change and its impact on LST. The study has the objective to examine the impacts of LULC changes on LST in Bangui city from 1986 to 2017 using Landsat images. Therefore, the study is very essential for city planners, municipality experts, as well as other higher officials since the results of the study provide significant information about the trend of LULC change and its impact on LST and enable to impliment SUHI mitigation measures. | Material and methods:  | Study area: Geographically, Bangui city is located in between 4¬∞18 ‚Ä≤ 9"" N to 4¬∞29 ‚Ä≤ 28"" N and 18¬∞29 ‚Ä≤ 25"" E to 18¬∞39 ‚Ä≤ 8"" E ( Fig.  | Data collection and preprocessing: This study analyzes the impact of LULC change on LST in Bangui city from 1986 to 2017. Different Landsat Products (Landsat 5 (Thematic Mapper (TM)) and Landsat 8 (Operational Land Imager (OLI)) were collected on the temporal resolution of 16 days and spatial resolution of 30 m for the period of 1986, 1999 and 2017 ( Table  | Conversion of digital number into radiance: The Landsat images were downloaded as raw data (digital numbers) which needs to be converted to spectral radiances (L ùúÜ) by using the information in the Landsat metadata header file 
Where: ùêø ùúÜ is the spectral radiance (Wm -2 sr -1 Œºm -1) , LMAX ùúÜ is the spectral radiance scaled to Q Calmax (W m -2 sr -1 ùúám -1 ). LMIN ùúÜ is the spectral radiance scaled to Q Calmin (W m -2 sr -1 ùúám -1 ). Q Calmax is the maximum quantized calibrated pixel value (DN = 255) that corresponds to LMAX ùúÜ . The minimum quantized calibrated pixel value (DN = 0) corresponds to LMIN ùúÜ . Q Cal is the quantized calibrated pixel value (DN). | Conversion from radiance to reflectance: The radiances calculated using Eq. ( 
Where: ùëü is the planetary reflectance (dimensionless), L ùúÜ is the spectral radiance at the sensor aperture (W m -2 sr -1 ùúám -1 ), dr = 1 + 0.033cos ( D √ó 2 √ó 3.14)/365), where D is the day of the year, E sun is the mean solar atmospheric irradiance (W m -2 ùúám -1 ), ùúÉ is the solar zenith angle (degree), ùúÉ = (90 -B), and B is the Sun elevation angle. dr is the inverse square of the earth-sun distance (astronomical unit). | Retrieval Land Surface Temperature (LST): In this study, LST was derived from thermal bands of Landsat products using the methodology recommended by 
Where: K1 and K2 are the conversions constant, L ùúÜ is a spectral radiance and T is brightness temperature. For Landsat 8 OLI, K1 = 774.8853 Kelvin and K2 = 1321.0789 Kelvin; for Landsat 7 ETM + , K1 = 666.09 Kelvin and K2 = 1282.71 Kelvin; and Landsat 5 TM, K1 = 607.76 Kelvin and K2 = 1260.56 Kelvin.
In the second step, LST was derived using the following relation 
Where: ùúÜ ( ‚âà 11.5 Œºm) is the effective wavelength of thermal bands. P = h ùëê ùúé = 1.438 √ó 10 2 mK, where ' ùúé' is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 √ó 10-23 JK-1), h is Planck constant (6.626 √ó 10-34 Js) and c is the speed of light (3.0 √ó 108 ms -1 ), ùúñ is the land surface emissivity with 0.95, 0.92 and 0.9925 for vegetation, build-up and water surfaces, respectively 
Where: ùëë ùúÄ = geometrical distribution of the surface; ùúÄ ùë£ = vegetation emissivity; ∆ê s = the soil emissivity; F = shape factor and its value is 0.55; P v = vegetation proportion and it was obtained according to Eq. 6 (   Then land surface emissivity was retrieved using equation 7. | Calculation of spectral indices: The NDVI is widely used as the vegetation indicator by combining the reflectance of two-channels which sensitive to vegetation feature, including red band (RED) and near-infrared band (NIR). The NDVI ranges from -1 to + 1. The NDVI is expressed in the following equation 
Where: ùúå Mir and ùúå Nir correspond to the reflectance of Middle-infrared and Near-infrared bands of Landsat images, respectively. The NDLI has been proven as an effective indicator in assessing the potential evapotranspiration of the surface. The advantage of the NDLI is its uniqueness in optimizing the spectral sensitivity on biophysical land surface parameters by incorporating three commonly channels chosen by the satellite missions, including Green, Red, and Shortwave-infrared. The NDLI is estimated by the equation below. | ùëÅùê∑ ùêøùêº =: ùúå ùê∫ ùëüùëíùëíùëõ -ùúå Re ùëë ùúå ùê∫ ùëüùëíùëíùëõ + ùúå Re ùëë + ùúå ùëÄùëñùëü  | Preparation of land use land-cover classes: After radiance was converted to reflectance in Eq. 2 , LULC classes were extracted for the period 1986, 1999 and 2017 by applying maxi-mum likelihood supervised classification. Supervised classification was used to classify the pixels into different land use classes  | Statistical analysis: The study used Correlation coefficient (R) to assess the relationship between LST and NDVI, NDBI and NDLI of the study area of each year. The study was used three indices namely NDVI, NDBI and NDLI to characterize the surface and LST variations in Bangui city. These indices were used to establish quantifiable relationships with LST through the set of independent pixels chosen randomly within the entire study area. The statistical relationship was implemented using the Excel 2016 software package. | Results and discussion:  | Land-use/land-cover change from 1986 to 2017: Built up, vegetation, bare soil/ rock and water were the main LULC types found in Bangui city. The spatiotemporal distribution of LULC classes of the city in 1986, 1999 and 2017 are illustrated in Fig.  | Spatiotemporal distribution of LST and its variations with LULC types: Fig. 
The study confirmed that central areas of the city were exhibited high LST and it declined when moving away from the center. This is because of buildings and other impervious surface expansion  | Relationship of LST with NDVI, NDBI and NDLI: The study revealed that most places in the center of the city exhibited low NDVI values while peripheral areas and places covered with vegetation have high NDVI values ( Fig. 
The result of this study shows that there is a negative correlation between LST and NDVI ( r = -0.9191, -0.8117, and -0.7549 for 1986, 1999, and 2017, respectively) ( Fig.  | Conclusions: Land-cover types has been degraded from time to time and this degradation cause change in urban climate. Continuous and extreme land and environmental degradation, particularly affect LST in many cities in the world. So, monitoring LULC is very vital to understand trend of LST. In this regards, advanced remote sensing technology has been used for environmental resource monitoring and planning. The result of the study indicates that built-up areas were expanded from 1986 to 2017 whereas bare soil declined. Besides, the area of vegetation cover was somewhat increased from 1986 to 2017 due to the expansion of green space in the city. Though green areas were expanded in the city, the LST increasing from 1986 to 2017. The study revealed that the minimum, maximum and mean LST of the city increased during the study period. The study also stated that built-up and bare soil experienced higher LST than vegetation and water body. This study indicates that significant variations of LST related to the transformation of LULC in Bangui city originating from the urbanization process. The study found a positive correlation between NDBI and LST whereas negative correlations between LST and NDVI and NDLI. Therefore, to mitigate the impact of LULC change on LST the city planner and administrator should work on different landscape planning on ecological and biodiversity perspectives.

Assessment of land use/land cover changes and their impacts on land surface temperature in Bangui (the capital of Central African Republic),Mamadou Traore; Mai Lee; Azad Rasul; Abel Balew,"Extreme land-use and land-cover (LULC) as the result of rapid urbanization has been raising land surface temperature of core city areas and its surrounding. Therefore, investigation on surface temperature is very vital to analyze temperature variations and minimize its effect. This research aims to analyze the impacts of LULC changes on LST in Bangui city, Central African Republic using combined techniques of remote sensing and GIS. The result of this study indicates that there was a significant change in LULC between 1986 and 2017 particularly expanded in vegetation and built-up areas and declined in bare soil. For instance, built-up increased by + 130.29 % with a rate of 137.06; and vegetation increased by 8.44% or a rate of 17.2. Whereas bare soil was sharply declined by -35.33% for a rate of -155.83. The mean LST of the city firstly decreased from 26.24 ¬∞C in 1986 to 23.37 ¬∞C  in 1999 and increased to 27.23 ¬∞C in 2017.  The study also stated that the mean LST of built-up areas increased from 26.21 ¬∞C in 1986 to 27.59 ¬∞C in 2017. Besides, the mean LST of bare soil raised from 26.51 ¬∞C to 27.33 ¬∞C in 1986 and 2017 respectively. These indicate that built up and bare soil experienced high LST than vegetation and water body. The study found a positive correlation between NDBI and LST whereas negative correlations of LST with NDVI and NDLI. City planners should be implemented urban green belts and green roof to mitigate the effect of surface urban heat islands (SUHI) in the city and its surooundings.","Introduction: Currently, many regions around the globe under different environmental conditions are facing dramatic changes in LULC 
Over time, land-use change maps provide essential information for land-use planning 
Though several studies have been done in different regions of the world, yet the problem of urban climate change mainly SUHI effects is the burning issue of world cities. This initiate to conduct the study and to provide information for city planners about LULC change and its impact on LST. The study has the objective to examine the impacts of LULC changes on LST in Bangui city from 1986 to 2017 using Landsat images. Therefore, the study is very essential for city planners, municipality experts, as well as other higher officials since the results of the study provide significant information about the trend of LULC change and its impact on LST and enable to impliment SUHI mitigation measures. | Material and methods:  | Study area: Geographically, Bangui city is located in between 4¬∞18 ‚Ä≤ 9"" N to 4¬∞29 ‚Ä≤ 28"" N and 18¬∞29 ‚Ä≤ 25"" E to 18¬∞39 ‚Ä≤ 8"" E ( Fig.  | Data collection and preprocessing: This study analyzes the impact of LULC change on LST in Bangui city from 1986 to 2017. Different Landsat Products (Landsat 5 (Thematic Mapper (TM)) and Landsat 8 (Operational Land Imager (OLI)) were collected on the temporal resolution of 16 days and spatial resolution of 30 m for the period of 1986, 1999 and 2017 ( Table  | Conversion of digital number into radiance: The Landsat images were downloaded as raw data (digital numbers) which needs to be converted to spectral radiances (L ùúÜ) by using the information in the Landsat metadata header file 
Where: ùêø ùúÜ is the spectral radiance (Wm -2 sr -1 Œºm -1) , LMAX ùúÜ is the spectral radiance scaled to Q Calmax (W m -2 sr -1 ùúám -1 ). LMIN ùúÜ is the spectral radiance scaled to Q Calmin (W m -2 sr -1 ùúám -1 ). Q Calmax is the maximum quantized calibrated pixel value (DN = 255) that corresponds to LMAX ùúÜ . The minimum quantized calibrated pixel value (DN = 0) corresponds to LMIN ùúÜ . Q Cal is the quantized calibrated pixel value (DN). | Conversion from radiance to reflectance: The radiances calculated using Eq. ( 
Where: ùëü is the planetary reflectance (dimensionless), L ùúÜ is the spectral radiance at the sensor aperture (W m -2 sr -1 ùúám -1 ), dr = 1 + 0.033cos ( D √ó 2 √ó 3.14)/365), where D is the day of the year, E sun is the mean solar atmospheric irradiance (W m -2 ùúám -1 ), ùúÉ is the solar zenith angle (degree), ùúÉ = (90 -B), and B is the Sun elevation angle. dr is the inverse square of the earth-sun distance (astronomical unit). | Retrieval Land Surface Temperature (LST): In this study, LST was derived from thermal bands of Landsat products using the methodology recommended by 
Where: K1 and K2 are the conversions constant, L ùúÜ is a spectral radiance and T is brightness temperature. For Landsat 8 OLI, K1 = 774.8853 Kelvin and K2 = 1321.0789 Kelvin; for Landsat 7 ETM + , K1 = 666.09 Kelvin and K2 = 1282.71 Kelvin; and Landsat 5 TM, K1 = 607.76 Kelvin and K2 = 1260.56 Kelvin.
In the second step, LST was derived using the following relation 
Where: ùúÜ ( ‚âà 11.5 Œºm) is the effective wavelength of thermal bands. P = h ùëê ùúé = 1.438 √ó 10 2 mK, where ' ùúé' is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 √ó 10-23 JK-1), h is Planck constant (6.626 √ó 10-34 Js) and c is the speed of light (3.0 √ó 108 ms -1 ), ùúñ is the land surface emissivity with 0.95, 0.92 and 0.9925 for vegetation, build-up and water surfaces, respectively 
Where: ùëë ùúÄ = geometrical distribution of the surface; ùúÄ ùë£ = vegetation emissivity; ∆ê s = the soil emissivity; F = shape factor and its value is 0.55; P v = vegetation proportion and it was obtained according to Eq. 6 (   Then land surface emissivity was retrieved using equation 7. | Calculation of spectral indices: The NDVI is widely used as the vegetation indicator by combining the reflectance of two-channels which sensitive to vegetation feature, including red band (RED) and near-infrared band (NIR). The NDVI ranges from -1 to + 1. The NDVI is expressed in the following equation 
Where: ùúå Mir and ùúå Nir correspond to the reflectance of Middle-infrared and Near-infrared bands of Landsat images, respectively. The NDLI has been proven as an effective indicator in assessing the potential evapotranspiration of the surface. The advantage of the NDLI is its uniqueness in optimizing the spectral sensitivity on biophysical land surface parameters by incorporating three commonly channels chosen by the satellite missions, including Green, Red, and Shortwave-infrared. The NDLI is estimated by the equation below. | ùëÅùê∑ ùêøùêº =: ùúå ùê∫ ùëüùëíùëíùëõ -ùúå Re ùëë ùúå ùê∫ ùëüùëíùëíùëõ + ùúå Re ùëë + ùúå ùëÄùëñùëü  | Preparation of land use land-cover classes: After radiance was converted to reflectance in Eq. 2 , LULC classes were extracted for the period 1986, 1999 and 2017 by applying maxi-mum likelihood supervised classification. Supervised classification was used to classify the pixels into different land use classes  | Statistical analysis: The study used Correlation coefficient (R) to assess the relationship between LST and NDVI, NDBI and NDLI of the study area of each year. The study was used three indices namely NDVI, NDBI and NDLI to characterize the surface and LST variations in Bangui city. These indices were used to establish quantifiable relationships with LST through the set of independent pixels chosen randomly within the entire study area. The statistical relationship was implemented using the Excel 2016 software package. | Results and discussion:  | Land-use/land-cover change from 1986 to 2017: Built up, vegetation, bare soil/ rock and water were the main LULC types found in Bangui city. The spatiotemporal distribution of LULC classes of the city in 1986, 1999 and 2017 are illustrated in Fig.  | Spatiotemporal distribution of LST and its variations with LULC types: Fig. 
The study confirmed that central areas of the city were exhibited high LST and it declined when moving away from the center. This is because of buildings and other impervious surface expansion  | Relationship of LST with NDVI, NDBI and NDLI: The study revealed that most places in the center of the city exhibited low NDVI values while peripheral areas and places covered with vegetation have high NDVI values ( Fig. 
The result of this study shows that there is a negative correlation between LST and NDVI ( r = -0.9191, -0.8117, and -0.7549 for 1986, 1999, and 2017, respectively) ( Fig.  | Conclusions: Land-cover types has been degraded from time to time and this degradation cause change in urban climate. Continuous and extreme land and environmental degradation, particularly affect LST in many cities in the world. So, monitoring LULC is very vital to understand trend of LST. In this regards, advanced remote sensing technology has been used for environmental resource monitoring and planning. The result of the study indicates that built-up areas were expanded from 1986 to 2017 whereas bare soil declined. Besides, the area of vegetation cover was somewhat increased from 1986 to 2017 due to the expansion of green space in the city. Though green areas were expanded in the city, the LST increasing from 1986 to 2017. The study revealed that the minimum, maximum and mean LST of the city increased during the study period. The study also stated that built-up and bare soil experienced higher LST than vegetation and water body. This study indicates that significant variations of LST related to the transformation of LULC in Bangui city originating from the urbanization process. The study found a positive correlation between NDBI and LST whereas negative correlations between LST and NDVI and NDLI. Therefore, to mitigate the impact of LULC change on LST the city planner and administrator should work on different landscape planning on ecological and biodiversity perspectives. The landscape planning of the city should also focus on the techniques of regulating the effects of SUHI. The city administra-tor should also work to increase urban green belts and green roof mechanisms.","Land use change modeling and the effect of compact city paradigms: integration of GIS-based cellular automata and weights-of-evidence techniques (, , 2018) || Land use and land cover changes and associated driving forces in north western lowlands of Ethiopia (, , , , 2015) || Influence of urbanization-driven land use/cover change on climate: the case of Addis Ababa (, , , , 2018) || Analysis of maximum likelihood classification on multispectral data (, 2012) || Monitoring land surface temperature in Bahir Dar City and its surrounding using Landsat images (, , 2020) || Change detection analysis of land use by using geospatial techniques: a case study of Faisalabad-Pakistan (, , , , , 2012) || Mapping urbanization in the United States from 2001 to 2011 (, , , , , 2018) || Summary of current radiometric calibration coefficients for Landsat MSS, TM, ETM + , and EO-1 ALI sensors (, , , 2009) || Remote sensing image-based analysis of the relationship between urban heat island and land use/cover changes (, , , , 2006) || Using remote sensing and GIS to detect and monitor land use and land cover change in Dhaka Metropolitan of Bangladesh during 1960-2005 (, , 2009) || Impact of landscape structure on the variation of land surface temperature in sub-saharan region: a case study of Addis Ababa using Landsat data (, , , , 2019. 1986-2016) || Land-use/land-cover changes and their impact on surface urban heat islands: case study of Kandy City (, , , , 2019) || Spatio-temporal modelling of informal settlement development in Sancaktepe district (, , , 2011) || Effects of urban tree canopy loss on land surface temperature magnitude and timing (, , , , , , 2017) || A generalized single-channel method for retrieving land surface temperature from remote sensing data (, , 2003) || Impact of urbanization and land-use change on climate (, , 2003. 2003) || Spatio-temporal assessment of drought in Ethiopia and the impact of recent intense droughts (, , 2019) || Quantifying spatial-temporal pattern of urban heat Island in Beijing: an improved assessment using land surface temperature (LST) time series observations from LANDSAT, MODIS, and Chinese New Satellite GaoFen-1 (, , , , , , 2015) || Exploring the potential climate change impact on urban growth in London by a cellular automata-based Markov chain model (, , , , , , , 2018) || Detection and prediction of land use/land cover change using spatiotemporal data fusion and the Cellular Automata-Markov model (, , , , 2019) || Urban Mobility in the 1st Century (, , 2012) || Spatiotemporal urbanization processes in the megacity of Mumbai, India: a Markov chains-cellular automata urban growth model (, , 2013) || Quantification of the land use/land cover dynamics and the degree of urban growth goodness for sustainable urban land use planning in Addis Ababa and the surrounding Oromia special zone (, , 2019) || The relationship between vegetation dynamics and land surface temperature by using different satellite imageries;

Assessment of land use land cover change and its effects using artificial neural network-based cellular automation,Nishant Mehra; Janaki Swain,"The challenge of urban growth and land use land cover (LULC) change is particularly critical in developing countries. The use of remote sensing and GIS has helped to generate LULC thematic maps, which have proven immensely valuable in resource and land-use management, facilitating sustainable development by balancing developmental interests and conservation measures. The research utilized socioeconomic and spatial variables such as slope, elevation, distance from streams, distance from roads, distance from built-up areas, and distance from the center of town to determine their impact on the LULC of 2016 and 2019. The research integrates Artificial Neural Network with Cellular Automta to forecast and establish potential land use changes for the years 2025 and 2040. Comparison between the predicted and actual LULC maps of 2022 indicates high agreement with kappa hat of 0.77 and a percentage of correctness of 86.83%. The study indicates that the built-up area will increase by 8.37 km 2 by 2040, resulting in a reduction of 7.08 km 2 and 1.16 km 2 in protected and agricultural areas, respectively. These findings will assist urban planners and lawmakers to adopt management and conservation strategies that balance urban expansion and conservation of natural resources leading to the sustainable development of the cities.","Introduction: The demographic projections suggest that the Central and Southern Asia are poised to emerge as the world's most populous region by 2037 
The significant characteristics of urban sprawl are a rapid decrease in vegetated areas 
The integrated use of remote sensing and GIS has helped immensely in the management of land and natural resources and in understanding the complex linkages between spatial patterns and processes responsible for change 
Cellular automata (CA)-based models are spatially explicit models (SEM) that work on a simple premise that the future state of a land cover type is dependent on the past local interactions between the different land covers 
To address the inherent constraints in the individual models, various researchers have employed hybrid models like CA-Markov model 
The study aims to model LULC change using MLP-ANN and cellular automation simulation in the city of Dharamshala, one of the fastest-growing cities in the state of Himachal Pradesh, India. The results are expected to act as a road map for urban planners and policymakers for sustainable development of the city. The research used the MOLUSCE plugin, as a tool to predict and assess the transformations occurring in each LULC type in the study area. In the study, LULC maps of 2016 and 2019 were used as independent variables in the model to simulate and validate the LULC map of 2022, and thereafter, LULC maps of 2025 and 2040 were predicted. | Study area: The research locale encompasses Dharamshala, situated in the state of Himachal Pradesh, India, as illustrated in Fig. 
The city is the winter capital of the state of Himachal Pradesh and the headquarters of the Central Tibetan Administration. The city is a famous hill station destination, both for national and international visitors. Further, it is also the administrative headquarters of Kangra district. The city was declared a municipal corporation in the year 2015 by merging 9 adjacent villages and has ever since witnessed rapid urbanization. It is one among the 100 cities in India and the only city in the state of Himachal Pradesh chosen in the year 2016 to be developed under the National Smart Cities Mission by the Government of India.
A dramatic rise in urban spaces has been witnessed in the city from the year 2016 onwards, and there exists an inherent imperative to address the recent alterations that have manifested within this geographical area through a scientific lens. The time scale chosen in the study corresponds to the maximum socio-economic changes occurring in the city due to the formation of municipal limits, hosting of international cricket matches and also serving as the residence of His Holiness Dalai Lama. | Methods: The simulation's correctness is determined by the quality of the data and criteria used in the investigation 
The study incorporated LULC maps of 2016, 2019, and 2022 and digital elevation model (DEM), the details of which are given in Table 
The riverine sources, in this part of the Himalayan region, are characterized by the presence of boulders and cobbles, and thus, the chances of overlapping spectral characteristics for the built-up areas and water bodies were likely. The Strahler order algorithm available in SAGA was used to accurately delineate the water bodies.
Various researchers have included slope, elevation, and aspect, as geospatial parameters; population density as the socio-economic parameter; and spatial variables such as distance from the water bodies, roads, built-up areas, and from the center of town for simulation 
The methodological workflow for the area under investigation is summarized in Fig. 
The transition probabilities derived from MLP-ANN learning processes are fed into CA to predict and estimate the LULC changes in this hybrid model of CA-ANN  | Image pre-processing: The satellite imageries of 2016, 2019, and 2022 were transformed to spectral radiance values, and the Dark Object Subtraction (DOS) in the semi-automatic classification (SCP) plugin in QGIS was used for performing atmospheric correction. Thereafter, the images were mosaicked, and an image subset was performed using the shapefile of the municipal corporation limits of Dharamshala city. The shape file of municipal limits was geometrically corrected with the use of ground control points (GCP) selected using GPS. This was executed in a manner that ensured the Root mean Squared Error (RMSE) attained a value of less than half of a pixel  | Inputs: The LULC maps for 2016 and 2019 are taken as input and establish the spatio-temporal dynamics of the region. The MOLUSCE plugin was used to create a transition map between 2016 and 2019 showing the percentage change occurring in each of the five land cover types for the period from 2016 to 2019.
For using the CA model, the region should be a discrete grided area, with each cell specifying a land cover type. The driving factors could be categorized as having different spatial attributes, such as distance parameters, physical properties, and neighborhood relationships 
The transition functions are non-linear and represent the relationship between driving factors and transformation probabilities of land cover type 
Based on spatio-temporal dynamics and the impact of driving factors, the simulation is initially performed for the year 2022, and based on the performance of the model, the predictions are thereafter made for the years 2025 and 2040 in the iterative steps of two and six, respectively, in the model. | Evaluating correlation and transition analysis: The examination of correlation among the driving factors was executed using the Cramer coefficient, also known as the Cramer V method, particularly suitable for contingency tables larger than 2 √ó 2. The outcomes span a range of 0 to 1, where elevated values signify a heightened correlation amid the driving factors. A coefficient surpassing 0.15 indicates a substantial explanatory potency of variables 
The changes (in area and percentage) occurring in the land cover classes for the period 2016 to 2019 are shown in Table  | Transition potential modeling: The transformations occurring in a region are a highly complex process dependent on spatio-temporal changes and driving factors responsible for the changes  | Validation: In LULC simulation, the cross-tabulation matrix, also referred to as a contingency table, error matrix, or confusion matrix, stands as an extensively utilized approach for the evaluation of outcomes 
Several simulations with different combinations of exploratory maps were performed, as shown in Table  | Results and discussion: The LULC distribution for the years 2016, 2019, and 2022 is shown in Table 
The region lying at an altitude of less than 1500 m remained the most critical with maximum changes in LULC classes being witnessed there. The built-up areas, agricultural  areas, and protected areas showed maximum transition in this region. The main reason for this could be attributed to the better transportation facilities, road connectivity, suitable climatic conditions for living and agricultural practices, commercial establishments, and more population concentration in this region. Higher altitude regions, because of terrain and other geographical constraints, are less vulnerable to built-up areas. Thus, the city requires greater concern and attention from policymakers and environmentalists to pave the way for a balanced, holistic, and sustainable development model. The simulation and accurate prediction of LULC become necessary to understand the trend and direction of urban sprawl. The LULC maps of 2025 and 2040 were prepared using CA modeling, and the spatial distribution of these LULC maps is shown in Fig. 
The LULC change analysis of the maps from 2016 to 2025 and 2016 to 2040 is shown in Tables 
The swift expansion of urbanized regions, stemming from demographic expansion and the influx of tourists, emphasizes the critical significance of implementing sustainable urban planning strategies. Effective land-use management strategies should be implemented by policymakers and urban planners involving the promotion of efficient land use, reducing urban sprawl, and preserving green spaces, contributing to the attainment of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, which focuses on creating sustainable cities and communities.
The decline in protected areas is a matter of concern as it poses a threat to biodiversity and ecosystems. Strict implementation of legislation, with the involvement of environmentalists and policymakers, can help protect and restore these areas, thus preserving biodiversity and ensuring the long-term sustainability of natural resources. This effort directly relates to SDG 15, which focuses on maintaining and enhancing life on land.
Land-use planning plays a crucial role in fostering responsible consumption and production patterns. By optimizing land use and preventing further encroachment on protected areas, policymakers can contribute to sustainable resource management and reduce the environmental impact of human activities, which aligns with the objectives of SDG 12, aiming to ensure responsible consumption and production.
The increasing population and tourists will remain the major driving factors for the change. The decrease in agricultural areas indicates a shift in agriculture practice, which lately has been the preferred occupation of the residents. Further, the decrease in protected areas indicates the persistent encroachments and abeyance of legislation. In order to address the decreasing agricultural areas, it is crucial to promote sustainable farming practices and increase agricultural productivity to address the escalating requirements of sustenance. This can be accomplished through the implementation of innovative techniques, support for small-scale farmers, and ensuring food security for all, thereby working towards achieving Zero Hunger (SDG-2). | Conclusions: The study applied ANN-based CA approach for prediction of land cover classes which showed substantial agreement between the simulated and the actual LULC map, with the accuracy metric kappa showing a value of 0.77. The model incorporated six driving factors, out of which four were socio-economic spatial parameters, distance from builtup areas, roads, center of town, and streams; while two were geospatial parameters, elevation, and slope. These criteria combinations performed the best in the CA-ANN model showing the highest value of accuracy of 86.83%. The selection of these factors was based on their potential influence on the study's outcomes. For instance, proximity to built-up areas may impact pollution levels and development rates, while distance from roads may correlate with traffic noise and urbanization patterns. Elevation and slope could affect water resource accessibility, and proximity to streams might indicate water source quality.
The study predicts that the built-up areas will increase by 17.84% in the year 2025 and 19.69% by the year 2040. The protected areas will decrease by 14.75% and 16.66%, agricultural areas by 2.81% and 2.72%, and barren land by 0.29% and 0.31% for the years 2025 and 2040, respectively. The rapid increase in population and tourism has led to a significant rise in built-up areas, creating an urgent demand for more land and putting undue pressure on protected areas and agricultural areas. Strict implementation of legislation is necessary to prevent further encroachments in the protected areas. Studying the critical land-use classes in terms of socio-ecological and environmental concerns is valuable for balancing environmental pressures and conservation interventions. The findings can offer guidance to administrators, policymakers, agricultural practitioners, and urban planners in formulating methodologies for sustainable land-use planning and management, fostering the optimal utilization of natural resources.","World population prospects (, , , , , 2022) || India overtakes China as the world's most populous country (, , , 2023) || Monitoring and modelling of urban sprawl using remote sensing and GIS techniques (, , , 2008) || Land use/land cover modeling of Sagar Island, India using remote sensing and GIS techniques (, , , , , 2019) || Assessment of land use/land cover dynamics vis-√†-vis hydrometeorological variability in Wular Lake environs Kashmir Valley, India using multitemporal satellite data (, , 2014) || Land use/land cover change assessment of Halda watershed using remote sensing and GIS (, , , 2020) || Monitoring land use/cover change using remote sensing and GIS techniques: a case study of Hawalbagh block, district Almora (, , 2015) || Visualization of urban growth pattern in Chennai using geoinformatics and spatial metrics (, , 2016) || Urban expansion and loss of agricultural land-a GIS based study of Saharanpur City (, 2000) || Study on land-use and land-cover change dynamics in Eastern Arunachal Pradesh, NE India using remote sensing and GIS (, , , , 2019) || Application of GIS for land-use/land-cover change analysis in a mountainous terrain (, , , , , 1996) || Land-cover change analysis of Garur Ganga watershed using GIS/remote sensing technique (, , 2001) || Assessing different remote sensing techniques to detect land use/cover changes in the eastern Mediterranean (, , 2009) || Monitoring urban growth and land use change detection with GIS and remote sensing techniques in Daqahlia governorate Egypt (, , 2015) || Monitoring and predicting land use and land cover changes using remote sensing and GIS techniques-a case study of a hilly area (, , , 2018) || Analyses of land use and land cover change dynamics using GIS and remote sensing during 1984 and 2015 in the Beressa Watershed Northern Central Highland of Ethiopia (, , , 2016) || Study of urban heat island effect on Ahmedabad City and its relationship with urbanization and vegetation parameters (, , , , , 2015) || Spatiotemporal change analysis and prediction of future land use and land cover changes using QGIS MOLUSCE Plugin and Remote Sensing Big Data: a case study of Linyi (, , , , , 2022) || Prevalent vegetation growth enhancement in urban environment (, , , 2016) || Land cover classification using IRS LISS III image and DEM in a rugged terrain: a case study in Himalayas (, , , , 2005) || Land use and land cover change detection and prediction in the Kathmandu district of Nepal using remote sensing and GIS (, , , , , 2020) || Improving land-use change modeling by integrating ANN with cellular automata-Markov chain model (, , , , 2020) || Land use and land cover change and its resultant erosion susceptible level: an appraisal using RUSLE and logistic regression in a tropical plateau basin of West Bengal (, , , , 2021) || From pattern to process: landscape fragmentation and the analysis of land use/land cover change (, , , 2004) || Post-classification corrections in improving the classification of land use/land cover of arid region using RS and GIS: the case of Arjuni watershed (, , , , 2017) || The simulation and prediction of spatio-temporal urban growth trends using cellular automata models: a review (, , , , 2016) || A review of assessment methods for cellular automata models of land-use change and urban growth (, , 2020) || Image classification in remote sensing (, , , , 2013) || Classification of imbalanced remote-sensing data by neural networks (, , 1997) || Modeling and simulating land use/cover change using artificial neural network from remotely sensing data (, , 2019) || Remote sensing approach to simulate the land use/land cover and seasonal land surface temperature change using machine learning algorithms in a fastest-growing megacity of Bangladesh (, , , , , , , , , 2021) || Cellular automata as models of complexity (, 1984) || Research article modelling inside GIS: part 1.

"Vegetation Trends, Drought Severity and Land Use-Land Cover Change during the Growing Season in Semi-Arid Contexts",Felicia Akinyemi,"Drought severity and impact assessments are necessary to effectively monitor droughts in semi-arid contexts. However, little is known about the influence land use-land cover (LULC) has-in terms of the differences in annual sizes and configurations-on drought effects. Coupling remote sensing and Geographic Information System techniques, drought evolution was assessed and mapped. During the growing season, drought severity and the effects on LULC were examined and whether these differed between areas of land change and persistence. This study used areas of economic importance to Botswana as case studies. Vegetation Condition Index, derived from Normalised Difference Vegetation Index time series for the growing seasons (2000-2018 in  comparison to 2020-2021), was used to assess droughts for 17 constituencies (Botswana's fourth administrative level) in the Central District of Botswana. Further analyses by LULC types and land change highlighted the vulnerability of both human and natural systems to drought. Identified drought periods in the time series correspond to declared drought years by the Botswana government. Drought severity (extreme, severe, moderate and mild) and the percentage of land areas affected varied in both space and time. The growing seasons of 2002-2003, 2003-2004 and 2015-2016  were the most drought-stricken in the entire time series, coinciding with the El Ni√±o southern oscillation (ENSO). The lower-than-normal vegetation productivity during these growing seasons was evident from the analysis. With the above-normal vegetation productivity in the ongoing season (2020-2021), the results suggest the reversal of the negative vegetation trends observed in the preceding growing seasons. However, the extent of this reversal cannot be confidently ascertained with the season still ongoing. Relating drought severity and intensities to LULC and change in selected drought years revealed that most lands affected by extreme and severe drought (in descending order) were in tree-covered areas (forests and woodlands), grassland/rangelands and croplands. These LULC types were the most affected as extreme drought intersected vegetation productivity decline. The most impacted constituencies according to drought severity and the number of drought events were Mahalapye west (eight), Mahalapye east (seven) and Boteti west (seven). Other constituencies experienced between six and two drought events of varying durations throughout the time series. Since not all constituencies were affected similarly during declared droughts, studies such as this contribute to devising appropriate context-specific responses aimed at minimising drought impacts on social-ecological systems. The methodology utilised can apply to other drylands where climatic and socioeconomic contexts are similar to those of Botswana.","Introduction: Drought as a slow-onset event is increasingly an environmental hazard due to its negative impacts on natural and human systems, including livelihoods  | Materials and Methods:  | Description of the Study Location: Seventeen constituencies in the Central District of Botswana (CDB) in the eastern part of the country were used as case studies (Figure 
based resources upon which much of livelihoods are dependent would either be exacerbated or ameliorated depending on how the land is put to use and the land management practices. To better demonstrate RS capabilities for assessing drought severity at a finer, sub-national scale, the assessment was conducted in 17 constituencies (a constituency is the fourth administrative level in Botswana). | Materials and Methods:  | Description of the Study Location: Seventeen constituencies in the Central District of Botswana (CDB) in the eastern part of the country were used as case studies (Figure 
The district is of great economic importance to Botswana, with 23% (31,634 holdings) of all traditional agricultural holdings in Botswana  | Data Sources: Variability in vegetation condition and drought severity in the CDB were examined over 18 years using the 1 km Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) decadal (i.e., 10-day composite) image time series from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (https://land.copernicus.eu/global/products/ndvi, accessed on 8 January 2021). These images were made available through the European Union-African Union-funded project on Monitoring for environment and security in Africa (MESA). The MESA was implemented for the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region comprising 15 countries and included Madagascar and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The dekadal NDVI datasets from October 2000 to 2014 were derived from SPOT VGT, and data from June 2014 to 2018 are from the PROBA-V 
The land cover datasets were from the European Space Agency (ESA-LC) Climate Change Initiative (CCI-LC v.2.0.7) ESA CCI and Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S-LC Mv52 https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-land-cover?tab= form, accessed on 8 January 2021). These datasets are a consistent series of multi-sensor annual maps from 1992 to 2018  | Methods:  | Indicators of Vegetation Variability: Indices used for measuring vegetation variability and drought severity are based on the NDVI. NDVI is widely utilised for assessing and monitoring vegetation greenness, net primary productivity, plant phenology and land degradation in natural and human systems 
Three indicators of vegetation variability utilised in this study were derived from NDVI-NDVI difference, NDVI anomaly and NDVI trends. Other derived metrics to gauge seasonal vegetation productivity include the NDVI mean, maximum and cumulative values computed for each month in the growing season within the time series. | NDVI Difference: To analyse the variability of vegetation during the vegetation growing season over the 18-year study period, the NDVI Difference (NDVI diff ) function implemented in the MESA Drought Monitoring Services (DMS) software was utilised. NDVI diff is widely used to get an indication of vegetation state over a specific period by comparing vegetation productivity between two dekads or relative to the long-term average for the same period. This indicator highlights areas where vegetation is under stress as well as those performing well. For this study, seasonal NDVI diff was calculated for every growing season (i.e., annually) as the difference between the start dekad (i.e., first 10-day period) in October (D1) in a certain year i to the end dekad (i.e., last 10-day period) in March (D3) of the following year i + 1 in the time series data of 2000 to 2018 (Equation (2)):
Standardised NDVI Anomalies NDVI anomaly captures how vegetation productivity for a certain period deviates from the long-term average dynamics. It is calculated by subtracting the considered month NDVI from the month's long-term average and dividing it by the monthly standard deviation for that period. By distinguishing areas that are normal from those that are above or below normal vegetation productivity, NDVI anomaly is helpful to identify outliers, isolate the variability in the vegetation signal and consider the reviewed period within a meaningful historical context  | NDVI Trend: Using the NDVI time series of 2000 to 2020 as input, we computed vegetation change as trends and their significance based on the Mann-Kendall (MK) non-parametric test. Non-parametric approaches estimate trends in a time series by quantifying the rate of change in vegetation greenness for each pixel and characterises trends in the data using the median slope  | Drought Indicators Vegetation Condition Index: Drought severity during the growing season was measured using the NDVI-based Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) as in Equation (3) 
VCI is particularly useful for agriculture, as it assesses changes in NDVI through time since vegetation is water-stressed due to water deficiency such as during drought. VCI for the vegetation growing season was calculated between 2000-2001 and 2017-2018 starting with the first dekad of October in the previous year to the third dekad in March of the following year. VCI is measured as a percentage with values ranging between 0 (lowest) and 100 (highest), with values equal to or below 40% considered as drought to varying degrees of severity (Table  | Drought Intensity: Drought intensities for each growing season were calculated through the 18-year study period. These are percentages of pixels (a proxy for the surface land area) whose VCI values fell within the different drought severity and non-drought categories  | Drought Frequency: To relate the pixel-level VCI to each of the 17 constituencies in the CDB, the zonal statistics function in GIS was used. The median VCI value within each constituency was utilised because there is the tendency for more years in drylands to have rainfall below the mean, with the median value deviating more from the mean. Due to the sensitivity of the mean to outliers, the median is a better data distribution measure to gain further insight regarding the frequency of droughts in each constituency. Drought severity was compared to the official declarations of drought years by the government. Drought frequency was computed as the count of the number of drought years in the entire time series (growing seasons 2000-2001 to 2017-2018). A year with an annual VCI value of 40 or less is identified as drought-stricken and the sum of such drought years per constituency in the entire time series amounts to the frequency of drought  | Land Use-Land Cover Change: In addition to vegetation trends, drought severity was examined according to LULC types. It was also examined at the constituency level, to take into cognisance the environmental and administrative basis of drought impacts, respectively. For each drought year, drought severity effects on each LULC type were assessed based on the intersection of VCI and LULC values for that particular year. Drought intensity is expressed as a percentage of the area under each LULC type affected by varying drought severity and non-drought conditions. Percentages of the surface land area affected were then normalised by the size of the LULC type for each year. Since LULC configurations and sizes vary from one year to another, the annual LULC map for each identified drought year was utilised. Only for the land change analysis aspect was the maps of the years 2000 and 2018 used for post-classification change detection. | Results:  | Vegetation Variability and Trend: The spatial and temporal variations in vegetation productivity were presented based on analyses during the growing seasons, i.e., October to March, of the 18 years. Providing insights regarding each growing season throughout the entire time series, NDVI diff maps (Figure  | Spatio-Temporal Evolution of Drought Severity during Vegetation Growing Seasons: Drought negatively impacts vegetation growth, the supply of water for nature's needs (e.g., to sustain wildlife) and human needs (e.g., for livelihoods and food security). Seasonal maps depicting spatial and temporal variations in drought severity for the CDB were produced (Figure  | Spatio-Temporal Evolution of Drought Severity during Vegetation Growing Seasons: Drought negatively impacts vegetation growth, the supply of water for nature's needs (e.g., to sustain wildlife) and human needs (e.g., for livelihoods and food security). Seasonal maps depicting spatial and temporal variations in drought severity for the CDB were produced (Figure  | Area of Land Use-Land Cover Change and Persistence: In the CDB, areas of LULC persistence, i.e., unchanged, between 2000 to 2018 amounted to 88% (130,166 km 2 ).

Remote Sens. 2021, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 20 | Characterising Drought in the Constituencies:  | Drought Severity in Constituencies in Comparison with Drought Declaration: Drought and household food security vulnerability assessments are conducted annually during the mid-growing season in Botswana  | Discussion:  | Vegetation Condition Change and Drought Severity: There was high spatial and temporal variability in vegetation productivity during the growing seasons in the 18-year study period. This is typical of dryland ecosystems which are often non-equilibrium and dynamic in response to both climatic and anthropogenic perturbations 
Comparing vegetation productivity in the CDB during drought and non-drought years with the mean for the entire time series revealed the impacts droughts have on vegetation. For example, when compared to the mean, vegetation productivity was very limited in 2002-2003 (the worst drought episode in the time series). Drought occurrence was evident during the growing seasons of eight declared drought years in line with 
The lower than normal vegetation productivity during some of the drought-stricken growing seasons can be attributed to droughts linked to El Ni√±o southern oscillation (ENSO). For example, the prolonged droughts in the growing seasons of 2002-2004 and 2015-2016 coincided with the El Ni√±o years in the recent records 
Comparing the ongoing growing season (2020-2021) with the mean for the entire time series, we found above-normal vegetation productivity after mid-October 2020 until February 2021. Thus, this suggests the full recovery of vegetation productivity during this season from the impacts of the prolonged droughts in the last couple of growing seasons. However, this observation is somewhat fraught with uncertainty judging from the below-normal vegetation productivity at the start of the season. Moreover, the growing season has not ended yet. The growing season spanning the first dekad in October to the third dekad in March was chosen to align the cropping and the raining season in Botswana, which enabled the exclusion of the dry season from the drought analyses. | Vegetation Trend and Drought Severity by Land Use-Land Cover and Change: Many studies on droughts have not examined how drought effects differ between LULC types. For those that have land use incorporated, little is known of the influence of drought severity on LULC-in terms of the differences in annual sizes and configurationseither in changing and/or persistent areas. Processes driving decreasing vegetation trends, either climatic or anthropogenic, are better identified when LULC and change are incorporated in the examination of drought severity. For example, in CDB between 2000 and 2018, vegetation productivity declined in most forests, woodlands, croplands and grasslands. In land change areas, the trend of declining vegetation was equally high. In areas of persistence, the greatest percentage of improved vegetation productivity was in wetlands, settlements, and otherlands. Minimal improvement of vegetation trends in forested areas can be attributed to the overall increase in tree-covered areas during the study period.
Previous studies in dryland contexts such as Botswana and elsewhere associate the improvement in vegetation productivity partly to bush-encroachment which remote sensing vegetation indices capture as vegetation greening but bush-encroachment is undesirable in cattle-based systems 
Relating LULC change to land degradation, conversion of tree-covered areas to grassland, otherland and cropland, is degrading. This is because these land transitions drive the removal of vegetation cover and contribute to land degradation processes. Similarly considered as degrading land transitions are those involving the conversion of grasslands into croplands, artificial surface areas and otherlands. For example, in Palapye, the authors of 
Drought impacts on grasslands, forests and wetlands imply negative impacts on the cattle system and biodiversity, including wildlife in savannas with the associated tourism and hospitality sector, whereas effects on croplands impact food production. For example, the water crisis of 2015-2016 resulting from relatively low, erratic rainfalls reduced water levels and water inflows into dams drastically across the country  | Drought Severity in the Constituencies: Relating drought severity to the years declared as drought-stricken by the government, the results reveal that not all constituencies were equally affected by drought, as severity differed from severe to mild drought. Moreover, drought severities in some declared drought years were not as widespread in the CDB as in other parts of the country. For example, the growing season of the year 2009-2010 had improved vegetation productivity in response to above-normal rainfall recorded in previous months, which resulted in flooding events in five sub-districts in the CDB (Serowe/Palapye, Tutume, Boteti, Mahalapye and Bobirwa) 
Drought severity was further gauged by the frequency at the constituency level. Over the study period, the constituencies experienced between eight to two drought events. Examples are Mahalapye west and east, with eight and seven drought occurrences, respectively, ranging from moderate to mild drought. Boteti west experienced seven drought events with severity ranging from severe to mild. Confirming these drought frequencies in the CDB, the authors of  | Conclusions: This study proposed a spatial and temporal analysis of drought evolution in the Central District in eastern Botswana from 2000 to 2018. The results highlight the usefulness of incorporating land use-land cover and change in assessing the spatio-temporal variability of drought severity in drylands. Remote Sensing-based vegetation time series metrics were used, as complementary to climatological indices. Indicators characterising changes in vegetation conditions and drought severity during the growing seasons (October to March) from 2000-2001 to 2017-2018 were used. These indicators are NDVI difference-NDVI diff , NDVI anomaly, NDVI trends, Vegetation Condition Index-VCI, Drought intensity and frequency. The use of these different NDVI-based indicators, which might seem redundant, are useful as complementary measures since they differ computation-wise. The NDVI difference as utilised in this study captured the in-season variability in vegetation productivity, whereas the VCI compared each growing season with the long-term minimum and maximum conditions. For example, limited vegetation productivity found during the growing seasons of 2002-2004 and 2015-2016, which was based on both NDVI difference and NDVI anomalies, agreed with the heightened levels of drought severity over the same periods as derived from the VCI.
Results further showed high temporal and spatial variability in vegetation productivity between drought and non-drought conditions in our case studies. The associated negative impact of droughts on vegetation resulting in limited vegetation productivity was further confirmed by results from this study. Drought effects on vegetation productivity during the study period were characterised by decreasing vegetation trends in most parts of the district. Although varying intensities of drought severity (severe, moderate and mild) occurred in the constituencies, the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 growing seasons were found to be the worst drought periods in the entire series, as most parts of the district were affected. Assessing drought severity and intensities by LULC in selected drought years revealed varying drought effects. We found that drought effects differed between LULC types as well as whether these were areas of land change or persistence. Further examination of drought impacts in areas of no change is required, as our understanding of drought effects in areas with no change is still limited. More empirical studies in this regard will provide useful insights. Using the example of the 2002-2003 drought-stricken growing season, the highest percentage of land impacted by extreme and severe droughts were found in tree-covered areas, croplands and grasslands, whereas improved vegetation trends were found mostly in wetlands and some instances in otherland areas including barelands. Moreover, the results suggest that even in declared drought years, droughts severity varied, and the effects differed between constituencies. A further insight provided is that the magnitude of drought severity in some declared drought years was not as widespread in the CDB. For example, no other severe drought levels were recorded in the CDB after the extended drought which affected the growing seasons of 
Remote Sensing-based time series enabled us to extend the analysis up to the ongoing season, demonstrating its usefulness for better characterisation of drought events. Remote Sensing-based results such as those obtained in this study, when provided at multiple administrative scales in a timely and cost-effective manner, have the potential to aid decision-makers to better plan and respond to drought situations. Scientific evidence is needed as input into the decision-making process to aid national resource mobilisation for drought management. Botswana requires both proactive and reactive approaches for drought management, for which remote sensing-based assessment and monitoring foster the implementation of drought early warning systems. | Supplementary Materials:: The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4 292/13/5/836/s1, Table ","Evaluating the impact of drought using Remote Sensing in a Mediterranean, semi-arid region (, 2007) || Understanding the complex impacts of drought: A key to enhancing drought mitigation and preparedness (, , , 2007) || The role of drought among agro-pastoral communities in a semi-arid environment: The case of Botswana (, , , 2013) || Investigating relationship between drought severity in Botswana and ENSO (, , , , , 2020) || Potential impacts of global warming levels 1.5 ‚Ä¢ C and above on climate extremes in Botswana (, , 2019) || Drought Characteristics Assessment in Europe over the Past 50 Years (, , , , , 2020) || Global analysis of bioclimatic controls on ecosystem productivity using satellite observations of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (, , , , , ) || Consequences of widespread tree mortality triggered by drought and temperature stress (, , , 2013) || Drought severity in a changing climate (, , , 2017) || Assessing the response of vegetation photosynthesis to meteorological drought across northern China (, , , , 2021) || Positive feedback between future climate change and the carbon cycle (, , , , , , , , 2001) || Global warming and changes in drought (, , , , , , , 2014) || Observed drought indices show increasing divergence across (, , , , 2017, 7, 14045) || Pan-European seasonal trends and recent changes of drought frequency and severity (, , , 2017) || The southern African climate under 1.5 ‚Ä¢ C and 2 ‚Ä¢ C of global warming as simulated by CORDEX regional climate models (, , , , , , , , 2018) || Impacts of the 2017 flash drought in the US Northern Plains informed by satellite-based evapotranspiration and solar-induced fluorescence (, , , , , , , , , 2019) || Geosystems: An Introduction to Physical Geography (, 2013) || Rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns in South Africa's national parks (, , , , , 2016) || Projections of rapidly rising surface temperatures over Africa under low mitigation (, , , , , , , 2015) || The effects of 1.5 and 2 degrees of global warming on Africa in the CORDEX ensemble (, , , , , , , , , , 2018) || Climate change and variability in semi-arid Palapye; Eastern Botswana: An assessment from smallholder farmers' perspective (, 2017) || Rainfall variability and trends in semi-arid Botswana: Implications for climate change adaptation policy (, , 2010) || Relating the dynamics of climatological and hydrological droughts in semiarid Botswana (, , , 2018) || Prediction of onset and cessation of austral summer rainfall and dry spell frequency analysis in semiarid Botswana (, , , , 2018) || Temperature and precipitation extremes under current, 1.5 ‚Ä¢ C and 2.0 ‚Ä¢ C global warming above pre-industrial levels over Botswana, and implications for climate change vulnerability (, , , 2018) || Drought hazard in Kazakhstan in 2000-2016: A remote sensing perspective (, , , , , , 2019) || Global Drought Watch from space (, 1997) || Remote Sensing of Drought: Progress, Challenges and Opportunities (, , , , , , , 2015. 2014) || Remote Sensing of Drought: Vegetation, Soil Moisture, and Data Assimilation (, , , , 2017) || Effects of Droughts on Vegetation Condition and Ecosystem Service Delivery in Data-Poor Areas: A Case of Bobirwa Sub-District; Limpopo Basin and Botswana (, , , ) ||  (, 2014. 2016. 31 December 2020) || Vegetation dynamics in African drylands: An assessment based on the Vegetation Degradation Index in an agro-pastoral region of Botswana (, , 2019) || Operation of the Global Land Component: Algorithm Theoretical Basis.

"Detecting and Analyzing Land Use and Land Cover Changes in the Region of Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar, Libya Using Time-Series Landsat Data from 1985 to 2017",Jamal Alawamy; Siva Balasundram; Ahmad Husni; Mohd Hanif; Christopher Boon,"The region of Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar in northeastern Libya has undergone rapid, wide-ranging changes in the land use and land cover (LULC) intensified by the conversion of natural resources for food purpose, urbanization, and other socioeconomic benefits. This study examined the use of geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing techniques to gain a quantitative understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of LULC. In addition, the major factors behind LULC changes and decline of natural vegetation in the region were analyzed. A post-classification comparison approach was used to detect LULC changes in the study area between 1985 and 2017 using four Landsat images from 1985, 2000, 2010, and 2017. The observed changes were indicative of a decrease in the expanse of the natural Mediterranean forest which lost 9018 ha over 32 years, 39% of its total area, with the highest deforestation rate registered between 2010 and 2017 estimated at 513 ha. year -1 . Orchards and rain-fed agriculture lands gained 4095 ha, which matches 55% of initial area, whereas the land under irrigated crops increased by 2266 ha, about 85% of the original area. The area of urban and built-up land in 2017 was more than double in 1985 and achieved the highest urbanization rate between 2010 and 2017 at 203 ha.year -1 . Results indicate an unstable trend of bare and low vegetation lands which generally increased by about 50%. From the outcomes of this research, it is strongly recommended that urgent measures be taken to conserve the natural forest and to achieve a rational use of agricultural land in the region of Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar.","Introduction: Many countries in the world are faced with rapid, wide-ranging changes in land use (e.g., human activities and various utilization of the land) and land cover (e.g., physical characteristics of the land surface) 
Globally, land use change through the conversion of the world's forest land to other uses continues on an increasing scale due to the unprecedented growth of the human population which increases the demand for food and land 
In Libya, LULC changes have been intensified by the conversion of natural resources for food purpose and other socioeconomic benefits which have increased land exploitation and conversion by humans both on spatial and temporal scales 
Land cover classification is one of the most important remote sensing applications in the interests of identifying features such as land use by employing commonly multispectral satellite imagery 
In Libya, LULC change continues without a national monitoring program  | Materials and Methods:  | Study Area: Libya lies along the southern side of the Mediterranean coast, approximately between the latitudes of 19 ‚Ä¢ 30 N and 33 ‚Ä¢ 10 N and the longitudes of 09 ‚Ä¢ 30 E and 25 ‚Ä¢ 00 E. Libya is mostly a desert country with a dry climate and a rare vegetation cover. However, the region of Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar in the northeastern part is an exception with a relatively high annual rainfall (250-650 mm) combining intense farming areas, natural forests, and shrubs. This region is the most favored part of the country from the climatic aspect with human settlements and land use dating back to the classical period and where agricultural activities are concentrated and expanding until today. As shown in Figure  | Data Collection: Satellite imagery and ancillary data were used for investigating the historical changes of LULC in the study area over 32 years from 1985 to 2017. Four Landsat satellite scenes for Path/Row 183/37 from three types of sensors were downloaded from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/). Table 
The dates of imagery were defined based on events that had considerable impacts in expanding deforestation activities and LULC changes in Libya. The image of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) This work was carried out in an area covering the middle northern part the of Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar region between the latitudes of 32 ‚Ä¢ 42'N and 32 ‚Ä¢ 56'N and the longitudes of 21 ‚Ä¢ 30 and 21 ‚Ä¢ 50 E (Figure  | Data Collection: Satellite imagery and ancillary data were used for investigating the historical changes of LULC in the study area over 32 years from 1985 to 2017.

The dates of imagery were defined based on events that had considerable impacts in expanding deforestation activities and LULC changes in Libya. The image of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) captured in 1985 was used to represent the status before the first abolishment of the Ministry of Agriculture in 1986. Unfortunately, we could not get a usable image from the same year. The Landsat 7 Enhanced Thermal Mapper Plus (ETM+) image of 2000 was captured in May, about two months after the second abolishment of the Ministry of Agriculture, and thus was selected to picture the LULC status at the beginning of the second period. The popular uprising in Libya which started on 17 February 2011, was an important event, after which the whole country experienced dramatic changes in many political, economic, and social aspects that significantly contributed to LULC change; therefore, the Landsat 7 ETM+ image acquired on 5 September 2010, just five months before this event, was used as a reference for the beginning of the third period.
Ancillary data comprised a collection of Ground Control Points (GCP) and a combination of digital and paper maps covering the study area including a series of topographic maps at scale (1:50,000) and land use and land cover maps of 2005. In addition, aerial photographs covering a part of the study area taken on 30 May 1979, with a scale of 1:6000, were obtained and used for identification of areas subjected to LULC change. Ground truthing points were collected using a hand-held Geographical Positioning System (GPS) through field visits organized in 2016 during the same season in which satellite images were acquired. Points were separated into two groups, one for training samples used in the classification stage and another for test samples for classification accuracy assessment. | Image Processing and Analysis: Image data were treated using ENVI 5.3 and Arc-GIS 10.3 software packages. The data processing steps are given in Figure

The data processing steps are given in Figure  | Satellite Image Preprocessing: Comparative analysis using different Landsat data (i.e., TM, ETM+, and OLI (Operational Land Imager)) can be challenging due to the instrumental errors related to ache sensor, noise from several sources, and uncertainty in scale and geometric conditions 
To reduce radiometric errors, images were calibrated using the radiometric correction tool in ENVI 5.3, where raw data from the sensors (DNs) were converted to top-of-atmosphere reflectance. For atmospheric correction, a dark object subtraction model was applied in the current study as it is relatively the simplest and most widely used empirical method for classification and change detection applications 
The imageries were projected to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system, Datum LGD2006, zone 34 North and corrected for geometric errors from the sources. Image-to-map rectification method was applied to geometrically correct the Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS (Operational Land Imager and Thermal Infrared Sensor) satellite image dated 11 May 2017 using well-distributed ground control points (GCPs) taken from topographic maps at a scale of 1:50000. The other three Landsat images (1985 TM, 2000 TM, and 2010 ETM+) were then referenced by performing the image-to-image registration method using the corrected Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS 2017 image as a reference image. The first-degree polynomial method and nearest neighbor resampling technique were applied when performing the geometrical rectification and image registration.
Because of scan line corrector (SLC) failure (known as the SLC-Off problem) that occurred on May 31, 2003, for the Enhanced Thermal Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor of Landsat 7, all Landsat 7 images collected from that date till 2013 have had line gaps appear as long lines on both sides of each image, resulting in a loss about 22% of data. However, it was found that the effect of those missing data was slight or passable in some applications, such as monitoring land use change and crop quality 
Landsat 8 OLI and Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery were sharpened to increase the resolution from 30 m to 15 m, where the spatial information in the high-resolution panchromatic bands and the color information in the multispectral bands were merged using the nearest neighbor diffusion (NNDiffuse) pan sharpening technique in order to create a more valuable color image with high resolution that improves mapping and classification accuracy  | Image Classification: Image classification is an important remote sensing technique used to catalog all pixels in an image or raw remotely sensed data into a finite number of individual LULC classes to produce beneficial thematic maps and information 
For this study, a classification scheme was developed after Anderson et al.  | Image Classification: Image classification is an important remote sensing technique used to catalog all pixels in an image or raw remotely sensed data into a finite number of individual LULC classes to produce beneficial thematic maps and information 
For this study, a classification scheme was developed after Anderson et al. 
There are several different methods of imagery data classification; however, unsupervised and supervised techniques are the two main approaches commonly used for mapping land cover 
Classification accuracy was assessed using measures derived from the error matrices, and these included overall accuracy and kappa coefficient. In addition, user's and producer's accuracies were also obtained for each class, which respectively measure the commission and omission errors. The value of overall accuracy greater than 70% is regarded as an acceptable classification accuracy  | Change Detection: Change detection is defined as ""the process of identifying differences in the state of an object or phenomenon by observing it at different times"" 
The post-classification approach involves the classification of multiple date images separately to generate thematic maps, after which a pixel-based comparison of the corresponding classes is used to produce tables and maps of changes that have occurred 
The magnitude of change (MC), the percentage of change (PC), and the annual rate of change (ARC) for each LULC class during each period of time were computed based on the following equations:
ARC ha. year
where A i is the class area (ha) at the initial time, A f is the class area (ha) at the final time, and n is the number of years of the time period. | Results and Discussion:  | Accuracy Assessment: The use of maximum likelihood classifier to categorize the Landsat images (TM, ETM+, and OLI/TIRS) has produced maps showing the distribution of the five prevalent LULC classes in the study area for the years 1985, 2000, 2011, and 2017. Accuracy assessment was carried out for the classified maps of 2010 and 2017 to examine the agreement between the produced maps and what actually exists on the ground. Table 
The LULC classification of Landsat ETM+ 2010 and OLI 2017 recorded the largest commission and omission error within the BLV, IC, and OR classes (Figure  | Year: Overall Accuracy (%) The classified maps of 2010 and 2017 achieved overall accuracy values of 81% and 83%, respectively, indicating that both LULC maps met the criterion. Furthermore, values of the kappa coefficient for both the two maps were more than 0.75, indicating good agreements. Results also showed that means of commission and omission errors were less than 20%, inferring an acceptable classification accuracy.
The LULC classification of Landsat ETM+ 2010 and OLI 2017 recorded the largest commission and omission error within the BLV, IC, and OR classes (Figure  | Supervised Classification: The processing and supervised classification of Landsat imagery (TM, ETM+, and OLI/TIRS) acquired in 1985, 2000, 2010, and 2017 produced four classification maps for the five LULC types prevalent in the study area (Figure  | Supervised Classification: The processing and supervised classification of Landsat imagery (TM, ETM+, and OLI/TIRS) acquired in 1985, 2000, 2010, and 2017 produced four classification maps for the five LULC types prevalent in the study area (Figure  | Supervised Classification: The processing and supervised classification of Landsat imagery (TM, ETM+, and OLI/TIRS) acquired in 1985, 2000, 2010, and 2017 produced four classification maps for the five LULC types prevalent in the study area (Figure  | LULC Change Detection: The outcomes of the post-classification comparison give an account of the amount and type of change that has taken place for each LULC class. Areal change of LULC types in all imageries was obviously visible and occurred as either an expansion or a decline between sequential dates. Attempts to further study these outcomes can give insight to the land use behavior, pattern, and rate at which the changes occur in the study area in particular and in the region of Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar in general. This essential information would be vital for development planners and decision makers.
Change matrices and statistics for the periods of 1985-2000, 2000-2010, and 2010-2017 were generated from the comparison of classified maps of 1985, 2000, 2010, and 2017 and will be discussed in detail in the following sections. | LULC Change between 1985 and 2000: In 1985, the NMF class constituted the major type of LULC in the study area at 64.17% of the total area, followed by OR (20.62%), IR (7.44%), and UB (4.79%), whereas BLV only covered 3% and occupied the smallest area. During the 15-year time frame from 1985 to 2000, the area covered by NMF declined by 2724 ha, viz. 11.79% of the initial area, while other LULC types increased at different rates. Table 
It is important to remember that, in 1986, under the previous political regime, the Ministry of Agriculture in Libya was abolished with all its departments and various control and enforcement agencies at the national level including the forest guard; thus, the agricultural sectors in all regions regrouped under the management of the sector directors, and this encouraged forests encroachment and failure of protection efforts. The weakness of institutions and absence of accountability among other factors encouraged the local people to engage in forest encroachment by either clearance of vegetation cover for agricultural expansion or by cutting trees for gathering firewood, especially for making the popular Libyan bread, in addition to producing charcoal for heating, barbecue, and cooking. In addition, some landowners have tried exploiting forest land in an attempt to regain their lands that were confiscated and turned into state property by law (No. 142 of 1970). Although the Ministry of Agriculture was reinstated in 1990 and a new forest law was enacted in 1992 to correct the accesses committed, the disaster of forest loss had already taken place and its negative effects were visible and tangible.
On the other hand, forests in Libya, like others in the Mediterranean region, which is one of the most affected regions by forest fires, have suffered excessive degradation by fires which are mainly due to manmade activities 
The area of agricultural land in 2000, in comparison to 1985, increased by 2050 ha, where the area of OR increased from 7426 ha (20.62%) to 8659 ha (24.05%) with an annual rate of 82 ha.year -1 , while the area of IC increased from 2679 ha (7.44%) to 3496 (9.71%) with an annual rate of 55 ha.year -1 (Table 
Libya has given the agricultural sector the largest share of the allocation of its transformation agenda through developmental projects during the 1970s and 1980s such as vertical and horizontal expansion in crop and fodder production. The region of Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar received a large share of these allocations that were used to reclaim large tracts of land estimated at about 160,000 ha. New farms were established in the Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar region to produce fruit and grain crops to attain self-sufficiency in food production; however, substantial areas of natural cover have been left without change for conservation purposes or to be used for natural grazing, particularly on hilly sites. The local people later exploited these marginal unused areas for establishing more private fields to produce cereal crops as well as fruits and irrigated vegetables in order to capitalize on the increasingly lucrative market.

The results shown in Table  | LULC Change between 2000 and 2010: During the 10 years between 2000 and 2010, more forest land was cleared or changed to other land uses. NMF areas, which amounted to 20,385ha (56.61%) in 2000, decreased to 17,685 ha (49.11%) in 2010, with an annual rate of 270 ha.year -1 (1.32%) (Table  | LULC Change between 2000 and 2010: During the 10 years between 2000 and 2010, more forest land was cleared or changed to other land uses. NMF areas, which amounted to 20,385ha (56.61%) in 2000, decreased to 17,685 ha (49.11%) in 2010, with an annual rate of 270 ha.year -1 (1.32%) (Table 
During the second period, each of the OR and IC classes increased by 1214 ha, with an annual rate of 121 ha.year -1 (Table 
Population growth and the consequent increase in food demand encouraged farmers in the study area to extend their cultivated areas through the clearance of more forests in order to benefit from the increased profits by marketing the agricultural produce in neighboring towns and cities as well as in the remote areas in the west of the country. Drilling more underground wells by the local population in the study area, either at their own expense or through state support in form of agricultural and pastoral loans, has greatly augmented the rate of deforestation and land conversion for irrigated agriculture.
Classification results shown in Table 
The increase in urban expansion might be attributed to population growth within the region of Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar through the period 1995-2006 (Figure 
The area of BLV in the period between 2000 and 2010, unlike in the previous period  | LULC Change between 2010 and 2017: The results shown in Table 
It should be recalled that the deforestation during the third period was induced by some factors entirely unlike those during the previous periods from 1985 to 2010. Presently, increased deforestation might be attributed to a of factors including the total breakdown of the Al-Qaddafi regime in 2011 and the accompanying chaos and spread of weapons, the inability of subsequent governments to prevent forest clearance, the lack of housing projects, and the significant increase in land price. Some citizens exploited the fall of the government regime, the cessation of regulatory agencies, and the complete absence of agricultural policing to clear more forest land for agricultural expansion or to sell cleared land building houses or construction of holiday homes and resorts.
The supervised classification analysis indicated an increase in the area of agricultural land in the study area during the third period (2010-2017), which was estimated at 1883 ha, where the area of agricultural land use increased from 14,583 ha (40.50% of total area) in 2010 to 15,466 ha (44.72% of total area) in 2017 (Table 
The results shown in Table 
During the third period, UB extended from 6.75% to 10.70% of the total land use and had an annual rate of increase of 8.36%, which was much higher compared to the previous periods. The UB area increased from 2430 ha in 2010 to 3852 ha in 2017, achieving a total increase of 1422 ha and representing about 58.52% of the initial area. The annual rate of increase during this period which was estimated at 203 ha.year -1 (Table 
Results in Table 
Several factors were responsible for the increase in the urban expansion in the Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar region. The most important factors are administrative causes that are related to the state policy, the weak application of legislation, and urban laws relating to the protection of agricultural and forest lands. Furthermore, population concentration in cities is not in tandem with their needs for residential schemes due to poor planning and organization which have contributed to the emergence of social and financial motivation for unplanned urban sprawl represented in the dominance of some tribes on large areas of land who capitalized on the housing deficit and the lack of new housing projects to sell land as residential plots without approval from the state. On the other hand, after the fall of the previous political regime in 2011, some people misappropriated state funds and bought lands in or around cities and then constructed residential or holiday houses as a means of money laundering. Additionally, some people from outside the district, particularly displaced citizens and migrants from some Arabic countries who left their homelands fleeing the menace of ongoing wars and armed conflicts, have shown interest in acquiring land and building houses to live in the study area. These people perceive the study area as comparatively safer than other regions in Libya, so land ownership is regarded as a means of attaining stability.
Additionally, because the region of Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar includes the finest places for tourism and recreation in Libya, the demand for accommodations for tourists and visitors has increased, which encouraged some citizens to establish more holiday homes and resorts in the absence of government control and stringent regulations.
The results in Table 
On the other hand, forest fires were a serious occurrence that led to the increase in the area of BLV land and to the decline of natural vegetation. Government reports indicated a significant increase in forest fires in Libya after 2011. In May 2013, after a dry season with severe shortage of rainfall and severe heat wave, a total of 5924 ha was destroyed in Libya due to more than seven fires of at least 40 ha, most of which occurred in the Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar region, which includes a single very large fire of more than 3300 ha 
The increased demand for firewood during the years following the Libyan uprising as a result of the wars which broke out in some Libyan cities was another factor that contributed to the decline in forest cover and to the increase in BLV. A severe shortage of cooking gas and kerosene in addition to electricity outage were common during the period after 2011. This has forced citizens to seek alternatives for heating and cooking; regrettably, they found cutting forest trees to be the easier option for gathering firewood and for producing charcoal for use or selling in local markets. Cutting forest trees is a negative phenomenon that can lead to stripping plenty of spaces of their natural vegetation cover. In fact, in such a semiarid climate, the loss of natural trees is difficult to recover due to the inability of the existing tree species in the region to regenerate naturally in addition to other limiting factors such as insufficient moisture due to frequent droughts and soil shallowness resulting from increased erosion rate after removal of protective vegetation. | Conclusion: Remote sensing is an effective tool for mapping natural resources at a regional level. The outcomes of the investigation enumerated in this research highlight the importance of satellite digital image processing with the aid of GIS technology in mapping and detecting LULC changes. Maximum likelihood supervised classification of Landsat TM5, ETM+7, and OLI8 imagery and post-classification comparison approach can be used to predict and obtain fairly accurate maps of LULC changes. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient values of the LULC classifications achieved in this research is encouraging. It was generally observed that there was a significant decline in natural Mediterranean forest (NMF) and a corresponding increase in other land uses such as orchards and rain-fed agriculture (OR), irrigated crops (IC), urban and built-up lands (UB), and bare and low vegetation (BLV). The changes observed were indicative of a decrease in the expanse of NMF land, which lost about 39% of its total area over the 32 years, and the highest deforestation rate was registered in the third period (2010-2017). The high deforestation was generally a result of citizen exploitation of the weakness of the state's institutions post 2011 revolution in addition to the frequency of forest fires. Most of the changed area of NMF were converted for agricultural land use. Land under the OR class increased by about 55% and achieved a greater rate of increase during the third period, whereas the land under the IC class increased by about 85% with a higher rate of increase achieved between 2000 and 2010, and the lowest rate was recorded during the third period from 2010 to 2017. The urban expansion in the study area was mostly at the expense of forest and agricultural lands. The annual rate of urbanization during the third period was approximately 10 and 5 times more than those recorded in the first period 
Indeed, if the present trend of deforestation continues, the forest in the study area will lose more than 50% of its current natural forest cover over the next 15 years. Deforestation in the study area and Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar in general is an important environmental challenge.","Monitoring land-cover changes: A comparison of change detection techniques (, 1999) || A study of change in agricultural and forest land in Gwalior city using satellite imagery (, , , , 2017) || Monitoring and predicting land use change in Tripoli Metropolitan City using an integrated Markov chain and cellular automata models in GIS (, , 2014) || Time series land cover mapping and change detection analysis using geographic information system and remote sensing (, , , , , , , , 2018) || Changing consumption patterns-Drivers and the environmental impact (, , , 2018) || Land use change around protected areas: Management to balance human needs and ecological function (, , , , , 2007) || Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015: How are the World's Forests Changing?

We developed a new automated approach for globally consistent, high resolution, near real-time (NRT) land use land cover (LULC) classification leveraging deep learning on 10 m Sentinel-2 imagery. We utilize a highly scalable cloud-based system to apply this approach and provide an open, continuous feed of LULC predictions in parallel with Sentinel-2 acquisitions. This first-of-its-kind NRT product, which we collectively refer to as Dynamic World, accommodates a variety of user needs ranging from extremely up-to-date LULC data to custom global composites representing user-specified date ranges. Furthermore, the continuous nature of the product's outputs enables refinement, extension, and even redefinition of the LULC classification. In combination, these unique attributes enable unprecedented flexibility for a diverse community of users across a variety of disciplines.","Background & Summary: Regularly updated global land use land cover (LULC) datasets provide the basis for understanding the status, trends, and pressures of human activity on carbon cycles, biodiversity, and other natural and anthropogenic processes 
Currently, almost all moderate resolution LULC products are available with only limited spatial and/or temporal coverage (e.g., USGS NLCD 
Simultaneous advances in large-scale cloud computing and machine learning algorithms in high-performance open source software frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow  | Methods: Land Use Land Cover taxonomy. The classification schema or ""taxonomy"" for Dynamic World, shown in Table 
Training dataset collection. Our modeling approach relies on semi-supervised deep learning and requires spatially dense (i.e., ideally wall-to-wall) annotations. To collect a diverse set of training and evaluation data, we divided the world into three regions: the Western Hemisphere (160¬∞W to 20¬∞W), Eastern Hemisphere-1 (20¬∞W to 100¬∞E), and Eastern Hemisphere-2 (100¬∞E to 160¬∞W). We further divided each region by the 14 RESOLVE Ecoregions biomes 
At each sample location, we performed an initial selection of Sentinel-2 images from 2019 scenes based on image cloudiness metadata reported in the Sentinel-2 tile's QA60 band. We further filtered scenes to remove images with many masked pixels. We finally extracted individual tiles of 510 √ó 510 pixels centered on the sample sites from random dates in 2019. Tiles were sampled in the UTM projection of the source image and we selected one tile corresponding to a single Sentinel-2 ID number and single date.
Further steps were then taken to obtain an ""as balanced as possible"" training dataset with respect to the LULC classifications from the respective LULC products. In particular, for each Dynamic World LULC category contained within a tile, the tile was labeled to be high, medium, or low in that category. We then selected an approximately equal number of tiles with high, medium or low category labels for each category.
To achieve a large dataset of labeled Sentinel-2 scenes, we worked with two groups of annotators. The first group included 25 annotators with previous photo-interpretation and/or remote sensing experience. The expert group labeled approximately 4,000 image tiles (Fig. 
All Dynamic World annotators used the Labelbox platform  | Image preprocessing.: We prepared Sentinel-2 imagery in a number of ways to accommodate both annotation and training workflows. An overview of the preprocessing workflow is shown in Fig. 
For training data collection, we used the Sentinel-2 Level-2A (L2A) product, which provides radiometrically calibrated surface reflectance (SR) processed using the Sen2Cor software package 
In addition to our preliminary cloud filtering in training image selection, we adopted and applied a novel masking solution that combines several existing products and techniques. Our procedure is to first take the 10 m Sentinel-2 Cloud Probability (S2C) product available in Earth Engine 
In order to remove cloud shadows, we extend the cloudy pixel mask 5 km in the direction opposite the solar azimuthal angle using the scene level metadata ""SOLAR_AZIMUTH_ANGLE"" and a directional distance transform (DDT) operation in Earth Engine. The final cloud and shadow mask is resampled to 100 m to decrease both the data volume and processing time. The resulting mask is applied to Sentinel-2 images used for training and inference such that unmasked pixels represent observations that are likely to be cloud-and shadow-free.
The distribution of Sentinel-2 reflectance values are highly compressed towards the low end of the sensor range, with the remainder mostly occupied by high return phenomena like snow and ice, bare ground, and specular reflection. To combat this imbalance, we introduce a normalization scheme that better utilizes the useful range of Sentinel-2 reflectance values for each band. We first log-transform the raw reflectance values to  equalize the long tail of highly reflective surfaces, then remap percentiles of the log-transformed values to points on a sigmoid function. The latter is done to bound on (0, 1) without truncation, and condenses the extreme end members of reflectances to a smaller range.
To account for an annotation skill differential between the non-expert and expert groups, we one-hot encode the labeled pixels, and smooth them according to the confidence in a binary label of the individual annotator (expert/non-expert): this is effectively linearly interpolating the distributions per-pixel from their one-hot encoding (i.e. a vector of binary variables for each class label) to uniform probability. We used 0.2 for experts, and 0.3 for non-experts (i.e. ~82% confidence on the true class for experts and ~73% confidence on the true class for the non-expert. We note that these values approximately mirror the Non-Expert to Expert Consensus agreement as discussed in the Technical Validation section). This is akin to standard label-smoothing 
We generate a pair of weights for each pixel in an augmented example designed to compensate for class imbalance across the training set and weight high-frequency spatial features at the inputs during ""synthesis"" (discussed further in the following section). We also include a weight per pixel designed to attenuate labels in the center of labeled polygons where human annotators often missed small details using a simple edge finding kernel.
We finally perform a series of augmentations (random rotation and random per-band contrasting) to our input data to improve generalizability and performance of our model. These augmentations are applied four times to each example to yield our final training dataset of examples paired with class distributions, masks, and weights (Fig.  | Model training.: Our broad approach to transferring the supervised label data to a system that could be applied globally was to train a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) 
Although applying CNN modeling, including FCNN, to recover LULC is not a new idea  | Data Records: The Dynamic World NRT product is available for the full Sentinel-2 L1C collection from 2015-06-27 to present. The revisit frequency of Sentinel-2 is between 2-5 days depending on latitude, though Dynamic World imagery is produced at about half this frequency (across all latitudes) given the aforementioned 35% filter on the CLOUDY_PIXEL_PERCENTAGE Sentinel-2 L1C metadata.
The NRT product is hosted as an Earth Engine Image Collection under the collection ID ""GOOGLE/ DYNAMICWORLD/V1"". This is referenced in either the Earth Engine Python or JavaScript client library with ee.ImageCollection('GOOGLE/DYNAMICWORLD/V1') and in the Earth Engine data catalog at https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/GOOGLE_DYNAMICWORLD_V1  | technical Validation: We used several different approaches to characterize the quality of our NRT products. We first compared expert and non-expert annotations to establish baseline agreement across human interpreters. This is particularly relevant in understanding the quality of 20,000 training tiles that were annotated by non-experts. We then compared expert reference annotations with Dynamic World products and to existing national and global products produced at an annual time step. We note that, for all comparisons with Dynamic World products, we ran the trained Dynamic World model directly on the Sentinel-2 imagery in the test tile and applied our cloud mask in order to benchmark the NRT results for the reference image date.
To create a balanced validation set, we randomly extracted ten image-markup pairs per biome per hemisphere from the existing markups: 140 from the 14 biomes in the Western Hemisphere, 130 from the 13 biomes in Eastern Hemisphere-1, and another 140 from the 14 biomes in Eastern Hemisphere-2. Each tile was independently labeled by three annotators from the expert group and by a member of the non-expert group such that we had four different sets of annotations for each validation tile. In total, this process produced 1636 tile annotations over 409 Sentinel-2 tiles (Fig. 
Annotations were combined in three different ways to measure (1) agreement between expert and non-expert labels, (2) expert-to-expert consistency, and (3) agreement between machine labeling and multi-expert consensus under several expert voting schemes.The four voting schemes considered were Three Expert Strict agreement, where all three experts had an opinion and all three agreed on feature class; Expert Consensus, where all three experts agreed, or where two experts agreed and the third had no opinion, or where one expert had an opinion and the other two did not; Expert Majority, where at least two experts agreed on feature class, or where one expert had an opinion and the other two did not; Expert Simple Majority, where at least two experts agreed and at least two agreed on feature class. | Comparison of expert and non-expert annotations.: To assess the quality of non-expert annotations, which comprise the majority of our training dataset, we directly compared rasterized versions of hand-digitized expert and non-expert annotations for our validation sample. Though these validation images were not used as part of model training, this comparison highlights strengths and potential weaknesses of the training set. We summarize the agreement between non-experts and experts for different voting schemes in Table 
Agreement for all comparisons was greater than 75%, suggesting fairly consistent labeling across different levels of expertise. As would be expected, the Three Expert Strict set shows the highest overlap with the Non-Expert set (91.5%), as only the pixel labels with the highest confidence amongst expert annotators remain.   the highest probability (or ""Top-1"" label) was compared to the four expert voting schemes. Neither the validation images, nor other images from the same locations were available to the model during training. Thus, this assessment quantifies how well the model performs when applied outside the training domain. The results of these comparisons are shown in Tables  | Comparison of Dynamic World predictions with expert annotations.: We considered the Expert Consensus scheme to best balance ""easy"" labels (where many experts would agree) and ""hard"" labels (where labels would be arguably more ambiguous) and used this as our primary performance metric. Overall agreement between these single-image Dynamic World model outputs and the expert labels was observed to be 73.8%. Comparing this 73.8% to the non-expert to expert agreement of 77.8% in Table  | Comparison of Dynamic World and other LULC datasets.: As a third point of comparison, we contextualize our results in terms of existing products. We qualitatively and quantitatively compared Dynamic World with other publicly available global and regional LULC datasets (Table 
Measured against the expert consensus of annotations for the 409 global tiles, Dynamic World exceeded the agreement of all other LULC datasets except for the regional product LCMAP 2017 (Table  | Usage Notes: Extensions of the Dynamic World NRT collection offer new opportunities to create global analysis products at a speed, cost, and performance that is appropriate for a broad range of stakeholders, e.g. national or regional governments, civil society, and national and international research and policy organizations. It is our hope that Dynamic World and spatially consistent products like it can begin to make LULC and derived analysis globally equitable. | Time series of class probabilities.: Though we used Top-1 labels for validation and cross-dataset comparisons, Dynamic World includes class probabilities in addition to a single ""best"" label for each pixel (Table 
Uncertainties. We find single-date Dynamic World classifications agree with the annotators nearly as well as the annotators agree amongst each other. The Dynamic World NRT product also achieves performance near, or exceeding many popular regional and global annual LULC products when compared to annotations for the same validation tiles. However, we have observed that performance varies spatially and temporally as a function of both the quality of S2 cloud masking and variability in land cover and condition.
Dynamic World tends to perform most strongly in temperate and tree-dominated biomes. Arid shrublands and rangelands were observed to present the greatest source of confusion specifically between crops and shrub. In Fig. 
We also note that single-date classifications are highly dependent on accurate cloud and cloud shadow masking. Though we have implemented a fairly conservative masking process that includes several existing products and algorithms, missed clouds are typically misclassified as Snow & Ice and missed shadows as Water. However, because Dynamic World predictions are directly linked to individual Sentinel-2 acquisitions, these misclassifications can be identified by inspecting source imagery and resolved through additional filtering or other post-processing.
Creating new products from the Dynamic World collection. As a fundamentally NRT and continuous product, Dynamic World allows users to constrain observed data ranges and leverage the continuous nature of the outputs to characterize land conditions as needed for their specific interests and tasks. For example, we do not expect the prescriptiveness of the ""label"" band to be appropriate for all user needs. By applying a desired threshold or more advanced decision framework to the estimated probabilities, it is possible to customize a discrete classification as is appropriate for a user's unique definitions or downstream task. Furthermore, users can aggregate NRT results to represent longer time periods. For example, one could create a monthly product as seen in Fig. 
Quantifying accuracy of derived products. Rigorous assessment of map accuracy and good practices in estimating areas of mapped classes require probability sampling design that supports design-based inference of population-level parameters such as overall accuracy 
In the assessments performed as part of our Technical Validation, we focus on agreement between reference annotations and our Top-1 NRT labels as our primary validation metric. While these agreement assessments support the general quality and utility of the Dynamic World dataset from the perspective of benchmarking, we note that our confusion matrices are not population confusion matrices and thus cannot be used to estimate population parameters. These matrices also do not account for model-based estimates of uncertainty, specifically class probability bands that characterize uncertainty in model predictions. While more rigorous characterization of model uncertainty could be achieved using model-based inference techniques 
As an example, a Dynamic World derived product was generated by simply averaging class probabilities and a proof-of-concept assessment was performed by the University of Maryland Global Land Analysis and Discovery Laboratory (UMD-GLAD) using a stratified random sampling strategy with a total of 19 strata based on a prototype 30 m UMD-GLAD LULC map. Fifty sampling units were randomly selected from each of the 19 strata. Reference data for interpretation and class assignment consisted of high resolution data from the Google Maps Satellite layer viewed in Google Earth and MODIS time-series NDVI. Each interpreted sampling unit was re-labeled with one of the eight DynamicWorld classes and all results were compared to the temporally aggregated DynamicWorld product. Results generally indicated higher accuracies in terms of precision/user's accuracy and recall/producer's accuracy for relatively stable LULC classes such as water and trees. However, mixed classes such as built area and shrub & scrub and classes such as bare ground, crop, grass, and flooded vegetation that represent transient states or exhibit greater temporal dynamics tended to show much lower accuracies. Some of these lower levels of agreement also reflect potential mismatches in class definitions that arise from the NRT nature of the Dynamic World classes, i.e. ""Flooded vegetation"" may characterize an ephemeral state that is different from a more traditional ""wetland"" categorization.
While this example provides one possible derived product and assessment useful for demonstration purposes, we intentionally do not provide a standard derivative map product of the Dynamic World dataset and instead encourage users, as is standard practice, to develop assessments of their unique derivative map products using tools such as Collect Earth 40 designed for reference data collection and community standard guidance ","The Importance of Land-Cover Change in Simulating Future Climates (, 2005) || The impact of global land-cover change on the terrestrial water cycle (, , , 2012) || Land management and land-cover change have impacts of similar magnitude on surface temperature (, 2014) || MCD12Q1 MODIS/Terra+Aqua Land Cover Type Yearly L3 Global 500m SIN Grid V006 (, , 2019) || Hierarchical mapping of annual global land cover 2001 to present: The MODIS Collection 6 Land Cover product (, , , , 2019) || Climate Change Initiative, Land Cover maps (, 2017) || Copernicus Global Land Service: Land Cover 100m: collection 3: epoch 2019: Globe (, 2020) || Copernicus Global Land Cover Layers-Collection 2.

Land-use change is associated with multi-century loss of elephant ecosystems in Asia,Shermin De Silva; Tiffany Wu; Philip Nyhus; Ashley Weaver; Alison Thieme; Josiah Johnson; Jamie Wadey; Alexander Mossbrucker; Thinh Vu; Thy Neang; Becky Chen; Melissa Songer; Peter Leimgruber,"Understanding historic patterns of land use and land cover change across large temporal and spatial scales is critical for developing effective biodiversity conservation management and policy. We quantify the extent and fragmentation of suitable habitat across the continental range of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) based on present-day occurrence data and land-use variables between 850 and 2015 A.D. We found that following centuries of relative stability, over 64% (3.36 million km 2 ) of suitable elephant habitat across Asia was lost since the year 1700, coincident with colonial-era land-use practices in South Asia and subsequent agricultural intensification in Southeast Asia. Average patch size dropped 83% from approximately 99,000-16,000 km 2 and the area occupied by the largest patch decreased 83% from ~ 4 million km 2 (45% of area) to 54,000 km 2 (~ 7.5% of area). Whereas 100% of the area within 100 km of the current elephant range could have been considered suitable habitat in the year 1700, over half was unsuitable by 2015, driving potential conflict with people. These losses reflect long-term decline of non-forested ecosystems, exceeding estimates of deforestation within this century. Societies must consider ecological histories in addition to proximate threats to develop more just and sustainable land-use and conservation strategies.
Habitat loss and degradation are leading drivers of terrestrial biodiversity loss worldwide 1-3 . An estimated three quarters of the Earth's land surface has been significantly altered by human activities 4 . Historic reasons include conversion for cultivation and settlement, reflecting both local and global socioeconomic drivers of land-use and land-cover (LULC) change 
Although LULC trends in recent decades may be inferred from satellite imagery and statistical data 2,7,8 , it remains difficult to assess the impact of long-term anthropogenic processes on particular species or ecosystems. Human-induced changes are known to restrict the ranges of many terrestrial mammal species 9,10 but historical records on population abundance and distribution are often limited for many taxa, complicating efforts to assess impacts over longer periods. Nevertheless, longer historical perspectives are necessary to appreciate the true magnitude of changes to threatened ecosystems. For example, historical studies have influenced conservation policies related to remnant prairies in Oregon, wetlands in Iowa, and forests in Germany, at times challenging standard management practices 11 .
One way to overcome these data gaps is through ecological niche models (see also species distribution models), in which species occurrence data, together with environmental covariates, are used to infer possible occurrence or suitable habitat at a different area or time ","Untitled Section: 1165 years for a widely-distributed endangered mammal, the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). Elephants are ecosystem engineers that uniquely influence the structure of ecosystems 
The extant Asian elephant range (Fig. 
We characterized change in the extent and fragmentation of elephant ecosystems for the period between 850 and 2015 A.D using land-use variables from the Land-Use Harmonization 2 dataset  | Results: Historic changes. Percentage of primary forest cover was less important for the LUH2 model than elevation, forested and non-forested primary and secondary lands, croplands, pastures and wood harvest activities (Table 
Present-day suitability versus distribution. Only 48.6% of the current range was found to be suitable by 2015 (Figs. 2, 3, S3 and Table  | Discussion: We find that after several centuries of relative stability, nearly two-thirds of habitat suitable for elephants within the 13 elephant range countries declined within the past 300-500 years. A gradual negative trend in the extent of suitable habitat commences as early as the 1500 s, but shows marked acceleration during the 1700s. Whereas all of the area (100%) within 100 km of the current range was classified as suitable in 1700, less than half (48.6%) of it was classified as suitable by the year 2015. Change in the Largest Patch Index (LPI) signifies that in the year 1700 an elephant might hypothetically have been able to traverse as much as 45% of the ""suitable"" area without interruption, but by 2015 this was down to just 7.5%. These include two of the top three most threatened ecoregions in the world, the tropical dry forest and tropical/subtropical grasslands and savannahs 
It has been shown that up to 90% of tropical woodlands were inhabited and shaped by human societies over the past 12,000 years, opposing the view that ""human transformation of terrestrial nature is mostly recent and inherently destructive. "" 
these landscapes, the losses we report are unlikely to represent areas of pure ""wilderness"" or primary forest, but rather a mixture of habitat types, including those with some degree of human management 
The presence of elephants in suboptimal habitat today likely reflects a lag between land-use changes and elephant population responses  | Regional trends.: Trends in South Asia are largely driven by India and Sri Lanka, which contain the largest remaining wild populations (Table 
The relationship between people and nature today is complicated by the ongoing expansion of population centers, agriculture sectors, and extractive economic activity that places additional pressure on forest resources 
This longer perspective also contextualizes another recent study in Nepal that documented changes in forest cover between 1930 and 2020 using topographic maps and satellite imagery 
Table 
quantified directly using data on forest cover change over the past century but negative incidents may be most prevalent in areas of relatively recent deforestation as remnant elephant populations continue to be displaced. In Southeast Asia, the disappearance of highly suitable habitat in what is now central Thailand is particularly striking (Figs. 
Two of the most critically endangered elephant populations are found in Sumatra and Vietnam. Although nearly 98% of the current range in Vietnam is classified as suitable (Table 
LULC change is both a cause and a consequence of human and wildlife displacements. Our results indicate that areas of suitable habitat for elephants have not merely decreased, they have also redistributed (Fig.  | Range: In 2018 there was rapid, large-scale disruption of a trans-boundary elephant corridor at Cox Bazar between Bangladesh and Myanmar with the settlement of Rohingya refugees 
Given the depletion and fragmentation of suitable habitat, as well as elephants' preference for secondary and regenerating habitat, attempts at dispersal outside the current range might be expected  | Study limitations and possible extensions.: There are a number of reasons why the actual distribution of a species may not match its modelled niche, such as dispersal limitations or overharvest (i.e. hunting and capture, see also 
Other limitations concern the definition of what actually constitutes ""suitable"" habitat for the species. Ecological niche models typically rely on relating the species of interest (i.e. occurrence, behavior) to ecological covariates. They exclude at least two important considerations. First, habitat characteristics offer a limited view of which areas may support a particular species in the absence of demographic data. Animals may be attracted to locations that promote harm to them; these are known as ecological traps 
Conversely, we must also avoid mistaking the present management of a landscape with the practices that gave rise to it. We reiterate that although human activities are now limited in the locations we sampled, these areas were very likely also shaped by people preceding and during the time scales being considered here 
Finally, the datasets underlying our results (the LUH2 variables) use relatively coarse resolution and are themselves models based on assumptions concerning land-use transitions rather than direct measurements and observations. In fact, results based on the LUH2 reconstructions may be more conservative than models using finer resolution data that make fewer assumptions. Winkler et al. 
Likewise, more work is needed to understand possible changes in suitable habitat under future scenarios of land-use. One study using fine-resolution (1 km 2 ) LULC datasets for India and Nepal predicted a loss of 41.8% of the available habitat over this century  | Methods: Elephant occurrence. A schematic of the work process is given in Fig. 
To minimize sampling bias that could result in model overfitting, we further subsampled data to cover the full distribution as widely as possible while eliminating redundant points located within any particular landscape.
For instance, thousands of potential redundancies from collar-based tracking datasets were removed by using only one randomly selected data point per individual, per population or landscape. Outliers from the remaining points were removed using Cooks' distance 
Predictor variables. We used the Land-Use Harmonization 2 (LUH2) data products 
Data analysis and benchmarking. We limited the geographic extent of all analyses to the 13 range countries in which elephants are currently found. We used MAXENT, a maximum entropy algorithm 
To establish whether a model using the LUH2 variables yields reasonable predictions of habitat suitability for elephants, we first compared the result for the year 2000 to a prediction based on other, higher resolution benchmark variables, including climate, terrain, land-cover, and human and livestock densities (n = 12 variables, Table 
Polygons representing the known elephant range were digitized from Hedges et al. 
We calculated the total change in extent of suitable habitat by subtracting the area of suitable habitat available in 2015 from the area available in 1700, as major changes were observed within this period. We also specifically quantified the percentage of suitable habitat found within a 100 km buffer of the current range polygons in both years. We then calculated fragmentation statistics (Table  | States (units: fraction of grid cell): Transitions between land use states (units: fraction of grid cell per year)

Impact of land use and land cover change on the landscape pattern and service value of the village ecosystem in the karst desertification control,Qi Wang; Kangning Xiong; Jiayi Zhou; Hua Xiao; Shanhai Song; Chen Zeng; Anlu Zhang; Huiqing Han,"Human activities have had a significant impact on ecosystems. Studying landscape patterns and ecosystem services (ES) at the village scale based on land use and land cover (LULC) is essential in addressing current ecosystem issues. Based on GF images, the paper selects village ecosystems of karst desertification control (KDC) as the research object. It uses the landscape pattern index, topographic position index (TPI), and value equivalent method to conduct a spatial and temporal analysis of the ecosystem service value (ESV) of the karst desertification control cycle (2015)(2016)(2017)(2018)(2019)(2020). The results show that: 1) forest land, orchard land, and construction land increase, and dryland and grassland decrease. The landscape shows an aggregated state, with spreading and connectivity increasing while fragrant diversity is decreasing. 2) The total ecosystem service value increased by CNY 63.45 √ó 10 4 , with regulating and cultural services on the rise and supply and support services on the decline. 3) With the rise of the TPI, the value of the supply services is inversely U-shaped, while the value of the remaining services increases. This study provides a case study about karst desertification areas for village-scale ecosystem services research.","Introduction: Land use for producing goods and services is the most significant human change to the planet 
Land cover has been changing rapidly due to solid human activities such as agricultural and urban construction 
The value of ecosystem services is a quantitative indicator of ecosystem services 
A growing body of research on land use, landscape patterns, and ecosystem services aim to address scientific questions arising from specific regions and objectives (Q. J. 
Karst landscapes are a typical type of carbonate landscape worldwide, with carbonate karst covering more than 10%-15% of the continental area 
Therefore, we have selected village ecosystems as the object of study within the demonstration area where the KDC project is implemented 
2 Materials and methods | Study area: The study area is a village ecosystem consisting of Chaoying Village, Chongfeng Village, and Zhongshan Village, located in Salaxi Town, Qixingguan District, Bijie City, Guizhou Province, China (Figure  | Data sources: Land use data is obtained through remote sensing classification, manual visual interpretation, and field surveys. The original images are from the GF-2 satellite and the in-formation for the required images was retrieved from the China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application website (http://36.112.130.153:7777/DSSPlatform/index. html), with data provided by the GF Guizhou Centre. The GF-2 satellite was launched in 2014 and equipped with two PAN/MS cameras. The instrument collects one PAN band (0.45-0.9 ¬µm) of 1 m spatial resolution and four MS bands (0.45-0.52 ¬µm, 0.52-0.59 ¬µm, 0. 63-0.69 ¬µm, and 0.77-0.89 ¬µm) of 4 m spatial resolution. The swath width of 45 km, and the repetition cycle of 5 days  | Research methods:  | Selection of landscape pattern indices: The landscape pattern index is the most effective measure of information about the composition and spatial structure of the landscape  | Calculating the value of ecosystem services: In the Eqs 1, 2, Œ∏ is the revision factor of the study area, Q and Q 0 are the average yield per unit area of the study area and the country, respectively. E i denotes the modified equivalent factor of land use type i , and E i0 denotes the equivalent factor of the same land use type as determined by 
The socio-economic survey and the statistical yearbook (https:// data.cnki.net/yearbook/Single/N2021110004) showed that the grain yield per unit area of arable land in 2020 was 6.73 t/hm 2 and 5.73 t/hm 2 for the study area and the whole country, respectively. The equivalent revision factor for ecological services in the study area was derived from Eq. 1 as 1.17.
According to the literature 
In the Eq. 3, E a is the economic value per unit area of farmland ecosystem providing food production services (CNY/hm 2 ), i is the crop type; p i is the unit price of i crops (CNY/kg); q i is the yield of i food crops (kg/hm 2 ); m i is the area of i food crops (hm 2 ); M is the total area of n food crops (hm 2 ).
According to the socio-economic survey of the study area in 2020, the yield of maize and potatoes, food crops in the region, was 1,333,200 kg and 1,579,500 kg, respectively. The sown areas were 222.2 hm 2 and 210.6 hm 2 , respectively. Price obtained from the official website of the Bureau of Agriculture and Rural Development of Bijie City (https://www. bijie.gov.cn/bm/bjsnyncj/gk_5126790/scxq/index_ 1.html). Corn and potatoes cost CNY 2.763 per kg and CNY 2.613 per kg, respectively. Thus, according to Eq. 3, the economic value of food production services provided per arable unit area in the study area was CNY 18,047.26  | Topographic position index (TPI): The TPI is a composite reflection of the influence of two topographic factors, elevation, and slope, on the value of ecosystem services. The equation is as follows.
In the Eq. 4, T denotes the topographic position index, E and E represent the arbitrary and average elevation of the study area, and S and S represent the arbitrary and average slope of the study area.
The TPI of the study area is a normal distribution characteristic, and the Jenks natural breakpoint method is used in the study area. The Jenks natural breaks classification method, also known as Jenks Optimization, is a data classification method used to determine the best alignment of values between classes. This is done by minimizing each class's average deviation from the class mean while maximizing each class's deviation from the means of the other groups  | Results:  | Land use and land cover change (LULCC) analysis: Land use status in the study area for 2015 and 2020 (Table  | Landscape pattern change analysis: The LPI represents the proportion of the maximum plaque area to the total area, allowing for identifying dominant types (Table 
At the landscape level (Table  | Time-change analysis of ecosystem services value: In KDC for 5 years, the value of ES in the study area has increased by CNY 63.45 √ó 10 4 , with the most significant increase being in the transfer of services (Table 
Implementing KDC projects such as artificial afforestation, returning farmland to forest, and forest closure has increased the amount of tree woodland, shrub woodland, and orchard land. The expansion of these three types of landscapes has positively affected provision services, regulating services, support services, and cultural services, and has contributed to the ecological recovery of karst areas. | Spatial analysis of the value of ecosystem services: In the last 5 years of KDC, the spatial variation of ESV in the study area fluctuated wildly. The increase or decrease was more significant, indicating that the value of ES in the study area did not form a stable trend and ES could be more stable. This also indicates that the karst village ecosystem is highly susceptible to external interference and has vulnerabilities. The areas where changes in ESV show decreasing trends are mainly in the north-western region and the eastern region of the study area, while the south-western region shows an increase in ESV (Figure 
The services are classified according to the value per unit area on different TPI gradients. Provision services show an inverted U-shape as the TPI increases, reaching a maximum in the TPI III gradients. Regulating, support and cultural services all increase with the TPI, and the total service value follows the same trend (Figure 
4.2 Enhancing the supply capacity of village ecosystem services and promoting the economic transformation of service values is a win-win path to ecological restoration and economic development in karst desertification areas
This study corrects the equivalent value factor for ES. The value per unit area in 2015 and 2020 is  | 4.3: The TPI provides a spatial reference for enhancing the value of village ecosystem services
Existing studies have more often analyzed and elaborated spatially on ecosystem services with the help of orientation. This approach only elucidates the spatial distribution characteristics of ecosystem services in this one location, does not reveal the universal characteristics of similar study areas, and lacks guidance. The TPI can reflect spatial characteristics well. The spatial significance can be uncovered by using it to elaborate on the spatial characteristics of ecosystem services. The nature of the spatial distribution of ecosystem services can be revealed to dissect the spatial distribution characteristics of village ecosystem services in the study area and extend the result to other areas of the same type. The village ecosystems in this study show different characteristics of change in service value at different TPI gradients. The value of provision services shows an inverted U-shaped distribution as TPI rises, peaking at gradient III, a feature inconsistent with findings in other karst regions  | Limitations: There are some possible limitations to this study. Firstly, the land use data in this paper were obtained by interpreting remote sensing imagery. This method can only identify two-dimensional space. However, tree forests, shrublands, and grasslands may coexist in three-dimensional space. Only tree forests can be identified if this situation exists, and information on shrublands and grasslands will be lost, leading to an underestimation of the value of village ecosystem services. The future of remote sensing interpretation should be a breakthrough in three dimensions. Secondly, the research context of this paper is the karst plateau mountains and targets village ecosystems with potential-light KDC. Due to the high heterogeneity of karst areas, the findings of this study may be more applicable to village ecosystems with characteristics consistent with this paper. Future research on KDC in village ecosystems should be increased, especially comparative studies between different village ecosystems. | Conclusion: Based on dynamic changes in LULC, this paper investigates the landscape pattern and EVS of potential-light KDC village ecosystems in the karst plateau mountains using the land use matrix method, the landscape pattern index, the TPI, and the modified value equivalents. It bridges the gaps in the field at village scales, in rural environments, and in the context of KDC, and provides a reference about KDC for research on ES. Based on the findings and discussions, we conclude the following. Firstly, during the period of KDC, the vegetation types of the village ecosystems in the karst plateau mountains with potential mild KDC are in positive succession, and the land use is dominated by woodland, or-chard, and construction land, while the area of dry land and grassland shows a decreasing trend. The dominance of shrubland is gradually increasing. The shape of the orchard and construction land types tends to be more complex, while the shape of woodland, grassland, and cropland tend to be more regular. The shape of the landscape also tends to be regular and clustered. Landscape spread and connectivity are increasing, while fragmentation and SHID is decreasing. Secondly, the value of regulation and cultural services has increased over the 5 years, with regulation services making the most significant contribution. However, landscape change has led to a trade-off between services, with a downward trend in the value of provisioning and support services. The supply capacity of village ecosystem services is inadequate due to the offsetting services generated. The total value of ES in KDC villages increased by only CNY63.45 √ó 10 4 , and the value of services was not effectively transformed economically. Thirdly, the value of ecosystem services exhibited different characteristics of variation across topographic space. As TPI increases, the value of provisioning services follows an inverted U-shape, with the remaining services increasing as TPI increases.

"Analysis of Land Use/Land Cover Change and Its Implication On Natural Resources of the Dedo Watershed, Southwest Ethiopia",Mesfin Anteneh,"is study analyzed the land use/land cover (LULC) change and their causes and implications on the natural resources of the Dedo Watershed, Ethiopia. e study used 1984, 2000, and 2017  satellite images to detect the trends of land use/land cover change. Moreover, key informant interviews and focus group discussions were used to identify the driving forces linked to the changes and their impact on the natural resources of the watershed. e study identi ed ve LULC types as follows: cultivation, settlement, dense forest, light vegetation, and grassland. Over the last 33 years, cultivation and settlement land expanded by 15.7% and 0.34%, whereas dense forest, light vegetation, and grazing land declined by 9.2%, 4.97%, and 1.85%, respectively. e establishment of the resettlement program and population pressure and associated demands were the major driving forces behind the land use/cover change. Whereas increased soil erosion, biodiversity loss, and decline in water resources are identi ed as the major impacts of land use land cover changes in the study watershed for the last 33 years. e study concludes that if these trends of cultivation and settlement land expansion allowed continuing, there will be no dense forest vegetation will remain. So, the nding of this study is signi cant.","Introduction: Land use/land cover change (LULCC) is the modi cation of the Earth's terrestrial surface caused by human activities 
Land use/land cover changes (LULCCs) are triggered by the interplay of socioeconomic and natural environmental factors. Inappropriate farming practices, overgrazing, rapid growth in the human population 
Over the last decades, a number of studies conveyed the occurrences of LULC changes, their causes, and the resulting natural resource degradation in di erent parts of Ethiopia  | Materials and Methods:  | Description of the Study: Area. )e study was conducted in the Dedo watershed which is, located in the Jimma Administrative Zone of Oromia National Regional State at about 340 km southwest of Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia. Geographically, it is located between 7 ¬∞5‚Ä≤ to 7 ¬∞45‚Ä≤ N and 36 ¬∞39‚Ä≤ to 37 ¬∞15‚Ä≤ E (Figure 
Subsistence mixed (crop and animal) agriculture is the major means of livelihood in the area with an average farm size of about one hectare (ha). )e common growing crops are maize (Zea mays L.), teff (Ergarostis teff Zucc), rice (Oryza galberrima), and beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Other less important crops include chickpea (Cicer arietinum), potato (Solanum tuberosum), onion (Allium cepa), cabbage (Brassia aleracea), and Chili pepper (Capsicum spp.). Various types of crops such as garlic (Alliium sativum), Ethiopian mustard (Brassica carrinata), oats (Avena sativa), and carrot (Dancus carota sativus) are also cultivated as cash crops. Domestic animal such as cattle, goats, sheep, donkeys, chickens, and bees are kept on a traditional basis. | Data Collection and Analysis.: )is study uses three different sets of Landsat satellite images for the Dedo watershed over three decades 
)ough the images are geometrically corrected, radiometric correction and image preprocessing such as sub-setting and layer stacking were performed before the commencement of the actual classification. All the acquired satellite images were enhanced using histogram equalization and haze redaction to improve image quality. In situ data (ground truth points) were collected from the field for image classification and accuracy assessment. In order to identify the major driving forces of LULC changes and other nonvisual information that could not be extracted from the satellite images, focus group discussions (n ÔøΩ 3), with 4 to 6 participants from the local elderly, local community leaders, and agricultural extension workers were organized. In addition, key informants (n ÔøΩ 24) from the local people were interviewed to receive additional insights on issues related to LULC changes. | Data Analysis.: A pixel-based supervised image classification with a maximum likelihood classification algorithm was used to classify the land-use/cover types of each reference year 
where r is the number of rows in the matrix, X ii is the number of observations in row i and column i (the diagonal elements), x + i and x i + are the marginal totals of row r and column i, respectively, and N is the number of observations. )en, the LULC changes between two periods (i.e., 1984 to 2000 and 2000 to 2017) were quantified. Change analysis was conducted using the postclassification image comparison technique, which was used in order to minimize possible effects of atmospheric variations and sensor differences with spatial resolution 
where LUI ÔøΩ the annual rate of change in area for the land use classes. Hence, positive values suggest an increase whereas negative values imply a decrease in the extent of LULC. In addition, a change detection matrix of ""from-to"" was derived to show LULC class conversion transitions during the 33-year period by overlaying the 1984 and 2017 classified maps. Image classification accuracy assessments and change analysis were undertaken in ArcGIS10.3 software. )e datasets collected about the causes of LULC changes from FGD and key informants were analyzed qualitatively and triangulated with secondary data and the result of LULC. Based on this information, five land use classes were identified (Table  | Result and Discussion: 3.1. Land Use/Cover Classification. )e land use/cover trend analysis made for the two consecutive periods 1984 to 2000 and 2000 to 2017 has indicated that the watershed was exposed to considerable land use changes (Figures  | Cultivation Land.: During the entire period, the area under cultivated land increased persistently from 21.4% (21913.56 ha) in 1984 to 28.2% (28925.48 ha) in 2000 and 37.1% (37991.28 ha) in 2017 (Table  | Light vegetation: Areas covered with shrubs, bushes, and small trees, with useful wood, mixed with some grasses. In this study, this land cover class includes agricultural plantation (such as coffee and chat enset) horticultural plantation (such as fruits, ornamental shrubs, and trees, and vegetable gardens), and agrohorticultural plantation. | Grazing land: Grassy areas are used for grazing. | Cultivation land: Areas of land that is ploughed and/or prepared for raising both annual and perennial crops. | Settlement: Small rural communities and other built-up area.   )e Scientific World Journal 5 considerable decline as opposed to the increment in cultivated and settlement land use. Similarly, in the period between 2000 and 2017, the land under grazing land has shown a declining trend with a value of 17097.78 ha to 1615 ha, respectively )is can be attributed to the rapidly growing demand for cultivated and settlement land for other land uses in that specific period.    | Settlement:  | Causes of Land Use Land Cover Change.: Based on the results of key informants and focused group discussions (FGDs), LULC changes in the study watershed were caused by various factors. However, the establishment of the resettlement program and the ever increasing of population pressure were among the major ones. )ese causes are also reported in regional and national documents (e.g., Bureau of Agriculture  | Resettlement Program.: )e resettlement program was mentioned by the FGD participants and key informants as one of the important factors behind the changes in the study area. )ey described the resettlement program that took place in the 1980s in the study watershed led to the clearing of forests to acquire new agricultural and settlement land.
)ey also mentioned that as a result of the resettlement program there was huge loss of forests within which indigenous trees were removed due to selective logging for house construction, fuel wood, and expansion of crop production. Juniperous procera, Millettia ferugunea, and Ximenia ameriicana, and species of Acacia were among the woody species that were seriously affected. )e thousands of homes in the Dedo watershed and its surroundings were also good indicators of the extent of the forest destruction. For example, there were about 1870 housing units in 1986 
)is figure grew to 4,058 homes in 2009  | Population Pressure.: Change in population size, distribution, and associated demographic characteristics are often considered the most important factors affecting land use distribution and change  | Implications of the Observed LULC Change on Land Resources:  | Implications of Soil Erosion.: Land use/cover change is one of the most important factors that govern the surface runoff, rate of soil erosion, and sediment yield from the catchments  | Implication on Hydrological: Regimes. )e change in LULC significantly alters the hydrological fluxes such as runoff response, availability of water resources, and the environment on a local and global scale 
)e Scientific World Journal cultivation, could reduce the infiltration rate and percolation of rainwater to recharge streams, springs, and underground water. Overgrazing caused by the shrinking of grazing land causes compaction, which may lead to reduced infiltration rates. It is relevant to mention Lake Haramaya of eastern Ethiopia which disappeared, due to deforestation and clearing of land for farming activities in its surrounding watershed 
)is reasonably calls for the need for more effort on the balancing of the land use/cover change in general and investments in sustainable land management activities in particular so as to adjust the hydrologic-related disorder occurring in the watershed. | Implications for Biodiversity.: Land use/cover and habitat loss are widely known as the principal causes of biodiversity depletion in Ethiopia 
)us, the conversion of forest land to other type of land use caused numerous negative impacts on the ecosystem, as well as the livelihood of the society in the study area. | Conclusions: )is study examined LULC changes, their driving forces, and implications on land resources between 1984 to 2017 in the Dedo watershed, southwest Ethiopia. Remote sensing and socioeconomic data sources were used as major input for the study. )e results showed that there have been substantial changes in LULC in the Dedo watershed and its adjacent agroecosystem. )e major changes were expansions of cultivation and settlement land and a decline in grazing, dense forest, and light vegetation land use/cover categories.
)e results indicated that dense vegetation land cover was among the most affected land cover with nearly 14.7 and 23.64% of its total area converted into other LULC types between the 1984 to 2000 and 2000 to 2017 periods, respectively. Cultivation land showed significant change over the entire analysis period with a nearly 15.7% increment. )e study also indicated that socio-economic factors mainly population pressure and the establishment of resettlement programs were major driving forces in land use/cover change. Such a situation has critical implications for the deterioration of natural resources such as biodiversity loss, soil erosion, and a decline in the amount of water resources. Conservation and management of natural resources in the study area are not adequate to alleviate the problem of local land degradation. As a result, the livelihood of the local community and the normal function of the ecosystem is under threat. )is apparently tells us that it will continue to be a development challenge for the watershed and the nation at large. )us, sustainable land management is vital to remove unsustainable practices and create a sustainable environment for all concerned. )erefore, overall watershed management is essential to safeguard an environment that will result in sustainable natural resource management and development in all dimensions of the study watershed.","Detection and analysis of land-use and land-cover changes in the midwest escarpment of the Ethiopian rift valley (, , , 2012) || Change detection techniques (, , , , 2004) || Land cover change under unplanned human settlements: a study of the Chyulu hills squatters, Kenya (, , , , , , 2011) || Land use and land cover change in the Bale mountain eco-region of Ethiopia during 1985 to 2015 (, , , 2016) || Socio-economic driving forces of land-use change in Kunshan, the yangtze (, , , , ) || Online Library for rules of use;

Global land use changes are four times greater than previously estimated,Karina Winkler; Richard Fuchs; Mark Rounsevell; Martin Herold,"Quantifying the dynamics of land use change is critical in tackling global societal challenges such as food security, climate change, and biodiversity loss. Here we analyse the dynamics of global land use change at an unprecedented spatial resolution by combining multiple open data streams (remote sensing, reconstructions and statistics) to create the HIstoric Land Dynamics Assessment + (HILDA +). We estimate that land use change has affected almost a third (32%) of the global land area in just six decades (1960-2019) and, thus, is around four times greater in extent than previously estimated from long-term land change assessments. We also identify geographically diverging land use change processes, with afforestation and cropland abandonment in the Global North and deforestation and agricultural expansion in the South. Here, we show that observed phases of accelerating (~1960-2005) and decelerating (2006-2019) land use change can be explained by the effects of global trade on agricultural production.","Untitled Section: A bout three-quarters of the Earth's land surface has been altered by humans within the last millennium 
Yet, in spite of its societal relevance, understanding how global land use/cover (LUC) has changed across space and through time is limited by a lack of comprehensive data and the large uncertainties within existing LUC reconstructions 
Even in the age of satellites, 'big data' and a growing trend of opening access to information, LUC data are still constrained by fragmented content, varying scales, a lack of spatial or temporal detail and inconsistent time series 
Existing global, long-term land use reconstructions often rely on only a few observational data streams and are built on assumptions concerning, for example, the allocation of cropland (HYDE3.2 
To analyse and better understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of global land use change, we combined multiple, high-resolution remote sensing data (see Supplementary Table 
In this paper, we present the gains and losses in major LUC categories, identify different land use change patterns and compare these across the globe. | Results and discussion: Spatial extent and diverging patterns of global land use change.
We estimate that 17% of the Earth's land surface has changed at least once between the six land categories from 1960 to 2019 (see Fig. 
We identify a global net loss of forest area of 0.8 million km¬≤, but an expansion in global agriculture (i.e. cropland and pasture/ rangeland) of 1.0 and 0.9 million km¬≤, respectively. However, the global trends in land use change conceal many regionally different trajectories. Whereas forest areas in the Global North (including China) have increased, forest areas in developing countries of the Global South have strongly decreased. The North-South difference in gains and losses of forests, is the opposite for global cropland areas, which have decreased in the Global North and increased in the Global South. The difference between North and South is less pronounced for pasture/ rangeland change, since pasture expansion both in China and Brazil accounts for a major part of the global land area (see Fig.  | Gross change:  | Net change: By separating land use change into areas with a single change (e.g. deforestation) or multiple change events (e.g. crop-grass rotation), we see clear patterns across the globe (see Fig. 
Temporal dynamics of global land use change and its relation to globalised markets. The rate of global land use change was not constant over time. In analysing the temporal dynamics, we identify two different phases: (1) an acceleration phase with an increasing rate of change from 1960 to 2004; and (2) a decreasing rate of change from 2005 to 2019 (see Fig. 
However, the data suggest a rather abrupt change to decreasing rates of land use change in the period from 2005, which is most evident in Africa and South America (see Fig. 
Aside from globalised trade, other important drivers of land change dynamics, which have increasingly influenced the rate of land use change during the deceleration phase, are climate change and its associated impacts such as extreme events, drought and floods. Agricultural land use has been affected by droughts in West 
When analysing the temporal dynamics of global land use change per LUC category, we find large annual variability in agricultural land use change. While global forest area shows a rather steady annual net decrease, which accelerated during the 1990s (see Fig. 
Comparing the rate of global land use change. Comparing the HILDA + annual change rates with previous land use reconstructions (see Fig. 
Land cover change rates derived from higher-resolution remote sensing datasets such as Hansen GFC 
Since HILDA + is built on multiple heterogeneous datasets, errors inherent in single datasets are attenuated during the change allocation procedure. By harmonising multiple information in the change allocation procedure, we build on a confluence of evidence. Thus, HILDA + can be seen as a synthesis product of quality-tested, recognised LUC datasets. To assess the uncertainty of HILDA + maps of global land use change, we analysed the agreement of the used input datasets and the area fraction for each indicated LUC category on an annual basis (see Supplementary Table 
The results of the HILDA + land use change reconstruction show how synergistic information from Earth Observation data, reconstructions and national statistical inventories can be used to identify the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of global land use change at unprecedented levels of detail. This study shows the benefit of using multiple, data-driven resources, which is needed for comprehensive land change assessment at a global scale. This gives more detailed insights into both the spatial patterns and the temporal dynamics of land use change across the Earth. We identify diverging processes of deforestation and agricultural expansion and demonstrate that the rate and extent of global land use change is responsive to socio-economic developments and disruptions such   | Methods: We reconstructed LUC change dynamics for six LUC categories (urban, cropland, pasture/rangeland, forest, unmanaged grass/shrubland, sparse/no vegetation) based on multiple sources of observational data, from which country-scale change extents and mean fractional area were derived per 1 √ó 1 km grid cell from 1960 to 2019. We calculated the country-and year-specific areas of change for each land transition between these categories. A base map for the year 2015 served as a starting point for the change allocation procedure, which, at first, runs backward in time (2015-1960) and, subsequently, forward in time (2015-2019). For each time step and country, LUC change was allocated to selected candidate pixels by using ranked gridded class fractions and the data-derived change extents. Each of these iterative procedures yielded a global LUC map, which served as the new base map for the next time step. A visualisation of the HILDA + reconstruction framework, which evolved from the approach of the HILDA over Europe 
Pre-processing of remote sensing-based LUC data. The HILDA + reconstruction was derived from multiple, openly available global, continental, regional and national LUC datasets (see Supplementary Table 
Harmonisation of LUC maps. We defined a common generalised classification scheme for harmonising the remote sensing-based LUC products. The classification scheme was based on six LUC classes that aim to encompass the major land use changes caused by people and, at the same time, to find a common ground for the input datasets that differ in thematic detail. This classification relates to the FAO land use definitions 
For those years when no observational datasets were available, remote sensing products with a sufficiently long time series (ESA CCI, MODIS MCD12Q1, GLAD UMD VCF) were back-casted in a stepwise manner, based on a linear extrapolation of the mean trend of the first five observed values in time.
Probability maps for LUC categories. For each of the harmonised land cover categories (see Supplementary Table 
Based on the resulting maps of area fractions, we derived probability maps for our final LUC categories (see Supplementary Table 
For separating managed from unmanaged grasslands, we first combined the maps for grassland and shrubland by calculating the mean of their area fractions. We used the resulting maps as probability layers for LUC category 5: Unmanaged grass-/shrubland. For generating the probability layers of LUC category 3: Pasture/ rangelands, we used the Gridded Livestock World v3 (GLW, see Supplementary Table 
Base map calibration. We used the recently released Copernicus LC100 Global Land Cover map for the reference year 2015 to generate a base map for the subsequent reconstruction of LUC change. After reclassifying the map into the generalised land cover categories (see Supplementary Table

The absolute matrices of LUC change, and the land area in each LUC category that changes into another category in a specific country and year, were generated from two different data streams: FAO statistics and remote sensing products. First, we prepared tables of FAO land use area 
Change calculation. We derived net changes in the categories 2: Cropland, 3: Pasture/rangelands and 4: Forest from the FAO land use inventories (Arable land and Permanent cropland, Permanent meadows and pastures, Forest), applying the relative changes to the areas from the base map, respectively. We used the base map and the relative population development from FAO (Total population) as a proxy for net urban area change (LUC 1: Urban areas). The remaining land portion (FAO land area minus Urban, Cropland, Pasture/rangelands and Forest area) was divided proportionally into LUC category 5: Unmanaged grass/shrubland and 6: Sparse/no vegetation according to the area ratio of these categories in the base map.
During the change allocation procedure, a new transition matrix including all gross changes between the LUC categories was iteratively built for each time step, each country and each land transition based on the minimum ratio of gross change to class area from the data-derived country-specific mean transition matrix. This ratio represents the average share of land under a specific LUC category that is converted to another category, either a gain or a loss in LUC category.
Change allocation. Based on the recalculated country-and year-specific transition matrices, the magnitude of LUC change was distributed over the grid by means of corresponding probability maps for each LUC category. This was carried out in three consecutive steps: First (round 1), change was assigned if the respective LUC categories held the highest area fraction and were greater than 0.1. Second (round 2), if no candidate pixels were found in round 1, change was allocated to grid cells where the area fraction of the respective LUC category was greater than 0.4. Round 3 applied if no candidate pixels were existent after rounds 1 and 2. In the end, no changes were allocated in this step. This procedure was undertaken iteratively for each year (in a back-and forward mode starting from the base year 2015, respectively), for each individual country and for each land transition between two LUC categories. The output of each change allocation step of the annual loop was a new global map of LUC, which served as the base map for the next processing step.
Change analysis. The output of the HILDA + change allocation procedure are annual maps of global LUC states (the distribution of LUC categories) and transitions. The transition layers served as the basis for analysing spatial extent, patterns, rates and dynamics of global land use change. Looping through all transition layers, we classified the coded transitions into change and non-change events and counted their occurrence per pixel. The sum of all change occurrences represents the total amount of gross LUC change for the study period. Similarly, LUC category-specific changes were derived by classifying the coded land transitions into gain, loss or stable/non-change events within the respective LUC category. Again, we summed up the occurrences of the different events iteratively through time. Based on the resulting frequencies, we assigned LUC category-specific change on the global grid: gain (single change event), loss (single change event), both gain and loss (multiple change events).
Uncertainty assessment. In order to analyse the uncertainty and assess the reliability of the resulting HILDA + dataset, we derived annual layers of uncertainty information based on the available input LUC datasets. The number of available datasets, the maximum deviation in class area fraction and the mean class area fraction from all available datasets per year were used to generate per-pixel quality information. Based on the multi-year mean of dataset agreement (maximum deviation) and class coverage (mean class area fraction), global quality flags were derived and mapped across the globe (see Supplementary Table

Remote Sensing of Environment,Marco Calder√≥n-Loor; Michalis Hadjikakou; Brett Bryan,High-resolution wall-to-wall land-cover mapping and land change assessment for Australia from 1985 to 2015,"Introduction: Land cover has a significant influence on ecosystem function at all spatial scales, from global to local (e.g. 
Land change assessment relies mainly on the availability of classified spatial information, usually supported by ancillary variables 
Advances in land change monitoring are occurring rapidly in response to the increasing availability of high and medium-resolution satellite imagery 
The classification of raw spatial imagery is commonly performed by employing supervised classification methods 
Australia-the focus of our study-is a country with a heterogeneous landscape and complex land change processes. Major transformations in the Australian landscape began after European settlement, driven by ""‚Ä¶ [An] unrestricted access to land, technological change and growth in productivity and population"" 
Here, we present the first consistent, high-resolution, long timeseries, wall-to-wall analysis of land-cover and land change for Australia. Using a combination of cloud-based (i.e., GEE) and local computational workflow, we mapped land-cover at 30-m resolution across the entire Australian continent at five-yearly time-steps from 1985 to 2015 by analyzing 281,962 Landsat scenes. The main objectives of this work were to: (i) develop a consistent set of historical land-cover and uncertainty maps at high-spatial resolution for an extended time period covering significant changes to the Australian landscape; (ii) identify land-cover change patterns at national and local scale; and, (iii) assess the accuracy of the land-cover and land change mapping over large areas. Because no historical ground-truth data are available for Australia, we used the Dynamic Land Cover Dataset v2.1 (DLCD)  | Methods:  | Study area: The focus of this study is continental Australia, with an area of 7,688,287 km 2 , comprising 89 bioregions and 419 subregions  | Land-cover classification: Our wall-to-wall land-cover classification for Australia combined cloud-based and local computing approaches to pre-process, classify, validate, post-process, and analyze land-cover and land change (Fig.  | Landsat data and other predictor variables: We used 281,962 atmospherically-corrected Landsat scenes to map land-cover including Landsat 5 (123,299 scenes), Landsat 7 (120,134 scenes), and Landsat 8 (38,529 scenes). At each  | Pseudo ground-truth data: We used an interactive, semi-automated process for constructing a pseudo-ground truth training and validation dataset. First, we digitally sampled a total of 150,000 pixels via stratified (strata = DLCD landcover class) random sampling. Pixels were scattered across Australia | Table 2: Ancillary variables included in theyearly composites. Dots represent the temporal aggregation of the variables tested for the land-cover classification. Variables highlighted in grey were used as final predictors in the land-cover classification process.
Where: Y: Year; DJF: December, January and February; MAM: March, April and May; JJA: June, July and August; SON: September, October and December; FS: First semester; SS: Second Semester. Sources: 1 Landsat 5, 7 and 8. USGS; covering all the six land-cover classes. We used the raster package 
Due to the spatial resolution of the DLCD, the reference year and its intrinsic uncertainties, overall accuracy = 82%, we employed an outlier detection method based on the spectral characteristics (at 30-m resolution) for eliminating potentially mislabelled pixels from the pseudoground truth dataset. We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  | Supervised classification: We used a random forest (RF) classifier 
We tested, on a local computer, hundreds of different combinations of ancillary variables as predictors. After running a RF model for every subset of variables (size and bands were randomly selected) in the training dataset, we selected the most parsimonious model, i.e., the model with fewest variables (to avoid computational limits in GEE) and the highest observed accuracy as measured against the validation dataset. We used the caret 
To avoid overfitting and to increase the robustness of our classification we used the mode of ten different RF classifications as the mostlikely land-cover classification for every pixel and every time-step. Based on the k-fold cross-validation method used for assessing the uncertainty of a model estimation  | Post-classification: Approximately 6 7 land-cover change combinations are possible in our study period, some less likely than others, which difficult the establishment of a robust set of transition rules for ensuring the temporal consistency of the classifications. Hence, we decided to take a transparent approach and minimise the amount of postprocessing, but also providing the user with the ability to implement their own postprocessing. Only one post-classification process was implemented where all pixels classified as Built-up areas outside of urban centres defined by the 'Urban Centre and Localities' (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2016) layer were reclassified as Other. These maps present a transparent landcover classification and, in combination with the two per-pixel confidence layers (see Section 2.3), can be further post-processed and refined according to user preferences. Land-cover transitions and land change was calculated after this post-classification correction (see Section 2.3). | Accuracy assessment and land-cover change analysis: Using the validation dataset we calculated seven confusion matrices (one per epoch) for determining the overall, producer, and user accuracy (OA, PA, and UA, respectively) of land-cover classifications, after the Built-up area correction 
Where H represents the entropy, n the number of independent classifications and P i the probability of a given land-cover class. We established three levels of entropy: low, medium, and high when a pixel was mapped as the same land-cover in at least seven, five, and three cases, respectively. The second per-pixel confidence measure was the margin of victory, defined as the difference between the two most common landcover classes among the ten runs 
For assessing the accuracy of land-cover change represented by our maps, we conducted a random validation of 1800 pixels in six sites with diverse landscape mosaics, as suggested by 
In every site, we visually checked the land-cover classification of 300 pixels, sampled in a stratified random approach, and the land-cover transitions (if any) across the years. We used Google Earth Pro¬Æ for assessing the temporal dynamics of every pixel. We then built binary confusion matrices for assessing whether land change or the lack of it had been correctly identified. Following Foody (2010), we calculated the: 1) sensitivity (S 1 ), that is the proportion of pixels correctly classified as having changed (Eq. 15); 2) specificity (S 2 ), that is the proportion of pixels correctly classified as having not changed (Eq. 16); and, 3) prevalence (Œ∏), that is the proportion of pixels that changed in the period of comparison (Eq. 17) (Table 
Post-classification land change assessment between two time-points can often lead to erroneous estimations of change  | Results:  | Land-cover classification: A consistent time-series of seven high spatial resolution land-cover maps was created for Australia for the period 1985-2015 at five year time steps (Fig. 
At a land-cover class level, accuracies were more variable. For instance, the producer accuracy for 2000 varied from 86.2% to 98.6% for Grasslands and Built-up, respectively, whereas the user accuracy varied from 82.1% to 99.4% for Grasslands and Water, respectively. The same pattern was found for other years, with Grasslands and Other areas having the lowest user and PA (>82%) (see supplementary materials, Table 
Fig.  | Land-cover change: Land-cover transitions over the period of study showed that approximately 6.7% (¬±0.9%) of the total Australian territory experienced definitive land-cover change. Built-up areas experienced the highest relative increase of 19.2% (¬±3.1%) by 2015 compared to its extent in 1985, expanding mainly into former Grasslands (~ 2152 km 2 ) (Table  | Table 4: Binary confusion matrix for estimating the accuracy of land-cover change classification in terms of sensitivity (S 1 ), specificity (S 2 ) and prevalence (Œ∏). Modified from 
The sensitivity for capturing change in land-cover at the national level was 96.4%, whereas the specificity for representing no-change was 68.3% (Table  | Discussion: We have developed a consistent time-series of seven high spatial resolution (30-m) land-cover and uncertainty maps for the period 1985-2015 for continental Australia. We show that an error-adjusted area of 510,975 km 2 (¬±69,877 km 2 ) of Australian land changed at a rate of 17,033 km 2 yr -1 (¬±2329 km 2 yr -1 ).  | Interpretation of land change in Australia: Land change has occurred heterogeneously across Australia and between land-cover classes. For instance, Croplands continuously declined in area until 2005 when Grassland transitioned to Cropland and Forest, increasing Cropland extent mainly in Queensland and Victoria. Increases in population and population density, access to markets, and climate conditions are likely to have influenced these cropland dynamics 
Our definition of Grassland included pastures (managed and unmanaged), chenopods, tussock grasses, and hummock grasses covering around 66% of the Australian land mass and making this class the dominant land-cover class in the country. Changes in Grasslands appeared to be a response to changes in other land-cover classes. At the national level, Grassland increased in extent because of losses in Forest and Cropland (Table 
Built-up areas experienced the highest relative increases across the country at around 19% over the study period. Increases in population coupled with low population densities, growth in GDP and incentives for infrastructure construction have all influenced the magnitude and direction of urban growth 
Water presented 5.8% (¬± 1.4%) increase in area from 1985 to 2015. This apparent increase is most likely to result from temporal dynamics in lake area resulting for seasonal wetting and drying (e.g., salt lakes). Other areas also displayed increases, but it was not possible to discriminate between classification error and actual changes as these areas were commonly confused with other land-cover classes (Table  | Land-cover classification a comparison: Our estimates of land-cover extent for every class differed with the extents reported by the DLCD v2.1 map (Table 
New studies at high-spatial resolution are offering new insights of land-cover extent. For example, recent figures produced by  | Potential application of data and methods, and caveats: Our results provide a comprehensive set of historical wall-to-wall land-cover and uncertainty data layers and land change information for Australia. Until now, national land-cover information for Australia was available only at coarse-spatial resolution (e.g. 
The methodological framework employed, cloud-based and local, for our mapping provides a robust and efficient approach for producing land-cover information over large areas can be readily adapted, refined, and applied elsewhere as it. Until now, multiclass time-series information at this spatial extent and resolution has been limited to a few regions around the globe and lacked uncertainty information at a spatial level 
While we have made every effort to make the landcover mapping process transparent, reproducible, and the error and uncertainty explicit, significant limitations persist. First, although GEE offers a proprietary cloud-computing service, free for research purposes, with unparallel capabilities for handling and analyzing petabytes of geospatial information, as part of the terms of service, GEE may add, modify, or deprecate any of its analytical algorithms or functions which might alter the performance of the analysis (we recommend readers keep abreast of the latest updates in GEE by referring to the API changelog, https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/changelog) or even preclude future replication. Similarly, future reproducibility of the current research will also depend on the existence of remote GEE servers. Studies at smaller scales should consider the use of historical stable archives (e.g., USGS EROS) and reproducible workflows. | Accuracy, uncertainty, and its sources: Besides substantially enhancing the spatial and temporal resolution of the available land-cover information for Australia, our mapping product offers per-pixel confidence information unavailable at national level until now. Our classification performed better for Built-up and Water classes (producer and user accuracy >95%) whereas Grassland and Other areas presented the lowest accuracies (producer and user accuracy >82%). Furthermore, the land-cover extent of every class was unbiased. The omission and commission errors presented similar magnitudes for every class, except for Water where omission errors were slightly higher (i.e., maps identified less area of water bodies than their actual extent), suggesting no systematic under or overestimation. Over time, land-cover maps presented higher omission and commission errors for Grasslands and Forests. Land-cover change accuracy expressed as sensitivity and specificity, differed between the six sites assessed (Table 
Sources of lower accuracies (in the case of Grasslands and Other areas), commission and omission errors, and land-cover change errors are related to the: 1) definition of land-cover classes; 2) reliability of the satellite imagery and sensor limitations; 3) ancillary variables for landcover classification; and, 4) mislabeled training and validation data. We defined our land-cover classes based on the purpose of our mapping, the land-cover classification used as a reference, accepted definitions, technical capabilities of Landsat sensors, and the available information for discriminating similar classes (e.g., Grassland and Cropland). In this context, there is a trade-off between the reliability of the classifier for capturing differentiable classes (e.g., Built-up areas) and those that present similar spectral characteristics (e.g., Grasslands and Croplands). Furthermore, Grasslands and Other areas contain a vast array of spectrally similar sub-classes. For instance, from visual assessment we found common confusion between areas with sparse vegetation and Grasslands (in some areas those are classified as Forest and in other as Grasslands).
Similarly, Other areas (that included salt lakes, bare lands, mines, sand dunes, and wetlands) were often classified as Water, Built-up, or Grassland. While the addition of bioclimatic information (e.g., precipitation and mean temperature) and spectral indices (e.g., EVI, NDWI) at a seasonal level helped to improve the consistency of the classifications, further post-processing is required. Despite the temporal and spectral resolution of Landsat sensors, we managed to have cloud-free and shadow-free composites for every time-step. Because of the size of our study area, computation time and memory limitations in GEE, we restricted the number of ancillary variables (n = 49), descriptive statistics (we used only the median), seasons (n = 7), training (n = 19,552) and validation points (n = 9178), and, the number of k-folds (k = 10) used in the classification process. Although we tested the performance of the classification with different sets of variables on a local computer, we may have omitted/included relevant/redundant variables that could have influenced the final classifications. While increasing the training sample size and the number of folds used in the classification may further increase the accuracy of our results, the effect is likely to be marginal.
Our interactive semi-automated method for constructing an historical set of invariant pseudo-ground truth data performed adequately as we clustered pixels with similar spectral characteristics and retained those that did not change during the period of study. The process had to be complemented with a visual validation for reducing the maximum number of mislabeled pixels, and for ensuring a homogeneous distribution across the country and a robust training and validation dataset. Subjectivity at the moment of deciding the reference class of a pixel could have introduced noise in the training and validation datasets, however, the impact of noise on the final classification should be low 
Each land-cover map has an associated entropy and margin of victory map (Fig.  | Conclusion: We have presented a historical set of seven wall-to-wall land-cover maps for Australia at 30-m resolution at 5-year time steps from 1985 to 2015. The maps are the first-of-their-kind for Australia, and one of only a few available at continental scale. They were created by using more than 281,962 Landsat scenes and have an overall accuracy of ~93%. Per-class producer and user accuracies were above 90% for most land-cover classes illustrating the confidence of our estimates. The results show that ~6.7% (¬±0.9%) of the Australian land mass has experienced land change at a rate of ~17,033 km 2 yr -1 (¬±2329 km 2 yr -1 ). While the main losses occurred in Croplands and Forests, the highest relative increases were experienced by Built-up areas coming mainly at the expense of Grassland losses. Accuracy assessment suggested that the sensitivity for capturing change was 96.4%, whereas the specificity for representing stable areas was 68.3%, i.e., change was erroneously simulated in areas dominated by a mosaic of Forest (especially open forests and tall woodlands), Grassland (tall shrublands), and Cropland. These results can be combined with the uncertainty maps for the design and implementation of postprocessing rules depending on the final users' needs. Similarly, these outputs can be used for identifying areas that require more ground-truth data. By exploiting the capabilities of GEE for analyzing big geospatial data, we have demonstrated that time-series mapping of land-cover over large areas at high-spatial resolution is now possible.

Assessment of variation of land use/land cover and its impact on land surface temperature of Asansol subdivision,Niladri Das; Prolay Mondal; Subhasish Sutradhar; Ranajit Ghosh,"Land use and land cover (LULC) Normalized difference build-up index (NDBI) Normalized difference water index (NDWI) Land surface temperature (LST) a b s t r a c t Economic development is a basic need for the growth of the region and it stimulates the rapid transformation of land use and land cover (LULC) units. Urbanization and industrialization are one of the major factors to increase temperature. Asansol sub-division is one of the important industrial and urbanized regions of eastern India. In this study, two different years viz. 1993 and 2018 have taken for the preparation of LULC and land surface temperature map. The kappa coefficient has been implied in this investigation to assess the accuracy of LULC maps. Temperature maps show that summer and winter surface temperature increases at the rate of 0.15 ¬∞C and 0.19 ¬∞C per year respectively. The result also reveals that temperature mainly increases due to the presence of urban, industrial and coal mine areas. The changing land use and land cover patterns show that the coal mine areas have been increased by 15% and urban areas also increased by 60%. Some correlations have been prepared to show the relationship between Land Surface Temperature (LST) and other spatial indices like NDBI, NDVI, and NDWI, where negative correlation prevails between LST and NDVI also with NDWI, but positive relation exists between LST and NDBI. Lastly, simulation of temperature for the year 2041 has been prepared, which shows that in the upcoming years' temperature may be increased up to 0.21 ¬∞C/year.","Introduction: For proper identification of a region, Land use and Land cover (LULC) is one of the most vital parameters for the proper identification of a region 
Several studies established that there is a strong influence of LULC on surface temperature and reported that the relative rise in LST depends on LULC change especially in the urban centers 
Remote Sensing and geospatial technology are some of the major modern tools for the identification of LULC and extraction of land surface temperature (LST) 
This paper attempt to identify the research objectives: (1) To detect the LULC changes over the last 23 years (2) To assess the Spatial as well as the temporal variation of surface temperature with the changing Land use. (3) To establish the correlation between LST and other spatial indices. | Materials and methods:  | Description of the test area: Asansol sub-division is lying on the Western part of the Asansol Durgapur Planning Area (ADPA). It occupies 836.80 Km 2 areas and had a population of 16.72 lakhs in 2011. The southern and northern part of the study area is bounded by Ajay and Damodar River.
The spatial extension of the study area is present between 23 O 41 00 30 00 N to 23 O 53 0 30 00 N and 86 O 47 0 41 00 E to 87 O 14 0 04 00 E (Fig. 
The test area is experienced by tropical monsoon climate with high temperatures in the summer and dry winter season. The average rainfall is 1408 mm. | Database and methods: LANDSAT TM (path/row: 139/44; spatial resolution 30 m) data of 1995 and LANDSAT 8 OLI (path/row: 139/44; spatial resolution 30 m) data have been acquired from USGS earth explorer. The   
2.2.1. Method for land use and land cover classification from Landsat (TM/OLI) imagery LULC map has been classified with the help of supervised classification using the maximum likelihood method of Image Classification tool in ArcGIS 10.5.
Band 1-5 and band-7 of Landsat-5 TM imagery have been considered for land use classification, but band 6 has been excluded as it denotes thermal band. Contrarily for Landsat-8 OLI imagery, bands 1-7 have been taken into consideration for land use classification. For the preparation of land use and land cover maps, all the bands have been stacked in ArcGIS 10.5 software using image analyst tool, then training sample manager tool has been used to identify the signature of the pixels, for this purpose large number of training samples have been collected randomly from the entire  imagery. The entire procedure for land use classification has been shown through the flow chart (Fig.  | Method of accuracy assessment of land use maps: In this study, accuracy assessment has been made through the confusion matrix or error matrix. This matrix explains the information about the actual and predicted identification of the pixel

But the extraction process of LST from Landsat TM and Landsat OLI is slightly different in terms to calculate spectral radiance (Lk). The procedures for the extraction of LST has been described in detail by many articles 
where BT = At-satellite brightness temperature Lk = TOA spectral radiance [vide equation ( 
Step-V Calculation ground surface temperature.   (1.438*10 √Ä2 m K), r ¬ºBoltzmann constant (1.38*10 √Ä23 J/K), h = Planck's constant (6.626*10 √Ä34 J s), c = velocity of light (2.998 √Ç 10 8 m/s) and e = emissivity (ranges between 0.97 and 0.99). | Methods for calculation of various spatial indices: Land Surface Temperature has been associated with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI).
NDVI is the difference between near-infrared and red reflectance which is the divisible sum of two and it describes vegetation phenology 
where  
where the green band is band 2 for Landsat TM imagery and band 3 for Landsat OLI imagery. Near-Infrared (NIR) band is band 4 for Landsat TM and band 5 for Landsat OLI.
Values of NDWI lie between √Ä1 to 1. In the case of water bodies, NDWI value is >0.5 and smaller values like negative values correspond to vegetation, so it is easy to distinguish water bodies from vegetation. The values range from 0 to 0.2 corresponds to the builtup features.
Remote sensed data help us to calculate the built-up index using the Middle infrared band (MIR) and near-infrared band (NIR). NDBI has been derived using the following equation 
where MIR is the middle infrared band (For Landsat TM it is band 5 and for Landsat OLI it is band 6) and NIR is the near-infrared band (For Landsat TM it is band 4 and for Landsat OLI it is band 5).
The values of NDBI also lies between √Ä1 to +1, where 0 to 1 correspond to built-up and value near 1 indicates a high density of built-up area  | Method to identify the association between LST and other spatial parameters: To understand the influence of the different spatial parameters on Surface Temperature, Pearson's Product Moment correlation has been applied. In this study, raster-raster (e.g. LST and NDVI; LST and NDWI and so on) correlation has been calculated in QGIS 3.8.1 software (Discussed in result and analysis section) using scatter plot tool.   | Method for change detection: Land use and land cover classification of 1995 and 2018 have been compared using the change matrix  | Method to estimate the predicted temperature: It is an important part of the study, where the future temperature has been predicted for the next 23 years through simulation. There are several methods to predict simulated temperature like Artificial Neural Networks, Markov chain, hybrid neural model, regression model, etc  | Result and discussion:  | Land use and land cover change analysis: The LULC maps have been categorized into eight classes viz. settlement, water bodies, coal mines, agricultural land, fallow land, industry, vegetation, and wasteland. In 1995 major coal mines area has been observed in the C2 grid (Figs. 
The accuracy assessment of LULC has also been analyzed with the help of the Kappa coefficient (Vide methodology; equation (4).
For the LULC of 1995, the value of Kappa was 0.81 and for 2018 the kappa value was 0.88 (Table 
Fig. 
At the micro-level, the climate has been changed with the changing of the LULC units. The rate of temperature change is very prominent at the impervious surface  | Impact of water bodies, vegetation and building area on land surface temperature: Other correlations have been studied between LST and water bodies, built-up areas and vegetation. All the maps have been prepared for the winter season as the winter season is cloud-free and low atmospheric haziness. Fig. 
Another important relationship has been observed between NDBI and NDWI. NDBI negatively influences NDWI (Fig. 
The last index that is NDBI or Normalized Difference Built-up Index has a keen impact on ground surface temperature. The relational value between them is 0.93 (Tables  | Predicted temperature for 2041: This section is an important part of the study where temperature of 2041 has been predicted with the help of artificial Neural Network model in Q.GIS (Vide methodology). The predicted temperature reveals that temperature will be increased at the place where coal mines, industries and urban area are present. With the increase of human demand, coal mines, industries as well as urban area will rapidly increased in the test region, so there will be huge chance of increasing temperature of the above mention landuse regions. Both figures viz. Figs.  | Conclusion: This study attempted to find out the fact that the increasing trend of temperature over the land area has been recorded both during summer and winter season. This research also explores that temperature remains above 42 ¬∞C at coal mines, industrial patches, and built-up areas. The changing trend of ground surface temperature depicts that maximum and minimum temperature during the summer season has been increased about 0.15 ¬∞C and    Moreover, the unused fallow land should be converted into vegetation land so that increasing surface temperature will be under control. In the urban areas, more vegetation should be planted and more parks should be constructed with dense vegetation like Chittaranjan. For the implementation of all these things, strict planning must be applied in this region. This may help to control further temperature increase.

"Spatial relationship between land-use/land-cover change and land surface temperature in the Dongting Lake area, china",Jie Tan; ‚úâ De; Qiang Li; Xuelan Tan; Weijun Zhou,"the Dongting Lake area (china) is a climate change-sensitive and ecologically fragile area and plays a crucial role in the regulation of the regional climate. in recent decades, rapid social and economic development has led to increased land use/land cover (LULc) changes in the Dongting Lake area, which affect the surface energy balance and hydrological processes. Its contemporary variability under climate change remains highly uncertain. therefore, we retrieved the Land surface temperature (LSt) from the Landsat 7 data and explored its relationship with the LULC types. The results showed that LST is significantly affected by surface type. LST varied significantly across LULC types, with higher LSTs in built-up land, reed beach land, forest land, and paddy fields than in water bodies, mud beaches, marshlands, and riparian forests. Water bodies play an important regulatory role in reducing LSt and mitigating thermal effects on the ground. The winter LST in the study area increased by approximately 3.5 ¬∞C, which may be related to the decrease in the area of Dongting Lake water bodies, water fields and reed flats after the Three Gorges Reservoir was impounded. Compared with the relationship between the nDVi, DeM, and distance from the water body, the negative correlation between the nDMi and LST was stronger and more stable and had the greatest effect on LST. These insights improve the understanding of the land change consequences on the temporal dynamics of LSt.
Land surface temperature (LST) is a reflection of the energy flow in the interactions between the land surface and atmosphere and between the land surface and biosphere. The change in LST is an intuitive regional climate response to global climate change and has important research significance in agriculture, hydrology, ecology, environment, climate, and biogeochemistry1 1-6 . LULC is the interface between the atmosphere and biosphere for material and energy exchange and has a clear influence on LST. Currently, a wide consensus has been reached on the influence of LULC change on regional climate through various processes, such as water and heat flux between land and air 7 , surface wind speed, and boundary layer turbulence8 
Although the use of meteorological data for regional climate change research has progressed, meteorological data are difficult to obtain, and data accuracy is dependent on the site and the scope of the investigation, resulting in difficulties in achieving large-scale and long-term research. Compared with traditional observation methods used at meteorological stations, monitoring LST with remote sensing offers the advantages of a wide observation range and strong spatial continuity. Thus, this monitoring has developed rapidly in thermal environment","Untitled Section: research 
The Dongting Lake area is a typical water-land eco-fragile zone that has been strongly affected by human activities in recent decades. In particular, the Three Gorges Dam began to impound water on June 1, 2003, which accelerated the shrinking of water bodies and significantly altered the land cover state in the Dongting Lake area, and this process has been accompanied by many discussions about its environmental impacts. Some studies have said the dam has had important impacts on the elements of the regional climate system and the interactions between the land surface and the atmosphere. Specifically, it has changed the distribution pattern of regional precipitation and temperature. To verify the impact of the Three Gorges Dam on environmental changes, especially the relationship between LULC change and LST, we used U.S. Geological Survey Landsat TM/ETM + data to obtain LULC change and winter LST information for the Dongting Lake area in this study. Thus, we could better understand the influence of human activities on regional LST and its response to global warming. The exploration of such regional LULC and climate change patterns and processes can provide a typical case for a larger range of global change studies. | Extraction of LULC change information and inversion of LST: Research areas and data. The Dongting Lake area is located in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (28¬∞30‚Ä≤N-30¬∞20‚Ä≤N, 111¬∞40‚Ä≤E-113¬∞10‚Ä≤E), mostly below 50 m above sea level (Fig. 
To analyse the change in land use/land cover and its impact on LST in the Donting Lake area before and after Three Gorges impoundment of the Yangtze River, we selected 16 remote sensing images from the winters of 1995,  2001, 2004 and 2013 as the main data sources (Table  | Extraction of LULC information.: To reduce the classification error caused by the large study area, we first divided the study area into three parts, namely, the eastern Dongting Lake area, the southern Dongting Lake area, and the western Dongting Lake area. Based on the the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat and actual situation of the study area and the characteristics of the remote-sensing image, we divided the Dongting Lake area's LULC types into nine categories-water body, mud beach, marshland, reed beach land, riparian forest, paddy field, dryland, built-up land, and forest land. According to the high-resolution Google Earth images and field survey, we identified training samples to classified the LULC using the decision tree methodology which is based on the classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm 
LSt retrieval and grading. The single-window algorithm is derived by Qin et al. 29 based on the surface thermal radiation conduction equation, which uses Landsat TM/ETM + data to invert LST. The single-window algorithm has the greatest consistency with the actual measurements. We compared the retrieval results of 2001, 2004, and 2013 with the MODIS temperature products from the same time, and the results indicated a relative error of 2% or less.
where C = Œµ 6 √ó œÑ 6 (Œµ 6 is the surface emissivity; œÑ 6 is the atmospheric transmittance),
T 6 is the land surface brightness temperature, and T a is the mean atmospheric temperature. The values of a in the TM and ETM+ sensors are -67.35535 and -63.18853, respectively, and the values of b are -0.458608 and 0.44411, respectively.
The acquisition time for each image was in the winter. To reduce the influence of other factors, such as rainfall or snowfall, on the LST retrieval results and increase the comparability of the results, we standardized the results of the retrieval using a normalization method. The LST distribution range was standardized between 0 and 1, and the normalization formula is as follows:
where N i is the normalized pixel value; LST i is the retrieval of LST for pixel i; LST max is the maximum LST value in the range; and LST min is the minimum LST value in the range. We graded LST using standard deviation classification and obtained the annual temperature grading of the Dongting Lake area (Table  | Statistical analysis.: Using overlay analysis in ArcGIS software (Esri Redlands, CA), we calculated the mean temperature of each LULC type and the change in the area of each temperature grade. We graded the DEM, NDVI, NDMI and distance from the water body at regular intervals (NDVI and NDMI were in steps of 0.01 m, digital elevation was in steps of 10 m and distance from water body was in steps of 100 m). Then, we used correlation analysis to reveal the relationships between LST and these factors.
where m t is the mean LST value of the whole study area in year t; LST i is the LST value of pixel i; m t,j is the mean LST value of land type j in year t; LST j,k is the LST value of pixel k in land type j; D t,j is the difference between the mean LST value of land type j and the LST value of the whole study area in year t. LST for different LULC types. The mean LST of the Dongting Lake area in the last 20 years increased from 7.13 ¬∞C to 11.01 ¬∞C, an increase of approximately 3.5 ¬∞C, which is consistent with the global warming trend (Table 
correlation between LSt and other factors (nDVi, nDMi, DeM and distance from water body). In terms of the correlation of mean LST with these factors (Fig.  | Discussion: Observational analyses show that the surface temperature changes in China in recent decades have shown significant warming in the north but not in the south, especially in the southwest and parts of the lower Yangtze River  | conclusion: In this study, LST was extracted from Landsat TM/ETM+ data using a single-window algorithm, the differences in LST among different LULC types were analysed, the spatial distribution characteristics of LST and the NDMI, NDVI, DEM, and distance were discussed, their quantitative relationships were determined, and the spatiotemporal distribution laws and influencing factors of LST were clarified. The main conclusions were as follows. (1) The LULC type in the Dongting Lake area has changed significantly, with the area of water body and paddy field declining continuously and the area of built-up land and dryland increasing gradually; these results indicate that the changes in the LULC type in the area are related to the water impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam and the ecological management policies. (2) LST in the Dongting Lake area increased by 3.5 ¬∞C in winter, with differences in LST of different LULC types, LST of forest land and dryland is higher than that of other land types, and the LST of water body is much lower than that of other land types, also is much lower than the mean LST of the study area. In addition, within 300 m to the water body, the closer to the water body, the lower the LST. It suggests that the water body has a moderating effect on the LST and surface thermal effects at a certain distance around it. (3) The NDMI showed a strong negative spatial correlation with LST, while the NDVI, DEM and distance showed a weak spatial correlation with LST. In winter, water vapor plays a major role in altering the pattern of heat distribution on the lower mat, and the NDMI is a valid indicator for thermal environment studies and is more suitable for quantitative analysis of LST. Digital remote sensing methods can not only provide a range of surface temperatures across a region but also demonstrate its spatial pattern. These results have increased the understanding of the consequences of land change on the spatiotemporal dynamics of LST.

"Trees, Forests and People",Tarun Kumar Thakur; Kumar Patel; Arvind Bijalwan; Mammohan Dobriyal; Anirudh Kumar; Anita Thakur; Abhishek Bohra; Jahangeer Bhat,"The present study examines the land use land cover (LULC) and change detection impacts on forest ecosystem in Achanakmaar Amarkantak Biosphere Reserve (AABR -area 626.76 km 2 ) of Central India. Results revealed that there has been a change in AABR land use pattern from 2008 to 2018. The major changes include loss of 19.72 km 2 of vegetation cover in various forest types due to increasing biotic interference and over grazing, conversion of 14.77 km 2 of Dense Sal mixed forest to open mixed forest and cultivable land, and 5.0 km 2 teak plantation and Bamboo brakes to agricultural land. Despite losing many plant species due to anthropogenic pressure, the present study found that the AABR as a unique repository of plant species rich in biodiversity. Many spots of this area are invaded or replaced by exotic species which is causing the loss of ecology and diversity of this region. Based on our study Sal mixed forest reduced by 2.88% (5.23 km 2 ), Dense mixed forest 4.02% (9.54 km 2 ), Teak plantation 6.77% (2.61 km 2 ) and Bamboo brakes reduced by 7.66% (2.34 km 2 ). The study concludes that the Landsat 7 TM and Resourcesat 2A satellite images are the most suitable for studying the LULC change on forest ecosystem of AABR. We advocate that by adopting the rigorous conservation measures, especially in open & dense forest and young under-stocked teak forests can restore the vegetation density and diversity in the area. Moreover, Sal natural regeneration of vegetation would remain crucial, and invasion of exotic species over native species needs to be restored in the forest area. Such findings on major changes occurring in forest ecosystem hold tremendous implications in relation to the welfare of the resource-poor tribal communities who are greatly dependent on the natural resources available in AABR for their livelihood.","Introduction: Undulating geography with anecdotal slopes covered with different forest type's viz. Dense mixed and Sal mixed forests, Bamboo plantations, Teak forest, Open mixed forest and manmade plantations harbor huge amount of diversity in and around the Achanakmaar Amarkantak Biosphere Reserve (AABR). There are many plant species endemic to this area such as Cupressus torulosa, Araucaria bidwilli, Thuja oreintalis, Pinus caribbea etc and are well distributed ( https://www.indianetzone. com/40/achanakmar_amarkantak_biosphere_reserve.htm ). It is a storehouse of many medicinal and aromatic plants, edible plants, nontimber forest products and many other useful plants and harbors different animals which reflect the rich heritage of natural resources 
A number of primitive tribes such as, Gond, Baiga, Panika, Pradhan, Kols etc. are living amidst the thick forests of AABR. Forest based ac- tivities and agriculture is the main sources of livelihood and income of these poor tribal populations in-habiting the AABR 
The research on natural resources assessment of AABR remains limited both qualitatively and quantitatively. In this context, application of the modern geospatial techniques underpins the spatial database that is quite necessary for planning for conservation and sustainable development. Additionally field surveys of the selected areas, the dataset offers ground realities of LULC status and traditional uses of biological resources. Satellite Remote sensing (RS) techniques and ground measurements will provide clear advantages for the LULC pattern in AABR.  | Material and methods:  | Study area: The UNESCO natural heritage site AABR was chosen for research as the biotic interferences have notably increased in the last two decades, causing deforestation and conversion of forest areas to agricultural and open forest area. The study area lies between 22¬∞15 ' N to 22¬∞58 ' N and 81¬∞25 ' E to 82¬∞5 ' E which covers 626.76 km 2 area of the watershed with a mean altitude of 1048 m from ASL. The AABR region is a vast reservoir of biodiversity including a variety of medicinal plants. Besides, this area holds unique geological formations where water resources are created and conserved due to interaction of forest and rocks. For example, interaction between the extensive root network of Sal tree and lime stone bauxite holds water during rainy season and the water is then released slowly through aquifers or minor rivers of this region. Reserve forest and different forest types in the core and buffer zones of AABR enrich the floral diversity of this region. The typical climate of the reserve has summer, rainy and winter. The maximum temperature is recorded in the month of May, while the December month registers the minimum temperature. The south-western monsoons carries rainfall during the months of June to September and mean annual precipitation   is more than 1600 mm. The average of relative humidity is found between 50 to 85%, whereas, the mean temperatures of the area in winter and summer remain 16.1¬∞C and 31¬∞C, respectively. The layout map with an elevation model of the study area is depicted in Fig.  | Data source: Medium resolution of 30 m in Landsat-7 TM of 2008 image and Resourcesat 2A level-1C at 5.8 m high resolution of 2018 image was used for mapping LULC and change detection of Achanakmaar Amarkantak Biosphere Reserve from 2008 to 2018 ( Table  | Pre-processing and classification: The detailed methodological framework and analysis for the entire study are illustrated in Fig.  | Field survey and accuracy assessment: The reference/ground and ancillary data were collected through the field survey as ground control point with the help of GPS and direct lo-cal field measurements for ground verification and which was performed for image classification. The coordinates of the sample points in the field were taken and a total of 50 sample plots were selected for ground survey and 10 sample plots in each forest type. The sample points used in the study area are mentioned in Table  | LULC change detection and analysis: LULC map of 2018 was resampled to the spatial and high resolution of 5.8 m for the classified map and for performing LULC and change detection analysis. A comparison in a pixel-based technique was performed to generate changes on pixel basis for more efficient enchanting the advantages of all the categories. Pairs of two different time series classified images (2008 and 2018) were compared using cross -tabulation in order to find out the information of LULC changes for the periods from 2008 to 2018.

(0.30%), Water bodies was about 6.45 km 2 (1.03%), Agriculture 18.6 km 2 (2.96%), Bamboo Brakes 32.89 km 2 (5.24%), Teak forest area covered 41.15 km 2 (6.56%), Open mixed forest was 92.8 km 2 (14.8%) while, Dense mixed forest and Sal mixed forest had maximum part of the watershed and occupied about 246.5 km 2 (39.32%), and 186.49 km 2 (29.49%) area, respectively. A comparison of the latest classified maps (2018) with that of (2008) suggested crop land, habitation and open mixed forest increasing from 2.96 to 4.38%, 0.30 to 0.34% and 14 to 16.67%, respectively over the last ten years. Interestingly, in 2018 map water bodies was less than 1% (5.29 km 2 ) of the total geographical area, 4.87% area was covered by Bamboo Brakes, and Teak forest area was covered 38.54 km 2 (6.14%) which is reduction in the area with respect to 2008. Similarly, Dense mixed forest and Sal mixed forest types reduced to 66.72% in 2018 against 69% in 2008 due to increasing biotic interference inside the biosphere reserve ( Table 
Medium resolution (Landsat 7 image) and high-resolution satellite images (i.e. Resourcesat 2A image) have been used for LULC changes from 2008 to 2018 of AABR. LULC and changes monitoring and mapping has gradually more standard as few of the most efficient tools for LULC and natural resource management applications. As demonstrated earlier by 
Overall accuracy, using LULC classification in the current study varies from 87.69% to 92.4%, which is in agreement of 
Following the LULC change from 2008 to 2018 in AABR, we could discern notable changes that occurred over the 10-year duration; such as conversion of Dense and Sal mixed forest covers to Open mixed forest and Agricultural land, ecological degradation by anthropogenic activities like slash and burn, overgrazing, overexploitation of MAPs in ground & underground vegetation, encroachment etc., The construction of permanent structure, mining, settlements, water crisis also pose severe pressure on biological resources leading to destruction of habitats of flora and fauna. Many native species are replaced by non-native or exotic species which is affecting the ecology of this region e.g. Sal and Mahua were replaced by tropical Pines and Eucalyptus which is damaging the diversity of AABR.  | Direct field measurement and accuracy assessment: The reconnaissance survey was done for direct field measurements and the LULC maps in 2008 and 2018 were derived from Landsat 7 and Resourcesat 2A satellite data ( Fig.  | Establishing correlations among NDMI with NDVI and EVI: Data on LULC using vegetation indices are represented in Figs. 9 and 10 . The results of change detection as per Normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) revealed in the study area decreased by almost 1.42% ( Table  | Conclusion: AABR has vast forest area with high anthropogenic pressure for resource utilization by tribes and other forest dwelling communities. The decadal LULC changes in the AABR covering an area of 626.76 km 2 in temporal scale from 2008 to 2018. LULC patterns are important in identifying limited resources, and environmentally critical areas from land conversion or human exploitation. The area is predominantly covered with forest vegetation but substantial conversion witnessed in different vegetation classes such as Dense mixed forest and Sal mixed forest in fringe areas of cultivable land and habitation. The field survey in combination with interaction with local communities' reveals that the forest resources are the main source of livelihood which put intense pressure without proper forest management regulations.
We advocate that by adopting the rigorous conservation measures, especially re-vegetation of open forest with indigenous species & augmentation of dense forest by the respective species. To check cultivable land expansion forest farming or ecological farming concepts need to taught to tribals for better livelihood options. Current findings hold tremendous implications in framing biodiversity based livelihood plan for socio economic upliftment of forest dwelling communities. The ethos of ensuring sustainable utilization of the natural diversity in the forest ecosystem is key to mitigate climate change impact.  | Declaration of Competing Interest: Authors declare that they have no competing interests.","Comparative analysis of pixel-based and object-based classification of high resolution remote sensing images -a review (, , , 2016) || Diversity and use of wild and non-cultivated edible plants in the Western Himalaya (, , , , , , 2018) || Object-based land-use/land-cover change detection using Landsat imagery: a case study of Ardabil, Namin, and Nir counties in northwest Iran (, , 2018) || Land use and land cover spatiotemporal dynamic pattern and predicting changes using integrated CA-Markov model (, , , 2016) || Comparison of object and pixel-based land cover classification through three supervised methods (, , , 2017) || Consumption patterns of wild edibles by the Vasavas: a case study from Gujarat (, , , , , , 2018) ||  (, , , , 2019. 1990-2030) || Status of land cover classification accuracy assessment (, 2002) || What drives tropical deforestation?

"Dynamic change of land use/land cover patterns and driving factors of Nansihu Lake Basin in Shandong Province, China",Fang Wang; Xingzhong Yuan; Xiaoping Xie,"Anthropogenic activities and natural factors have a significant effect on land use/land cover (LULC) patterns of Nansihu Lake basin. Understanding the LULC change is essential for regional sustainable development. Based on LULC change detection methods, we characterized the spatial-temporal change of LULC patterns. Logistic regression model and the Conversion of Land Use and its Effects at Small regional extent (CLUE-S) model were used in driving factors analysis and scenario simulation. The results showed that cultivated land and construction land were the dominant LULC types. As construction land gradually expanded to the surrounding areas, a large amount of cultivated land was occupied, especially in the peripheral areas of the central cities. During 1987During  -2017, 4109, 4109.22 km 2 of cultivated land was converted into construction land, accounting for 86.38% of cultivated land change, and the contribution rate to construction land was 95.24%. Because of the severe drought in 2002, waters first decreased and then increased. The dynamic degree of waters reached 2.11%, and the increment of waters was mainly converted from cultivated land and unused land. The degree of LULC fragmentation was strengthened, and the distribution showed a diversified trend. The LULC changes were deeply influenced by natural environment and socio-economic factors. Under different scenarios, the expansion of construction land and occupation of cultivated land will continue to be the main features of LULC changes in the future. The LULC patterns will become more regular and more aggregated. This study can help address the interwoven challenges of urbanization development and ecological protection.","Introduction: Land use is one of the key forms of human impacts on the natural environment, thereby resulting in changes of land cover which provide fundamental information related to the biophysical properties of the earth's land surfaces 
Many LULC pattern metrics have been developed to reflect the LULC structural composition and spatial configuration characteristics 
The Nansihu Lake basin of Shandong Province is a crucial production base of grain, fisheries, coal and energy in both Shandong Province and China as a whole. Some mining activities in the basin started in the 1980s and continue today 
The scale effect of LULC patterns is a prerequisite for accurately understanding its characteristic 
However, LULC change detection methods rarely used at grid scale. We introduce the LULC gradient method, which is based on a grid, can effectively compare the regional differences in LULC patterns change. Therefore, by combining the LULC pattern index, dynamic change index, LULC transfer matrix and LULC gradient, this paper aims to reveal the dynamic change of LULC patterns in Shandong Nansihu Lake basin from 1987 to 2017. The driving factors of LULC patterns were analysed using a logistic regression model. Based on CLUE-S model, the differences in LULC patterns evolution under different simulated scenarios from 2017 to 2047 were further analysed. This study can provide theory support for land management decision-making and urban planning. It can also provide a reference to resolve the contradiction between economic development and land-use balance. | Materials and methods:  | Study area: The Nansihu Lake basin of Shandong Province contains 28 counties and districts of Jining, Zaozhuang, Heze and Tai'an Cities (Fig.  | Data source and processing: Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) images of 1987, 2002 and 2017 were obtained from the Geo-spatial Data Cloud Platform (http://www.gsclo ud.cn/).

and Œ≤ denotes the regression coefficient. The goodness-of-fit of the logistic regression model was evaluated by the relative operating characteristic (ROC)  | CLUE-S model: The CLUE-S model is composed of non-spatial and spatial modules. The non-spatial module is used to calculate the LULC demands by the Markov model. The spatial module translates these demands into LULC changes at different locations within the study area 
The NS was formulated based on the historical LULC changes trends. The LULC demand was simulated using the Markov model at a simulation step of 15 years based on the actual percentages of different LULC types in 2017 and the initial transition probability matrix from 2002 to 2017. The ES and CS were policy-based scenarios, and their LULC demand were calculated using the modified Markov transition matrix 
The conversion elasticity (ELAS) is related to the reversibility of LULC changes, which reflects the ease or difficulty of LULC conversion  | Results:  | Spatial-temporal change of LULC patterns:  | LULC pattern index analysis: At the patch level (Table 
On the whole basin, the ED and PAFRAC displayed a continuous growing trend (Table  | LULC dynamic transfer analysis: As seen in Table  | Regional differences analysis: According to the preliminary analysis, the two main LULC types in the basin were cultivated land and construction land, and waters were the most typical LULC in Shandong Nansihu Lake basin. Therefore, this section used cultivated land, construction land and waters as examples and analysed the regional differences in LULC changes on the basis of LULC gradient (Fig. 
In 1987, cultivated land was densely distributed in most of the basin, except for the central areas of cities, the eastern mountains and Nansihu Lake. The cultivated land with a high DI (80 < DI ‚â§ 100) reached 19,455.61 km 2 , covering 67.13%. The largest distribution area of construction land was the region with DI varying from 10 to 20. The construction land with DI ranging from 50 to 100 accounted for only 0.99%. The waters with a high DI (80 < DI ‚â§ 100) covered 306.2 km 2 , with a distribution mainly in Nansihu Lake. The waters with DI ranging from 50 to 100 covered 631.36 km 2 and were distributed along the Yellow River, Si River, Zhuzhaoxin River and Dongyu River.
In 2002, cultivated land showed an overall decreasing trend. The cultivated land with DI ranging from 80 to 100 decreased by 1915.21 km 2 . The construction land with a high DI (80 < DI ‚â§ 100) gradually emerged in Juancheng, Dongming, Dingtao, Chengwu, Caoxian and other counties. The construction land with DI ranging from 50 to 100 reached 593.24 km 2 , with the areal proportion increasing to 2.05%. A large amount of cultivated land surrounding cities was occupied, and the decrement in cultivated land Fig. 
In 2017, construction land increased significantly, while cultivated land tended to decline. The cultivated land with a high DI (80 < DI ‚â§ 100) decreased by 8166.05 km 2 , and the areal proportion decreased from 67.13% to 38.96%. The construction land with DI ranging from 50 to 100 increased from 287.24 km 2 to 2494.91 km 2 , and the areal proportion increased to 8.61%. The change was more prominent in Mudan District of Heze, downtown Jining and Tengzhou City, where the decrement in cultivated land reached 0.57 km 2 to 1 km 2 within a grid and the increment in construction land reached 0.67-1 km 2 . The waters with a high DI (80 < DI ‚â§ 100) increased significantly, reaching 688.96 km 2 , with a maximum increment in a grid of 1 km 2 , especially in Weishan Lake, Liangji Canal and the junction of Qufu, Yanzhou and Zoucheng Cities. | Driving factors analysis: The Wald statistic represents the relative weight per variable, and it evaluates the contribution of each variable to the event prediction. According to the Wald statistics shown in Table  | Simulation of LULC patterns under different scenarios: The simulations exhibited similar change trends of cultivated land and construction land under different scenarios, i.e., the expansion of construction land generally would mainly occur at the edges of original cities and at the expense of cultivated land. However, there would be marked differences in the magnitude and position of areal change. Under the NS, the change in construction land would be the largest. The conversion would occur mainly in Mudan District, Dingtao and Juye Counties of Heze, Jiaxiang County, Rencheng District, Yanzhou, Qufu and Zoucheng Cities of Jining, Tengzhou City of Zaozhuang and other regions with greater development potential along the main railways and highways. Under the ES, the increase range of construction land would decrease. The most significant change would be observed in Mudan District, downtown Jining and Rencheng District. Under the CS, the rangeability of cultivated land and construction land would decrease drastically. This result revealed that the cultivated land would receive effective protection.
Under the NS and CS, the forestland and grassland would decrease in the eastern mountains, the reduction under the CS would be more variable. The waters would have an increasing tendency, the increment under the CS would be slightly lower. Under the ES, these ecological lands would have an ascending tendency. Among them, the grassland would have the largest increase mainly at the expense of cultivated land, which would sharply increase by 1247.61 km 2 , especially in Juye County, Zoucheng City, Sishui and Ningyang Counties. The forestland would increase mainly in the eastern mountains, such as southern Sishui County, eastern Zoucheng City and Shanting District. Compared to the other two scenarios, the increase range of waters would be the largest under the ES, reaching 291.96 km 2 , focused primarily in Weishan County and western Dongming County. Under the three different scenarios, the change trend of unused land would be basically the same. There would be a decreasing trend mainly on the bank of Nansihu Lake and in the eastern mountains for the tendency of unused land. | Discussion:  | Spatial-temporal dynamic change of LULC patterns: Our results revealed that construction land increased sharply and cultivated land decreased dramatically from 1987 to 2017 in Nansihu Lake basin, waters fluctuated with climate and anthropogenic factors. As a result, cultivated land and construction land were the dominant LULC types. Urbanization and the reclaiming of cultivated land increased fragmentation, heterogeneity and shape complexity of LULC patterns. The rivers and lakes were invaded and replaced by grassland on the river bank and lakeshore due to the severe drought in 2002. Because of the increasing of agricultural irrigation and imperfect urban planning systems, waters decreased from 1987 to 2002. With the promulgation of the water laws of the People's Republic of China in 2002, the occurrence of an abrupt drought-flood transition during the flood season of 2003, the establishment of the Nansihu Nature Reserve, the introduction of the overall land use planning in 2006 and the increase in coal mining subsidence areas, waters showed an increasing tendency between 2002 and 2017.
A novelty of this study is that it reflects the regional differences based on gradient analysis. Our results demonstrated that during 1987-2017, the main change direction involved in cultivated land reduction was the conversion to construction land, and 4109.22 km 2 was converted into construction land, accounting for 86.38% of the cultivated land change; finally, the contribution rate to the construction land was 95.24%. Due to the forms of urban growth, the construction land expanded outward from the original city centre and along the main lines of communication. The largest transformation to construction land occurred in the areas surrounding cities and towns, especially in Mudan District of Heze, downtown Jining and downtown Zaozhuang. These change trends were similar to the findings of  | Driving factors of LULC changes: Generally, LULC changes in Nansihu Lake basin were strongly influenced by natural environment and socio-economic factors. Altitude and slope were negative explanatory variables for cultivated land, construction land and waters, suggesting that the areas with higher altitude and steeper slope were not suitable for the requirements of agricultural production and livelihood. However, the higher distribution probability of forestland and grassland were found at higher altitude and steeper slope. Temperature and precipitation as climatic factors had important impacts on vegetation and waters. A negative correlation was found between temperature and cultivated land, which is consistent with the study of 
GDP, POP and distance to cities were the most important explanatory variables for the construction land distribution. GDP and POP to some extent reflected the regional economic and social development. With the acceleration of urbanization, the urban land demand for infrastructure driving by population growth and economic development increased gradually. The scale of construction land expanded rapidly, which led to a serious loss of cultivated land and a significant LULC change in the peripheral areas of cities. Influenced by the radiating and driving effects of the city centre, with the decrease in the distance to cities, the distribution probability of construction land was increased. The areas surrounding the main roads had become active economic growth areas because of the convenient traffic conditions; moreover, the increase in distribution probability of residential area, township and other construction land led to a remarkable LULC change. Similar studies found that areas with good transport access experience a higher probability of LULC changes 
Coal mining induced surface subsidence and waterlogging in the late 1980s and continue today. The surrounding areas of the coal mines were not suitable for production and livelihood. In addition, policy planning had been considered the important driving factor for LULC changes  | LULC change prediction: The Overall Land Use Planning of Jining, Zaozhuang, Heze and Tai'an Cities emphasize the clusterization of cities, land consolidation and ecological space protection. Compared with the historical LULC patterns and the future development orientation and strategies outlined in the planning, the LULC patterns would become more regular, simpler and more aggregated in 2047, evidenced by the reduction in ED, PAFRAC and SPLIT, and the increase in AI (Fig.  | Conclusions: This study demonstrated the effectiveness of the combined method of LULC pattern index, dynamic change index, LULC transfer matrix and gradient analysis for deciphering the dynamic change of LULC patterns in response to natural environmental and anthropogenic activities. Based on logistic regression model and CLUE-S model, the driving factors analysis and scenario simulation analysis were conducted. The results showed that the basin was dominated by cultivated land and construction land. The areas surrounding counties, cities, districts and main roads became hotspots of LULC changes, which led a large amount of cultivated land to be occupied by construction land. LULC changes were driven by the complex interactions of natural environment and socio-economic factors. Under different scenarios, the expansion of construction land and occupation of cultivated land will continue to be the main characteristics of LULC changes in the future. The LULC patterns will become more regular and more aggregated and the distribution will show a uniform trend. Overall, this study can help identify the characteristics of historical LULC changes and near-future critical locations in the face of the continuous pressure on environment. The results can assist decision-makers in implementing effective protection strategies and sustainable land-use management.
This paper analysed the dynamic change of LULC patterns from the perspective of the grid method, which can compensate for the shortage of expressing the LULC distribution of the study area by using the average value. However, the results will vary with patch sizes. In the future, the scale effect should be fully explored through transforming the grid size in the spatial dimension. Additionally, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the driving factors should be improved. Determining how to integrate policy implementation, values and other dynamic driving factors quantitatively and spatially to construct the driving forces model of LULC changes should be the focus of further research.","2 LULC type maps of Shandong Nansihu Lake basin References (, , , 2019) || Modeling of urban growth in tsunami-prone city using logistic regression: Analysis of Banda Aceh (, , , , 2015) || Mediterranean drylands: the effect of grain size and domain of scale on landscape metrics (, , , , 2011) || Land-use change and land degradation on the Mongolian Plateau from 1975 to 2015-a case study from Xilingol (, , , 2018) || Identifying change trajectories and evolutive phases on coastal landscapes.

"Spatiotemporal change detection of land use land cover (LULC) in Fashiakhali wildlife sanctuary (FKWS) impact area, Bangladesh, employing multispectral images and GIS",Md Sazzad Hossain; Md Asif; Haider Khan; Tomiwa Oluwajuwon; Jayanta Biswas; S Rubaiot; Md Seikh; Sadiul Islam Tanvir; Sirajum Munira; Md Naif; Ahmed Chowdhury; Md Hossain,"Land cover change has posed significant concerns to biodiversity and climate change in Bangladesh and globally. Despite the country's designation of forest regions as protected areas to conserve their valuable resources, deforestation and forest conversion remained unabated. Fashiakhali Wildlife Sanctuary (FKWS), a protected area in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, and its surrounding forested impact area have experienced considerable changes over the years, yet are deficient in extensive assessment. This study evaluated the land use land cover (LULC) changes in the FKWS impact area over almost 3 decades  using multispectral remotely sensed data. The Landsat images of 1994, 2001, 2010, and 2021  were classified using a maximum likelihood algorithm and analyzed for change detection. The comparative potential of vegetation indices, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), in forest cover assessment, and the relationship between Land Surface Temperature (LST) and NDVI was also assessed. A significant forest cover loss of around 1117.17 ha (16%) was recorded in the FKWS impact area between 1994 and 2021, with the hugest proportion of 867.78 ha (12.24%) deforested in the first period (1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001). Agricultural land also declined by 593.73 ha (8.37%) within the entire period, despite its initial increase of 392.04 ha (5.53%) between 2001 and 2010, being the primary driver of earlier deforestation. However, in the recent decade (2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015)(2016)(2017)(2018)(2019)(2020)(2021), settlement expansion of 963.90 ha (13.59%) due to massive human migration in the area contributed to the most remarkable overall land cover change of 1731.51 ha (24.42%). Furthermore, NDVI provided a better and more accurate forest cover assessment than SAVI and was recommended to aid in the quick evaluation and monitoring of the future impacts of agriculture, settlement, and other sorts of land use on the forest cover. In tandem with the widely acknowledged issue of increased temperature due to climate change, an absolute negative correlation was found between the NDVI and LST, confirming the negative impact of climate change on forest loss in the FKWS impact area.

Bangladesh is a small developing nation with a vast population size that was around 147 million as of mid-2007 and is predicted to be 222 million by 2050 
The Fashiakhali Wildlife Sanctuary (FKWS), located within Fashiakhali Forest Reserve, is a protected area in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh and was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 2007 
The land cover describes the physical and environmental characteristics of the land surface area, including the presence of water, crops, forests, constructions, etc. 
Remote sensing is a fundamental approach for studying spatial and temporal changes in LULC 
Moreover, until now, several studies have been conducted to detect changes in LULC of different Bangladesh's hill forests  | Materials and methods:  | Study area: Fashiakhali Wildlife Sanctuary (FKWS) is situated in Cox's Bazar District of Chittagong Division, located in the South-Eastern part of Bangladesh.

ETM + thermal band 6 (10.4-12.5 Œºm), and OLI thermal band 10 (10.6-11.19 Œºm) were used. The first stage involved converting the thermal band digital number (DN) values for each Landsat image, according to the respective sensor types, to sensor spectral radiance using the following formula (Eq. 4) 
where, L max Œª = Maximum spectral radiance scaled The following equation (Eq. 5) is then used to convert spectral radiance to temperature in Kelvin

The forest, water, and agriculture/grassland classes predominantly experienced negative changes, although agriculture/ grassland had recorded a considerable positive change within 2001-2010. On the other hand, the land areas considered bare land and settlement recorded a positive change over the years. The most significant transitions between 1994 and 2021 were found for forest and settlement, with a total of about 16% loss and 24% gain, respectively. Of these changes, the hugest forest change was recorded within the earliest seven (7) years evaluated 
In the recent decade, although the direct conversion of forest for agriculture in the protected area was no longer prominent, there has been continual cultivation of a large expanse of bare land. However, the rate decreased, with settlement expansion becoming the most prominent driver of forest cover loss (300.15 ha) (Table  | Accuracy of classified images: An important step after land cover classification is accuracy evaluation, which defines the validity of the resultant map by assessing the errors for each class and generally for the whole classified image  | Assessment of forest cover based on vegetation indices (NDVI and SAVI): Remotely sensed vegetation indices are straightforward and efficient methods for quantitative and qualitative assessments of vegetation cover, vitality, and growth dynamics  | Land surface temperature of FKWS impact area: Remotely sensed Land Surface Temperature (LST) has become one of the crucial indices to characterize and understand the thermal behavior of the earth cover in response to vegetation changes and associated climate processes  | Conclusion: This study assessed the land use land cover changes in FKWS impact area in Bangladesh within nearly 3 decades  using remotely sensed multispectral imagery.

How Climate Change and Land Use/Land Cover Change Affect Domestic Water Vulnerability in Yangambi Watersheds (D. R. Congo),David Chishug; Denis Sonwa; Jean-Marie Kahindo; Destin Itunda; Josu√© Chishugi; Fiyo F√©lix; Muhindo Sahani,How Climate Change and Land Use/Land Cover Change Affect Domestic Water Vulnerability in Yangambi Watersheds (D. R. Congo).,"Introduction: Many scientists are increasingly noting the influence of land use patterns on the degradation or improvement of water quality 
Given that dense tropical rainforests cover three-quarters of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) 
Unfortunately, as in most sub-Saharan African countries, the rate of access to safe water and sanitation remains paradoxically low 
Mismanagement is often cited to explain water issues in sub-Saharan countries in general-and in DRC in particular 
In Yangambi, an urban-rural area of Tshopo province in DRC, the National Rural Hydraulic Service (NRHS) is struggling to fulfill its mission because of a lack of funds and insufficient capacity to monitor the water resource. The few boreholes for standpipes in certain settlements (Bangala, Lumumba and Ekutsu), drilled in collaboration with partners, are no longer operational. Hence, access to quality water from the water points remains problematic. The population obtains water for its various domestic needs from springs and rivers, which are mostly unprotected.
A survey of 29 water suppliers in the United States by the Trust for Public Lands and the Spring Protection Committee showed that treatment costs are inversely related to the proportion of the watershed protected by forests, wetlands and other open space 
This deterioration of primary forest cover into other LULC types is thus likely a danger to the sustainability of watersheds in terms of water quality regulation 
Many reports by development agencies have noted the degradation of water quality in the region. In response, a careful assessment of the state of domestic water resources at the YBR (Yangambi Biosphere Reserve) is needed. This was proposed in a report by the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) in 2018 
Hence, the objectives of this study are (i) to typologize the watersheds in the Yangambi area in connection with the water physicochemical quality of the rivers in Yangambi; (ii) to verify whether the water physicochemical quality of the rivers in Yangambi meets World Health Organization (WHO) standards; and (iii) to analyze and assess the link between water and climate change adaptation (including vulnerability to climate change). | Materials and Methods:  | Study Site: The study site is in the watersheds (irrigated by the Lusambila, Isalowe, Bonde, Lubilaie and Loweo rivers) of Yangambi in Tshopo province of DRC. It extends over an area of about 430.2 km 2 . The geographical position is between 0 ‚Ä¢ 45 58.1 north latitude and 24 ‚Ä¢ 4 6.13 east longitude, approximately 100 km west of Kisangani. Five main rivers irrigate this study area, of which three (Lusambila, Isalowe and Bonde) are direct tributaries to the Congo River, while the two others (Lubilaie and Loweo) initially flow into the Lobilo stream before flowing into the Congo River (Figure

Many reports by development agencies have noted the degradation of water quality in the region.

It extends over an area of about 430.2 km 2 . The geographical position is between 0¬∞45'58.1'' north latitude and 24¬∞4'6.13'' east longitude, approximately 100 km west of Kisangani. Five main rivers irrigate this study area, of which three (Lusambila, Isalowe and Bonde) are direct tributaries to the Congo River, while the two others (Lubilaie and Loweo) initially flow into the Lobilo stream before flowing into the Congo River (Figure  | Methods:  | Data Collection (a) Watershed delineation and morphometric characteristics: To delineate the five main watersheds in the study area, we used a shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM) file to obtain a digital terrain model. From there, we generated flow directions, flow accumulation raster and talweg segments. With the coordinates of the outlet, these tools helped us produce the raster of the watershed limits. This was then polygonized, to transform it into vectors to bring out the watershed boundaries.
From this watershed vectors shapefile, we generated the morphometric characteristics. These included the area (km 2 ), perimeter (km), Gravellius index (KG), average slope (%), stream length (km), drainage density (km/m 2 ), altitude (m), equivalent rectangle [length (km) and width (km)] and the different altitudes for different areas (hypsometry) within watersheds.
(b) Land use at watershed level We also produced landscape characteristics related to LULC in the watersheds from QGIS version 2.18.18 software. To detect differences in land cover within the watersheds, we downloaded two Sentinel_2B images for the complete study area from http://www. usgs.gov/ (accessed on 7 June and 1 September 2018) (United States Geological Survey). The processing of these two images consisted primarily in their correction. We assigned any clouds perceptible on the images-which could bias the quality of the classificationto the non-data class, i.e., without any appropriate theme. We then created virtual files of these two images. On the latter image, we carried out the random forest supervised classification to generate the different LULC in the Yangambi watersheds. Six training zones were created for each thematic class. The main land uses in Yangambi guided the choice of different training zones. These training zones and the images to be classified were imported into Monteverdi/OTB-6.2.0-Win64 software to generate the classification model and the confusion matrix. Based on this classification model, the Sentinel_2B image was classified into six different land use classes related directly to the different types of LULC in Yangambi. The confusion matrix allowed verification only of the accuracy of the classification performed by the computer. It was used to ensure no overlap between thematic classes. The latter had provided a precision rate of 96%, which was considered acceptable. Before carrying out the analyses, we checked the accuracy of the classification. To that end, we used 50 samples points produced randomly over the entire set of each polygon vector of the different types of LULC in the virtual classified image. We then imported these points into Google Earth to verify whether the thematic classes generated by the supervised random forest classification truly corresponded to the information that characterizes the study environment.
Finally, the LecoS 2.0.7 extension in QGIS version 2.18.18 allowed us to automatically produce landscape composition and configuration indices from the classified image. The following landscape indices were produced: I.
Composition indices: dense forest (DF), perturbed forest (PF), crop land (CL), grass land (GL), and bare soil and residential (BSR). II. Configuration indices: edge density (ED), patch density (PD), great patch area (GPA), mean patch area (MPA) and number of patches for the different composition indices (Table 
We carried out on-site analyses of pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen and turbidity at the site of sample collection following the standard protocols and methods of the American Public Health Organization 
(d) Study of the water resource's vulnerability in relation to climate change We used two different approaches to analyze the climate change vulnerability of water resources in Yangambi: a qualitative approach (based on survey results) and a biophysical approach (based on the meteorological data analysis from the Yangambi station).
The qualitative approach consisted of a survey on the state of water resources (including access, availability, capacity, use and environment) in Yangambi. This was based on the Water Poverty Index (WPI) as proposed by Sullivan and colleagues in 2002  | Data Processing and Statistical Analysis: The fieldwork data were encoded in an Excel spreadsheet. The processing and statistical analysis of the data were done using the same Excel spreadsheet, R software (version R x 64 3.5.1) and QGIS software (version 2.18.18, extension LecoS 2.0.7).
We generated descriptive statistics, including mean, mode, standard deviation and coefficient of variation from the survey data. We performed the Shapiro and Kolmogorov tests to verify the normality and distribution of the data. We then compared the averages of the physicochemical parameters of the water points in the different watersheds based on an analysis of variance (ANOVA). To understand the influence of LULC parameters on water physicochemical quality, we used the Pearson correlation test and simple linear regression (SLR) models. Data with non-normal distribution were log transformed. | Results:  | Watershed Typologies in Yangambi:  | Morphometric Characteristics: The drainage density for all the watersheds varies between 0.5 and 0.6 km/m 2 , with a Gravellius compacity index (KG) value ranging from 1.8 to 2.5 (see Table  | Watershed Typologies in Yangambi:  | Morphometric Characteristics: The drainage density for all the watersheds varies between 0.5 and 0.6 km/m 2 , with a Gravellius compacity index (KG) value ranging from 1.8 to 2.5 (see Table 
All five watersheds are geomorphologically mature as is shown by the general aspect of the hypsometric curves (Figure  | LULC Patterns Related to Anthropization in the Different Watersheds in Yangambi: The classification of the Sentinel 2B satellite image into different LULC types identified five main thematic classes in the five watersheds selected for this study (Figure  | Water Quality in Yangambi for the Main Domestic Water Supplies in the Different Watersheds: Most of the analyzed physical and chemical parameters of water from springs, rivers and cisterns in Yangambi meet WHO standards for drinking water. The exceptions are the acidic pH and turbidity values in surface water and unimproved water sampled from all the watersheds (Table  | Water Quality in Yangambi for the Main Domestic Water Supplies in the Different Watersheds: Most of the analyzed physical and chemical parameters of water from springs, rivers and cisterns in Yangambi meet WHO standards for drinking water. The exceptions are the acidic pH and turbidity values in surface water and unimproved water sampled from all the watersheds (Table  | Relationship Between the Physicochemical Quality of Stream Water Based on Indices of Landscape Configuration and Composition in Watersheds: The linearity analysis showed no significant linear relationships between the different water physicochemical parameters, except for turbidity and temperature, which showed a strong positive correlation (r = 92%). However, there were positive, nonsignificant relationships between almost all the variables of physicochemical water parameters.    Significant p-values are followed by an asterisk * for < 0.05 and *** for < 0.001. | Relationship between the Physicochemical Quality of Stream Water Based on Indices of Landscape Configuration and Composition in Watersheds: The linearity analysis showed no significant linear relationships between the different water physicochemical parameters, except for turbidity and temperature, which showed a strong positive correlation (r = 92%). However, there were positive, nonsignificant relationships between almost all the variables of physicochemical water parameters. The exceptions were for temperature and dissolved oxygen, and also for conductivity and pH, where the linearity correlation was negative (Table 
The linear correlation test results between the different landscape indices (configuration and composition) and the different river water quality parameters revealed a significant correlation (p-value < 0.05), especially for turbidity, pH and temperature. However, almost all landscape indices were not significantly dependent (p-value > 0.05) on conductivity and dissolved oxygen, except for MPA_PF and MPA_CL, respectively. Only turbidity was negatively correlated with the proportion of DF and MPA of perturbed forests (Table 
The best SLR model, which explained the effect of each landscape parameter on different water physicochemical parameters, is that of pH as a function of ED-DF. Using this model, ED-DF explained up to 97% of the observed variability in pH (AIC, Akaike information criterion = -3.2; p-value > 0.05) (Table 
A simple forecast of precipitation and temperature for 30 years in the future (2050) was performed using the available data (Figures  | Availability, Accessibility, Use and Management Capacity of Water Resources in Yangambi: Yangambi water supply points are located mainly around the urban-rural areas and villages. Nevertheless, several springs are located inside the forest, far from the residential areas. They were not considered in this study, as the Yangambi population barely uses them for water supply. There are only three wells, dug by the NRHS in Bangala, Likango and Ekutsu, but they are not operational. Cisterns are present exclusively in Isalowe, Lusambila and Lumumba (Isalowe, Lusambila and Loweo watersheds). These cisterns and wells are less than 1 km from settlements (Figure  | Availability, Accessibility, Use and Management Capacity of Water Resources in Yangambi: Yangambi water supply points are located mainly around the urban-rural areas and villages.

Cisterns are present exclusively in Isalowe, Lusambila and Lumumba (Isalowe, Lusambila and Loweo watersheds). These cisterns and wells are less than 1 km from settlements (Figure 
Water is mainly used for domestic purposes in Yangambi, mostly for (i) toilets, (ii) bathing, (iii) dishwashing, (iv) laundry, (v) cooking and (vi) drinking. Water from streams, cisterns and rainfall is used less for drinking and cooking, and more for toilets, bathing, dishwashing and laundry. On the other hand, water from springs and streams is used for everything, with a preference for spring water for drinking. In some settlements and villages at larger distances from springs, such as Obiloto and Yanguma (in the Bonde watershed), people sometimes use water from rivers or rainwater for drinking. Most households do not pretreat their water before using it for domestic purposes. Only a few households, especially in Isalowe and Lusambila, use clean cloths as filters, or purifying products such as chlorine, or boil drinking water before its use (Table 
The percentage of illiterate household heads was moderately low in all the watersheds, where the education level is, on average, limited to secondary school. The exceptions were in Loweo (where most household heads did not go beyond primary school), and in Lusambila and Isalowe (where several household heads attained university educations) (Table 
The five watersheds have a Water Poverty Index (WPI) score varying between 50% and 66% (Figure  | Durable house: 33 83 100 17 0

Analysis of the linear correlation between different landscape parameters in the five watersheds in Yangambi showed a negative relationship between the proportion of DF and most of the landscape parameters related to bare soil and residential, CL and GL.

Analysis of the linear correlation between different landscape parameters in the five watersheds in Yangambi showed a negative relationship between the proportion of DF and most of the landscape parameters related to bare soil and residential, CL and GL. This means that as the PD of CL, ED of bare soil and residential and MPA of GL increase, the proportion of DF patches tends to decrease in the watersheds. The CL, BSR, GL and PF landscape parameters also change positively with those showing an increase in forest landscape fragmentation (ED and PD), but also a decrease in its proportion in Yangambi.
Brandt and colleagues confirmed these relationships in 2016  | Water Quality in Yangambi According to WHO Standards: Apart from turbidity and pH, the physicochemical parameter analysis of the different Yangambi water points met WHO standards for drinking water 
Comparison of the averages of the physicochemical parameters of rivers did not show any significant difference between watersheds (p-value < 0.05), except for conductivity and turbidity (p-value <0.05). The significant differences observed between the averages for turbidity and conductivity between watersheds can be explained by LULC types in Yangambi. Mwayi and Naito in 2019 found that forest massifs in Malawi could reduce sedimentation caused by watershed runoff to supply major water points  | Physicochemical Parameters of River Waters' Nexus Landscape Parameters in the Yangambi: The correlation analysis between different physicochemical parameters of rivers showed a positive relationship. The only exceptions were pH and conductivity-which were negatively correlated with each other-and temperature and dissolved oxygen (Table 
The positive correlation between turbidity and pH was not significant, but could still be linked to the ferralitic soil type predominating in Yangambi, which usually undergoes deep leaching 
Thus, as the proportion and MPA of DF increased, water at the watershed level became less turbid. A similar relationship with the proportion of DF was not significant, possibly due to other sources of variability not considered in this study. On the other hand, the increase in PD, MPA, ED, CL, bare soil and GL increased turbidity significantly.
The pH was positively influenced by almost all landscape parameters related to DF fragmentation, including ED_FD and PD_FD. These last two indices give an idea of the level of degradation of the DF cover. All landscape indices favoring other types of LULC (configuration and composition), other than those favoring DF, tend to make the pH of stream waters less acidic than those watersheds with high proportions of forests. This would explain why the Isalowe and Lusambila watersheds have less acidic pH and more turbid stream waters with high temperatures (Figure 
In a 2015 study 
In a 2015 study 
Three SLR models best explained the variability of the analyzed physicochemical parameters of river water according to landscape parameters by referring to the AIC. These models explain the variation in pH as a function of ED_PF (94%), ED_crop land (92%) and PD_DF (90%) (Table  | Water Vulnerability and Climate Change in Yangambi: As previously discussed in the results section, it appears that different water supplies are used in Yangambi. In the old settlements constructed around the houses of INERA workers, especially in Lusambila and Isalowe, the presence of cisterns and improved water springs is noticeable. In the other watersheds (Bonde, Loweo and Lubilaie), people obtain water mostly from rivers and springs, even if these sources are not improved. Indeed, the history of Yangambi city shows that water collection infrastructures (mainly cisterns), inherited from the colonial period, are exclusively located in certain watersheds within the administrative districts of the INERA Yangambi city. These settlements are much closer to urban than rural areas. A similar situation is observed almost everywhere in sub-Saharan Africa, where lack of infrastructure is a major problem for water accessibility, especially in peri-urban and rural areas 
The spatial distribution of surveyed water points using GIS shows that water sources vary in the five watersheds. Although there are several water points in Yangambi, some are in the middle of the forest (in the YRB), far away from houses (Figure 
The surveys revealed that water resource management capacity in Yangambi is generally low, except for the Isalowe watershed, which exceeds the 50% score (Figure 
Similarly, in terms of the water resource use component (amount of water consumed per person per day), the Isalowe watershed has the highest score. This advantage is probably due to the water collection infrastructure-especially the cisterns, and the high density of springs and rivers close to homes (Figure

responsible for drought and flooding in the region. The availability and accessibility of water in this region is often compromised when irregularities and seasonality are not considered. In turn, the global climate predictions in the fifth report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the Commission Internationale du Bassin Congo-Oubangui-Sangha  | Conclusions and Recommendations: This study aimed to analyze the vulnerability of domestic water resources in the Yangambi context. We based the assessment of the impact of LULC types on the physicochemical quality parameters of stream water and whether the population would be able to adapt to this vulnerability in the context of climate change. The physicochemical parameters of stream water within the watersheds showed that water for domestic use no longer meets WHO standards for drinking water. This situation is amplified by the conversion of DF cover to other types of land use (linked to anthropization). These practices, in turn, deteriorate physicochemical parameters such as turbidity, pH and temperature of stream water. Unfortunately, the population in Yangambi has a low capacity to manage this resource, which results in high vulnerability for climate change adaptation. This vulnerability is already apparent through climate parameters recorded at the INERA Yangambi meteorological station based in this area. Therefore, we recommend an analysis of the state of the water resource by watershed to determine the best options for water resource management in Yangambi. At the same time, an exhaustive hydrological data sampling is needed to understand the different types of LULC contributions to the variability of water resource quality in Yangambi. The installation of gauging stations at different rivers in Yangambi will be important for better monitoring of the water resource. Finally, the installation of infrastructures that can help supply water to the communities while preserving the DF within the YBR is a priority, as water quality and quantity highly depend on it. A qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the impact of LULC change on water resources' quality and availability would be interesting. It could consider detailed analyses of physicochemical (organic ions, major inorganic ions, trace elements, etc.) and biological parameters of water, as well as the variation of streamflow data within the YBR catchments.","Scale dependence of landscape metrics and their indicatory value for nutrient and organic matter losses from catchments (, , , 2005) || Spatial variability of water use efficiency in China's terrestrial ecosystems (, , , , , , , , , , 2015) ||  (, 2010. 2010) || Ressources en Eau et Biens et Services Li√©s √† L'√©cosyst√®me Forestier; Les for√™ts du bassin du Congo-Etats des for√™ts (, , , , , , , , , , 2008. 2008. 15 December 2020) ||  (, , , , 2015) || Water Issues in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: Challenges and Opportunities (, 2011) || State and evolution of the African rainforests between (, , , , , , , , , , 1990. 2010. 2013. 20120300) || Water supply and sanitation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (, , 2009) || Issues in Managing Water Challenges and Policy Instruments: Regional Perspectives and Case Studies (, 2015) || Les Paradoxes D'une Ressource Tr√®s Convoit√©e (, , 2011. 15 December 2020) || Land conservation and watershed management for source protection (, , 2004) || Living under a fluctuating climate and a drying Congo basin (, , , , ) ||  (, , , , 2017. 17 December 2020) || Analyse prospective de la d√©forestation estim√©e par t√©l√©d√©tection dans la r√©serve de biosph√®re de Yangambi (, , , , 2016) || Congo Basin forest loss dominated by increasing smallholder clearing (, , , , , , , , 2018, 4, eaat2993) || Developing a framework to measure watershed sustainability by using hydrological/water quality model (, , 2011) ||  (, , 2004, 1, 4711. 15 December 2020) || Managing forests for cleaner water for urban populations (, , 2007) || Am√©liorer l'acc√®s √† l'eau et √† l'√©l√©ctricit√©-Diagnostic des Potentialit√©s Solaires et Options Hydrauliques Dans le Paysage de Yangambi (, 2015) || Calculating a water poverty index (, 2002) || Application of water poverty index (WPI) in Nepalese context: A case study of Kali Gandaki River Basin (KGRB) (, , , 2012) || Courbes intensit√©-dur√©e-fr√©quence des pr√©cipitations √† Yangambi, Congo, au moyen de diff√©rents mod√®les de type (, , 2006) || Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater (, 2012) || Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality: Fourth Edition Incorporating the First Addendum; World Health Organization (, 2017) || Deforestation and timber production in Congo after implementation of sustainable management policy: A response to (, , , 2017. 2018) || Etude de la Qualite de L'eau Destinee a la Consommation Humaine Dans le Sous-Bassin Versant de Ravine Diable (Anse-A-Veau) (, 2017. 15 December 2020) || Effect of deforestation on access to clean drinking water (, , 2019) || Relating landscape characteristics to non-point source pollution in mine waste-located watersheds using geospatial techniques (, , 2007) || Effects of land cover, topography, and built structure on seasonal water quality at multiple spatial scales (, , 2012, 209-210) || Soil Atlas of Africa (, , , , , , , , , , 2013) || Caract√©ristiques p√©dologiques compar√©es de termiti√®res sous for√™ts primaires du plateau de Yangambi en cuvette centrale congolaise (, 2002) ||  (, 2016) || Improved method to calculate a water poverty index at local scale (, , 2010) || Water poverty index: An apparatus for integrated water management in Nigeria (, 2014) || Mesures de la pauvret√© en eau: Analyse comparative et d√©veloppement de l'indice de pauvret√© en eau (, 2013) || Changes in temperature and precipitation extremes in western central Africa, Guinea Conakry, and Zimbabwe, 1955-2006 (, , , , , , , , , , 2009) || Water poverty in Africa: A review and synthesis of issues, potentials, and policy implications (, 2018)"
"Analysis of carbon emissions from land cover change during 2000 to 2020 in Shandong Province, China",Linye Zhu; Huaqiao Xing; Dongyang Hou,"Land cover change affects the carbon emissions of ecosystems in some way. The qualitative and quantitative understanding of carbon emissions from human activities (e.g., land cover change, industrial production, etc.) is highly significant for realizing the objective of carbon neutrality. Therefore, this paper used GlobeLand30 land cover maps, annual average normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, annual average net ecosystem productivity (NEP) data and statistical yearbook data from 2000 to 2020 to explore the relationship between land cover change and carbon emissions. Specifically, it included land cover change, carbon storage changes influenced by land cover change, spatial and temporal analysis of carbon sources and sinks, land use intensity change and anthropogenic carbon emissions. The results of the study show that the main land cover changes in Shandong province during 2000-2020 was cultivated land conversion to artificial surfaces. Among them, the area of cultivated land converted to artificial surfaces from 2000 to 2010 was 4930.62 km 2 , and the proportion of cultivated land converted to artificial surfaces from 2010 to 2020 was as high as 78.35%. The total carbon stock of vegetation affected by land cover change decreased by 463.96 √ó 10 4 t and 193.50 √ó 10 4 t in 2000-2010 and 2010-2020 respectively. The spatial and temporal distribution of carbon sources and sinks differed more markedly from 2000 to 2020, and land use intensity changes in Shandong Province showed an upward trend. Of the total energy production, industry has the largest energy consumption, followed closely by total energy consumption in transportation, storage and postal services.
Phenomena such as global warming, melting glaciers, rising sea levels and hazy weather indicate that climate change brought about by the greenhouse effect is seriously affecting the future survival of mankind 1-3 . The Earth's climate is witnessing changes due to the influence of various factors. In recent years, global warming has become a hot issue for research. Emissions of greenhouse gases, e.g., carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, are regarded as a major contributor to global warming 4-6 . Studies have shown that the global average surface temperature has increased by 0.74 ¬∞C since the last century 7 , and atmospheric CO 2 concentrations have increased by up to 1.9 ppm per year 8 . The Global Carbon Budget Project shows that emissions of fossil CO 2 will increase by 0.5% in 2019, with emissions falling in the US and EU28 and increasing in China, India and the rest of the world 9 . With increasing levels of urbanisation and industrialisation, human activities are emitting large amounts of CO 2 into the atmosphere. Of these, land cover change is an important contributor to carbon emissions, making up roughly one-third of the carbon emissions generated by human activities from the industrial revolution 10 , contributing to increasing concentrations of CO 2 . Therefore, the study of the interrelationship between land cover change and carbon emissions is of great importance to further reduce carbon emissions.
The implementation of the reform and opening-up policy has led to a significant acceleration of urbanisation in China, most notably the dramatic expansion of artificial surfaces. Land cover change, energy consumption and other related human activities are the sources of carbon emissions and account for a relatively large share. Rapid economic development and high urbanisation levels in China's cities are hotspots for studying carbon emissions caused by land cover change. For example, Deng et al. analysed the influence of expanding construction land on carbon emissions related to energy in China and its provinces from 2001 to 2011 11 . Lu et al. explored the development process and characteristics of regional differences in carbon emissions from agricultural land in 31","Untitled Section: provinces in mainland China from 2000 to 2015 
On 15 September 2020, the 30 m Global Land Cover 2020 remote sensing mapping data was released. The GlobeLand30 data consists of 10 primary types, e.g., cultivated land, forest, grassland, shrub land, wetland, water bodies, artificial surfaces, bare land, etc 
According to the China Emission Accounts and Datasets (CEADs), Shandong Province ranks among the top five provinces in China in terms of total carbon emissions, and is a province with both high total carbon and high carbon intensity 
Therefore, this paper takes Shandong Province as the research object and focuses on four aspects, i.e., land cover change, land cover-influenced carbon storage change, spatial-temporal distribution of carbon sources and sinks, land use intensity change and anthropogenic carbon emissions. Firstly, the amount, rate of change and transfer matrix were explored for land cover using GlobeLand30 maps for 2000, 2010 and 2020. Secondly, carbon stock changes affected by land cover change were analysed according to land cover type. Then, annual average normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) data calculated using remote sensing images and annual average net ecosystem productivity (NEP) data were used for spatial and temporal analysis of carbon sources and sinks. Finally, land use intensity change and anthropogenic carbon emissions were explored with statistical yearbook data, and the above changes were analysed for attribution and recommendations were made accordingly.
The purpose of this paper is to analyse the interactions between land cover change and carbon emissions in Shandong Province from multiple perspectives, and to use the latest land cover data to explore land cover change and carbon emissions in a rational and effective way. The contributions of this paper are as follows. (1) This study provides a comprehensive analysis of land cover change, land use intensity change, and the spatial and temporal distribution of carbon sources and sinks in Shandong Province. (2) This study explores the changes in vegetation carbon storage due to land cover change and anthropogenic carbon emissions in Shandong Province. (3) This study provides an attribution analysis of the above-mentioned land cover changes and carbon emissions and proposes corresponding solutions. This study is crucial for the development of low carbon land management policies. | Materials and methods: Figure  | Study area.: Shandong Province is located in the eastern coastal region of China (34¬∞ 22.9‚Ä≤-38¬∞ 24.01‚Ä≤ N, 114¬∞ 47.5‚Ä≤-122¬∞ 42.3‚Ä≤ E)  | Data.: The data used in this study were land cover maps, NDVI data and socio-economic data.

Figure  | Land use intensity change and carbon emissions.:  | Discussion: Attribution analysis of land cover change and carbon emission change. The conversion of cultivated land to artificial surfaces and the conversion of forest to cultivated land and grassland in Shandong Province the main reasons for the reduction of carbon storage. This is a very common phenomenon for the current urbanisation process in China. Economic growth and population increase are the main factors leading to the change of artificial surfaces 
The conversion of water bodies and cultivated land is mainly concentrated in Jining City, which is also the region where changes in vegetation carbon storage are more pronounced. Jining City covers Weishan Lake, the largest freshwater lake in northern China, and the construction of water storage facilities such as dams and river embankments, as well as river ditches on agricultural land and aquaculture ponds, has led to large changes in the area of water bodies in Jining City 
The change in water bodies and wetland conversion is mainly distributed in Dongying City. Dongying City is located at the mouth of the Yellow River and has a low, flat topography that makes drainage difficult and is influenced by the amount of water in the Yellow River, making it easy to form wetlands 
The spatial and temporal distribution of carbon sources and sinks in Shandong province differs greatly between 2000 and 2019. According to land use intensity change and carbon emissions, it can be observed that population increase and economic development have led to a rapid rise in total energy consumption and a marked growth in land use intensity change, which in turn generates large amounts of carbon emissions, especially from industrial production land. | Recommendations related to land planning and carbon emissions.: With the above analysis, it is necessary to reduce carbon emissions scientifically and effectively and to increase the carbon storage capacity of vegetation. Increasing the vegetation cover of artificial surfaces is an effective way to offset carbon losses, with forest having the highest vegetation carbon density. Planting high biomass vegetation on artificial surfaces can be a valuable method to increase carbon storage.
Furthermore, the conservation of land types such as wetland, grassland and forest is also an useful channel to increase the amount of carbon stored in vegetation. Combined with relevant conservation policies, the establishment of wetland nature conservation parks and forest conservation parks, and the improvement of relevant legal systems for environmental protection, such as the Regulations on the Return of Cultivated land to Forests 
On this basis, carbon emissions should be reduced artificially in all aspects of life, from daily life to industrial production. In industrial production, try to use clean energy and renewable energy to gradually replace fossil energy  | Conclusions: This paper analysed the land cover changes in Shandong Province from 2000 to 2020 using the GlobeLand30 land cover maps. The spatial and temporal distribution of carbon stocks influenced by land cover changes was obtained according to the changes in land cover types. Carbon sources and sinks were studied in conjunction with annual average NDVI data and annual average NEP data. Land use intensity changes and anthropogenic carbon emissions were assessed based on statistical yearbook data. The specific conclusions are as follows.
(1) The main change in land cover in Shandong province during the period 2000-2020 was the conversion from cultivated land to artificial surfaces. From 2000 to 2010, a total of 7748.14 km 2 of cultivated land was transferred, with 4930.62 km 2 being converted to artificial surfaces. Between 2010 and 2020, the proportion of cultivated land converted to artificial surfaces was as high as 78.35%. energy consumption in industry was the largest in terms of total energy production, closely followed by total energy consumption in transportation, storage and postal services. Most other sectors showed a more pronounced upward trend in energy consumption. (5) The conversion of cultivated to artificial surfaces and forest to cultivated and grassland in Shandong Province, influenced by population growth and the expansion of construction land, are the main reasons for the decrease in vegetation carbon storage. Jining City is an area where the conversion of water bodies and cultivated land is more apparent, related to the construction of water storage facilities, river ditches and aquaculture ponds, and also linked to the results of remote sensing image interpretation. The conversion of water bodies and wetland in Dongying City is related to policy factors.
This study provides theoretical support and basic data for various land management policies of local governments from a more holistic perspective. In order to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality, we should slow down the expansion of artificial surfaces and increase land with higher biomass (e.g., forest), which in turn improves the vegetation carbon storage capacity of the land. Relevant government departments should promulgate and implement relevant policies on energy conservation and emission reduction, optimise the land use structure and consider reducing carbon emissions while ensuring economic development.","Diurnal and seasonal variability of CO 2 and CH 4 concentration in a semi-urban environment of western India (, 2021) || Novel and disappearing climates in the global surface ocean from 1800 to 2100 (, , , 2021) || Southeast Amazonia is no longer a carbon sink (, 2021) || Impact of carbon emissions in a sustainable supply chain management for a second generation biofuel (, , 2018) || A sustainable production-inventory model for a controllable carbon emissions rate under shortages (, , , 2020) || The nexus between carbon emissions, poverty, economic growth, and logistics operations-empirical evidence from southeast Asian countries (, , 2019) || Carbon emissions induced by land-use and land-cover change from 1970 to (, 2010. 2019) || Quantification of the soil organic carbon balance in the Tai-Lake paddy soils of China (, 2016) || Carbon dioxide emissions continue to grow amidst slowly emerging climate policies (, 2020) || Carbon emissions from land use and land-cover change (, 2012) || Effect of construction land expansion on energy-related carbon emissions: Empirical analysis of China and its Provinces from 2001 to 2011 (, , , 2015) || Dynamic evolution of regional discrepancies in carbon emissions from agricultural land utilization: Evidence from Chinese provincial data (, , , , , 2018) || Decoupling analysis of carbon emission from construction land in Shanghai (, , , , 2019) || Spatiotemporal variations of urban CO 2 emissions in China: A multiscale perspective (, , , , 2018) || Spatial-temporal characteristics of carbon emissions from land use change in Yellow River Delta region (, 2022) || Analysis and applications of GlobeLand30: A review (, , , , 2017) || The first comprehensive accuracy assessment of globel and 30 at a national level: Methodology and results (, , , , , 2015) || GlobeLand30 maps show four times larger gross than net land change from 2000 to 2010 in Asia (, , , , 2019) || Global cropland intensification surpassed expansion between 2000 and 2010: A spatio-temporal analysis based on GlobeLand30 (, 2020) || How well has economic strategy changed CO 2 emissions?

Comprehensive review on land use/land cover change classification in remote sensing,M Navin; L Agilandeeswari,"Research in the field of remote sensing of the environment is valuable and informative. Hyperspectral (HSP) and multispectral (MSP) satellite images have been used for different remote sensing applications. Land Use/Land Cover (LU/LC) change classification has been considered as important research in the field of remote sensing environment. This review aims to identify the various LU/LC applications, remote sensing satellites, geospatial software, pre-processing techniques, LU/LC classification, clustering, spectral unmixing, landscape change models and evaluation metrics. The main objective of this review is to present the more frequently used techniques for analysing LU/LC change with MSP and HSP satellite images. An aim of this review is to motivate future researchers to work efficiently with MSP and HSP satellite images in the field of remote sensing.","Introduction: Analysing multispectral (MSP) and hyperspectral (HSP) satellite images in the field of remote sensing and the geographic information system (GIS) environment have become some of the hottest topics among researchers around the world. Everyday changes on the Earth's surface have a significant impact on society, and this has been the driver for researchers to work on the land use/land cover (LU/LC) change problem. The information gathered from various satellites has been used by researchers to map the Earth's features and infrastructures. Land use and land cover are two different terms to describe the Earth's surface. The land cover area represents the forest-covered areas, wetlands, grasslands, water-covered areas, mountainous regions and deserts etc. Specific events and changes that take place in land cover represent changes in land use categories, such as urbanisation, shopping centres, reservoirs and parks etc.  | LU/LC applications and study area selection: The modification of the Earth's surface or natural environment results in LU/LC change. We can see LU/LC change happening during the loss or development of forests, agricultural land, bodies of water and urban areas. Causes of LU/LC change are shown in Figure 
The initial process in LU/LC change research is selecting the study area. Many researchers around the world have carried out LU/LC change analysis research over many years. Some of the study areas for LU/LC analysis have been North-eastern Latvia,  | Data acquisition:  | Geospatial software: MSP and HSP satellite images are analysed and processed through different geospatial software tools. Some of these tools are described in    | Pre-processing techniques: Pre-processing is an essential technique used to improve the quality of raw satellite data. The satellite data can be calibrated by using the process of atmospheric, radiometric, geometric and topographic corrections. The uses and limitations of these methods are shown in Table  | LU/LC classification and clustering: Every pixel in a pre-processed satellite image is a unique entity and it has to be labelled to obtain the LU/LC classification maps using different classification techniques.
Researchers have proposed and worked with many algorithms for extracting LU/LC data from satellite data. Classification or supervised learning works with known information about the data and is used in classifying LU/LC classes. Clustering is used for unsupervised learning, since there is no prior information about the labelled data. A few LU/LC classifications, supervised and clustering unsupervised methods are explained and shown in Table  | Spectral unmixing: Spectral unmixing helps to identify pixels that contain more than one LU/LC type. The measured range of a mixed pixel is decomposed into a group of endmembers and their corresponding abundances, which specify the amount of each endmember within the pixel. Spectral unmixing methods are mostly used when processing HSP satellite images. The few spectral unmixing methods are explained and shown in Table  | Landscape change models: Landscape change models are used for forecasting past, current and future LU/LC changes. LU/LC change analysis results will assist urban planners in taking the necessary action to protect the LU/LC environment. Table 
Researchers have used the information from satellite images to determine land cover. They used the spectral bands directly to identify the level of vegetation over the area and validated the LU/LC classified map with reference data. Distance metrics were used to identify the LU/LC class in satellite images through the evaluation of the spectral distance between the pixels. Researchers have also calculated the amount of LU/LC changes experienced between certain time periods. | Spectral distance metrics: By evaluating the spectral distance between the pixels in satellite images, LU/LC classes were assessed and this also helps to model spatial variables like slope, elevation, aspect, distance from the road, forest edge, farmland and water bodies etc. The frequently used distance metrics described in the following section are: Euclidean Distance, Mahalanobis Distance, Manhattan Distance, Canberra Distance, Jeffries-Matusita and SAM. | Euclidean Distance: Remote sensing researchers frequently use Euclidean Distance d(x,y) to measure the distance between spectral signatures of satellite image pixels in n-dimensional spectral space.

Edges are flattened and some limits of the data pixel values will be lost.
Topographic Correction 
Spatial misregistration can occur.  | Methods Purpose Limitations: Classification methods | Maximum Likelihood: Classification 
Increase in computation time when the number of bands of the satellite image increases.
k-Nearest Neighbour Classification (kNN) 
With high dimensional data, the kNN algorithm performs a slower calculation of distance in each dimension.

The spectral features of vegetation help to gain information about the growth of plants and green areas throughout the world. The spatial resolution of each satellite spectrum differs, and Table 
We have explained the most commonly used vegetation indices for measuring the level of vegetation and the water content in the specific land cover region: EVI, NDVI and Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI). The optimised vegetation index or EVI is useful in computing the global vegetation greenness. It corrects the canopy background noise of the data and displays areas with more dense vegetation. 2 ( ) ( )

The low spatial resolution of the satellite image can lead to the most challenging problem of mixed pixels. | Mixture Tuned Matched: Filtering (MTMF) Method 
The flexibility of the method can also be a drawback since, due to spectral variability, false detection may occur in mixed pixels of the satellite image. | Monte Carlo Spectral: Mixture Analysis (MCSMA) 
Computational time is high and there is a risk of false precision.  The high and low possibilities of vegetation are identified by using NDVI values.

LU/LC change has been explained for various application areas such as deforestation, urban expansion, agriculture/crop damage, vegetation loss and wetland change. This review provides detailed information about the characteristics of satellite data, geospatial software, pre-processing techniques, classification, clustering and spectral unmixing methods, landscape change models and the performance metrics for evaluating the satellite images. Amongst geospatial software, Matlab, Python and Rstudio have the advantage in developing new algorithms for analysing LU/LC changes using HSP and MSP satellite images. Pre-processing should be performed to correct the geometric, radiometric, topographic and atmospheric effects present in satellite images. Classification, clustering and spectral unmixing methods are used to extract the spectral features from satellite images. Effective landscape models were used to analyse the LU/LC change for specific time intervals in a particular region. The importance of performance metrics has been discussed in this review. It should help future researchers to work on the LU/LC change analysis process in the field of remote sensing. Developing a new optimised algorithm for LU/ LC classification and for analysing LU/LC change remains a challenge for future researchers. Information about LU/LC change will help to assist Government officials responsible for land resource planning to take adequate measures to protect the LU/LC environment.","Using satellite data to

"Analysis and prediction of land cover changes using the land change modeler (LCM) in a semiarid river basin, Iran",Sajad Khoshnood Motlagh; | Sadoddin; | Amin Haghnegahdar; Saman Razavi; | Salmanmahiny; | Khalil Ghorbani; Amir Sadoddin,"Predicting future land cover (LC) changes is an important step in the proper planning and management of watersheds. As a susceptible area to salinity and desertification, receiving only about 195 mm rainfall annually, the Hable-Rud River basin is especially sensitive to land use/cover changes. Based on corrected LANDSAT satellite images for the years 1986, 2000, and 2017, the LC were extracted using the maximum likelihood (ML) method. LC changes were predicted by applying the land change modeler (LCM) for the basin. The kappa index for classification in 1986, 2000, and 2017 was 75, 78, and 81%, respectively. Using LCM, the prediction was accomplished for the year 2017 with a kappa index of above 74%. The LC map was predicted for year 2040. The analysis indicates that over the past 32 years, bare land, saline land, agricultural, industrial, and residential areas have increased by about 8, 6.2, 2.7, 0.63, and 0.48%, respectively; while rangeland area was decreased by 18%. Results also indicate that given the predicted LC for year 2040 in comparison with the reference year (2017), saline land, agricultural, industrial, and residential areas will be likely to continue to increase by about 3, 1.5, 0.7, and 0.8%, respectively, whereas bare land and rangeland will most likely decrease by about 4.55 and 1.45%, respectively. The findings of this study assist in analyzing the future trends of LC changes in the basin. This information can be used as a guide for land planners and managers in future land use planning of the area.","| INTRODUCTION: The dynamic and sometimes substantial transformation in land use/land cover (LULC) occurs due to socio-economic and natural changes. Although reasons for land cover changes vary depending on the nature and extent of the area, the main drivers can be identified as deforestation, rangeland degradation, and expansion of agriculture 
Analysis and prediction of LULC changes allows us to assess ecosystem changes and their environmental consequences at various temporal and spatial scales (Di 
Over the past few decades, the application of remote sensing technology and geographical information systems (GIS) has gained momentum in landscape dynamics assessment in regional as well as global scales 
These studies have shown that CA models are efficient in producing practical simulations of land cover patterns and other spatial structures. CA algorithm is an extension of the land change modeller (LCM) to help predict LC changes using the descriptive variables such as elevation, slope, aspect, and distance from specific areas 
Land cover changes in arid and semiarid regions can lead to the rapid expansion of desert areas. The Hable-Rud River basin (HRB) has recently encountered desertification problems in its' south. It receives very low precipitation in some parts of the basin (95 mm), and has a large area of saline lands (1,800 km 2 ) in the southern parts of the basin due to the presence of evaporative sediments. Thus, the changes in land cover in this region can affect both the quantity and quality of water, as well as wind and water erosion severity in the HRB. Therefore, HRB requires assessment of LC changes for better management, planning, and policy-making. Thus, the main objective of this study was to quantify LC changes over the last 32 years  and predict them for the year 2040 using LANDSAT enhanced thematic mapper (ETM) and LANDSAT thematic mapper (TM) images.
Hence, this research attempts to answer the following questions:  | | MATERIALS AND METHODS:  | | Study area: The HRB, with an area of about 12,700 km 2 , is located between 34 26 0 54 00 to 35 57 0 31 00 N latitudes and 51 39 0 52 00 to 53 8 0 46 00 E longitudes. This basin straddles the border between the Tehran and Semnan provinces in Iran. Situated within the basin are the cities of Firouzkouh and part of Damavand in Tehran Province, and Garmsar, Sorkh, Aradan, and Eyvanekey in Semnan Province. The geographic location of HRB is shown in Figure 
Most of the northern region is mountainous, while a large part of the southern region is in the plains. Average annual precipitation and temperature in the northern part are about 400 mm and 11 C, respectively, while in the southern part these are about 125 mm and 18 C, respectively. Evapotranspiration (ET) is high and the average potential ET can reach to 1,500 mm yr √Ä1 in the basin  | | Data collection and research methods:  | | Satellite image preparation: For this study, LANDSAT satellite images (level 1) of the Paths/Rows 163/35, 163/36, 164/35, and 164/36 with a resolution of 900 m 2 were accessed through the United States Geological Survey (https:// earthexplorer.usgs.gov/). Thus, imageries from the sensors TM, ETM+, and OLI of LANDSATS 5, 7, and 8 were obtained for the years 1986, 2000, and 2017, respectively. The coordinate system used was WGS_1984_UTM_Zone_39N. To reduce the effect of seasonal and phonological changes on the detected land cover changes, the image pairs were selected in the same season or temporally close for all years studied. Land cloud cover (less than 5%) was also a key criterion in selecting images. Radiometric and atmospheric corrections were accomplished to satisfy the preprocessing requirement for change detection. The images using iteratively reweighted multivariate alteration detection (IR-MAD) and fast line-of-sight atmospheric analysis of hypercube (FLAASH) methods in ENVI software were radiometrically and atmospherically corrected, respectively. The detail of the data is shown in Table 
Difficulties when processing images included the rugged terrain with mountains in the north and downstream desert areas in the  | | Classification of images and extraction of historical LC maps: All the steps for this section were implemented in the ENVI software version 5.1. First, the study area was divided into six main classes including rangeland, bare land, saline land, agricultural land, industrial area, and residential area (see Table 
Finally, the accuracy of those trained samples is assessed by the kappa index or the percentage of the correspondence between Google Earth images and the extracted features on the LC maps.
To do this, ground control points were selected from Google Earth, and then, the kappa index was estimated between the ground control points and their corresponding points on the extracted maps. | | Land use/cover prediction by applying the land change modeler (LCM): The LCM is a tool to predict land changes for land planning  | | Analyzing historical LC changes: The changes in LC were analyzed using the extracted historical maps and in the process, classified image of the year 1986 was compared with that of 2000, and this was repeated for classified images of the year 2000 versus 2017, and 1986 versus 2017. | | Creating transition matrix maps: LC transition matrix maps were created to analyze and determine spatial trends in LC changes as well as LC gains and losses. These maps were made based on one or a group of sub-model(s) in the LCM using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network (ANN). Artificial neural networks (ANN) easily tackle nonlinearity in data and can provide a good mapping between dependent and independent variables  | | Model validation: The validation process compares the quality of the predicted map to the extracted map in 2017. There are two different approaches for validation: visual and statistical 
Where: p a ¬º 1  | | Predicting future LC map: The extent of LC change expected to occur in the future was predicted by applying the CA algorithm based on the extracted maps of LC types for the past years  | | Land cover changes impact analysis: To assess the possible impacts of the LC changes on hydrological characteristics in the HRB, some meteorological and hydrological variables were analyzed as below.
The precipitation data on a daily basis during the years 1986-2017 from 12 meteorological stations were extracted and analyzed from the Iran Meteorological Organization database. Three meteorological stations from the Meteorological Organization and Iran Ministry of Energy were referred to extract the temperature data. Also, the streamflow and sediment load data for the Bonkouh hydrometric station were extracted and analyzed for the same period from the Iran Ministry of Energy database.
The observed data are on a daily and monthly basis for the streamflow and sediment load, respectively. A regression equation between the discharges of streamflow and sediment load was established to estimate sediment load on a monthly basis  | | RESULTS:  | | LC extraction for the past: The area and percent of LC differences for 1986, 2000, and 2017 are shown in Figure  | | LC conversion: We used three different transition matrices for the periods: 1986-  | | Transition area matrices: The descriptive variables showed in Table 
The state transition probability matrices were created from the LC maps for the years 1986 and 2017. Then, the LC map predicted for 2017 and compared to the extracted map of the year 2017. The overall kappa index was close to 74% indicating a moderate agreement  | | Land cover changes impacts: To show further consequences of LC changes, the long term observed data of precipitation, temperature, streamflow, and sediment load was analyzed in the basin. As mentioned in Section 2.6, based on the data observed at the gauging stations, the required analysis was conducted. Trend analysis of precipitation, temperature, streamflow, and sediment load show that both the observed precipitation and streamflow have negative trends, while the trend of sediment load and temperature show a slight increase during the period (1986-2017) (Figure 
As shown in Figure 
There are many reasons for this conversion. Firstly, the arid study area has faced several years of drought from 1986 to 2017. Secondly, during this period, rangeland was widely available for conversion to other LC classes. Thus, given the question ""What are the major LC changes in the HRB?"" it can be concluded that rangeland has been the major LC type that undergone the changes. Development of agriculture (both rainfed and irrigated) started at least two decades ago when the Iranian Government implemented a new strategy for agricultural products 
LC plays a significant role in the sustainability of water resources and can have direct and indirect influences inside as well as beyond basin boundaries 
Given the question ""What are the environmental consequences of the LC changes in the HRB?"" the extracted and predicted LC maps showed a large expansion of saline lands in the basin. Also, trend analysis of sediment load data provides more specific evidence regarding the sensitivity of sediment load to LC changes. This is why sediment load values positively changed although both precipitation and streamflow had a decreasing trend.
This investigation provides an entry point for LC change as part of the discussion on more sustainable and adaptive water management in the basin. Consequently, the outcomes presented in the study should interpreted as an approach to discuss and create awareness of the consequences of LC change. To conclude, it is vital to formulate and implement some policies and strategies in the basin to prevent or minimize further land cover changes and land degradation. To this end, some relevant tools such as rewarding regulation and legislation, setting penalties, and more importantly education and outreach on the negative impacts of LC changes should be employed by the authorities in the basin. This becomes even more important with the impact of climate change. | | CONCLUSIONS: of Lake Tana basin, Northwestern Ethiopia.

"Evaluating land use/cover change associations with urban surface temperature via machine learning and spatial modeling: Past trends and future simulations in Dera Ghazi Khan, Pakistan",Muhammad Mehmood; Adnanul Rehman; Muhammad Sajjad; Jinxi Song; Zeeshan Zafar; Zhai Shiyan; Qin Yaochen; Alban Kuriqi; Xing Gao,"While urbanization puts lots of pressure on green areas, the transition of green-to-grey surfaces under land use land cover change is directly related to increased land surface temperature-compromising livability and comfort in cities due to the heat island effect. In this context, we evaluate historical and future associations between land use land cover changes and land surface temperature in Dera Ghazi Khan-one of the top cities in Pakistan-using multi-temporal Landsat data over two decades . After assessing current land use changes and future predictions, their impact on land surface temperature and urban heat island effect is measured using machine learning via Multi-Layer Perceptron-Markov Chain, Artificial Neural Network and Cellular Automata. Significant changes in land use land cover were observed in the last two decades. The built-up area expanded greatly (874 ha) while agriculture land (-687 ha) and barren land (-253 ha) show decreasing trend. The water bodies were found the lowest changes (57 ha) and vegetation cover got the largest proportion in all the years. This green-grey conversion in the last two decades (8.7%) and prospect along the main corridors show the gravity of unplanned urban growth at the cost of vegetation and agricultural land (-6.8%). The land surface temperature and urban heat island effect shows a strong positive correlation between urbanization and vegetation removal. The simulation results presented in this study confirm that by 2032, the city will face a 5¬∞ C high mean temperature based on historical patterns, which could potentially lead to more challenges associated with urban heat island if no appropriate measures are taken. It is expected that due to land cover changes by 2032, ~60% of urban and peri-urban areas will experience very hot to hot temperatures (> 31.5¬∞C). Our results provide baseline information to urban managers and planners to understand the increasing trends of land surface temperature in response to land cover changes. The study is important for urban resource management, sustainable development policies, and actions to mitigate the heat island effect. It will further asset the broader audience to understand the","Introduction: Land use (LU)/land cover (LC) refers to the classification of landscape according to the natural elements and anthropogenic activities. Collectively, the terms are often used as LULC due to their interrelationship 
Cities are considered the locomotive of development. Development practices across the world have accelerated urbanization 
The high LST concentration is primarily influenced by both horizontal and vertical expansion 
To measure variations in LULC and LST in cities, geo-information technologies such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) are flourishing 
Although some previous studies have focused on the historical changes and future LULC scenarios in Pakistan and worldwide  | Siddique: (2) model LST and its association with spatial indices as NDVI and NDBI; (3) simulate future changes in LULC and LST for 2032; and (4) explore the impact of different LULC changes on LST and formation of UHI effect. | Study area: The study area is situated in the southwestern district in Punjab province at the foothill of the Koh-e-Suleiman mountain range (Suleiman Range) 
The study area received a large population from the surrounding less developed areas in the past two decades mainly due to better quality of life, health care, education, and security reasons. Also, an influx of migrants from rural areas after the destructive flood event in 2010 brought significant changes in the existing LULC pattern  | Methodology:  | Data Collection and Pre-processing: For this research, the study period is considered as the years 2002, 2012, and 2022. In these two decades, three Multi-spectral Landsat Satellite data (for the years mentioned) are downloaded from the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) Earth Explorer archives to evaluate LULC changes and their association with LST. The Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) data are used for 2002 and 2012, and the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data are used for 2022. All the data are retrieved for March to prevent any influences of seasonal variations. Cloud coverage is set to a minimum scale of <10% for all Landsat images. However, it is notable that the cloud cover is nearly 0 % for all the used images of the study area. Additional details (metadata) regarding the images were retrieved from the USGS repository. Detailed information about the images is provided in Table  | Classification of LULC and change detection: The Image Classification tool in ArcGIS 10.5 is used to classify the LULC map due to its straightforward processing approach and simpleto-use nature with higher accuracy in terms of LULC classification. Following other research in this field, we use the supervised classification based on the maximum likelihood technique-one of the most applied techniques for LULC classification. Under the supervised classification, the images are classified using spectral signatures that are provided through training samples. Landsat-5 TM imaging bands 1-5 and band-7 are utilized to classify different land use classes. It is noted that band 6 is rejected since it represents a thermal band. In the case of Landsat-8 OLI imagery, bands 1-7 are employed. To create the LULC maps, all bands are initially stacked in ArcGIS 10.5 software using the Image Analyst Tool. To attain the accurate LULC classification, Landsat surface reflectance-derived spectral indices, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) were utilized  | Accuracy assessment of classified maps: The confusion matrix, also known as the error matrix, is used to measure the accuracy of the classified maps. The pixel's actual and expected identity information is explained in this matrix as suggested by  | Retrieval of land surface temperature: The LST is calculated by employing the thermal bands of radiometrically and geometrically corrected earth observation data from Landsat satellite during 2002-2022 for the periods 2002, 2012, and 2022. Thermal data are retrieved from the Landsat sensors and stored as Digital Numbers (DN). Later, these DNs are transformed into LST using a four-step procedure described by 
Step 1 involves the conversion of DNs values to radiance utilizing the following Equation (1):
(1)
where. L Œª represents spectral radiance for both Landsat 5 TM and 8 OLI images;
LMIN for Landsat 5 TM is 1.238 and 0.10033 for both thermal bands (Bands 10 and 11) of Landsat 8 OLI image.
LMAX represents the Landsat 5 TM as 15.30 and 22.00180 for both thermal bands (Bands 10 and 11) of the Landsat 8 OLI image.
Step 2 follows the conversion of the radiance above to satellite brightness temperature (BT) at sensors into degree Celsius as Equation 
Here, K1 and K2 reflect calibration constants given as 607.76 and 1260.56 accordingly for Landsat 5 TM. For Landsat 8, OLI images of K1 and K2 (both bands 10 and 11) are given as 
Step 3 involves the final step to calculate the LST by utilizing the following three Equations 3:
in which, LST reflects land surface temperature; TB represents satellite brightness temperature; Œª represents the wavelength of emitted radiance with a peak discharge of 11.5 Œºm; œÅ can be calculated by applying the following Equation (4), and Œµ offers the ground surface emissivity that can be calculated from proportion vegetation (PV) using Equation

The LST drives from Landsat 8, bands 10, and 11 are then averaged to obtain the cumulative LST composite image using the Cell Statistics Spatial Analyst tool extension in ArcGIS 10.5 software. | Land surface temperature classification in relation to LULC changes: To determine the relationship between LST and land cover changes over the past 20 years, if any, the LST is categorized into six different zones to better understand the temporal and spatial differences. The selection of LST threshold values to visualize clusters/zones, past literature, expert opinion, and study area characteristics were considered. We categorize the LST zones as very cold (<21.1¬∞C), cold (21.1-<23.1¬∞C), chilly (23.1-<25.1¬∞C), cool (25.1-27.1¬∞C), warmish (27.1-29.1¬∞C), hot (29.1-<31.1¬∞C), and very hot (> 31.1¬∞C)  | Land surface temperature in relation to spatial indices: Indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) have been linked to LST 
where NIR represents the Near-infrared band and R is the Red band of the satellite image. Landsat TM bands 4 and 3 are utilized to derive NDVI, while Landsat OLI bands 5 and 4 are used. The NDVI scale runs between -1 to +1, with a negative value of NDVI indicating water whereas positive NDVI indicates vegetation.
Except for NDVI, LST is significantly influenced by impervious surfaces. Hence, we also consider this parameter and represent it using the well-known NDBI. The following equation (Equation  | ND I SWIR NIR SWIR NIR: where, SWIR represents the Short-wave Infrared band and NIR is the Near-infrared band of satellite images.
Utilizing the NDBI, we can determine the built-up areas using remotely sensed data. For Landsat TM and Landsat OLI, bands 5 and 6 are utilized for SWIR, respectively. Similarly, bands 4 and 5 are utilized from Landsat TM and Landsat OLI images for NIR, respectively. Similar to NDVI, the NDBI values lie between -1 to +1, with values closer to -1 reflecting lesser built-up and values closer to +1 showing a high density of built-up areas.
The association between LST and spatial indices is initially determined using single and multiple linear regression analysis  | Simulating LULC projections for the year 2032: Given the fact that LULC is spatially dynamic, their simulation necessitates the use of spatial techniques for guaranteeing long-term sustainability and addressing current and future development needs. By combining GIS and RS methodologies, precise spatial models such as the Multi-layer Perceptron-Markov Chain (MLP-MC) have been developed to properly simulate future LULC 
The projection is made using two sorts of data: dependent variables like the previous LULC changes estimated (transitional matrix) from Landsat images of 2012, and 2022 and independent variables including elevation, slope, distance from activity centers, distance from waterways, and proximity to road networks. The distances to activity centers, waterways, and roads are estimated using the Euclidian distance function in ArcMap software. Furthermore, the ALOS-PALSAR DEM (12.5 √ó 12.5 meters spatial resolution) is employed in ArcMap software to estimate the elevation and slope of the study area. The up-scaling procedure with mean aggregation rules (resampling function in ArcGIS) was used to homogenize the spatial resolution of DEM and Landsat images. The transition potential matrix is created using the aforementioned variables. A random sampling approach is used to collect the samples of LULC. The maximum iteration (1000) and neighborhood pixel (9 cells) are selected to automatically train the prediction model  | Simulating LST projection for years 2032: Under the global warming situation, increased LST in metropolitan areas is a matter of serious concern for urban planners and decision-makers as it would impact energy demands, compromise livability in cities, and has potential health-related challenges 
In this study, LST simulation is based on the LST data from 2002 to 2022. Using QGIS software, the study area is subdivided into 500 √ó 500 meters spatial grids (fishnet) to obtain the sample points. The said grid size is set with the minimum spacing range in mind where features of one point can significantly influence LST. The LST and LULC data from previous steps are utilized for the training of a Neural Network in Terrset in order to predict LST 
The regression analysis offers information on how well the target data set describes the variance in the output results. The closer the value of R is to 1, the perfect correlation between the output and target data is expected. The Graphic User Interface (GUI) is created to test the performance indication before implementing the network. After the network's performance metrics are reasonable, they are retained for prediction. During the evaluation, the values of R and MSE are reported as 0.8 and 0.5, respectively. Thus, LST for 2032 is simulated using the call-back function. The number of hidden layers is determined by numerous experiments depending on MSE and R values. These hidden layers are significant because they influence the outcomes by allowing the network to display non-linear behavior. Three hidden layers were chosen for the current study  | Results:  | Spatial-temporal heterogeneities in LULC: Two precise patterns are observed in terms of LULC classification (Figure 
Moving forward, Supplementary Figure 
One of the important aspects of LULC classification is its reliability and accuracy. Detailed accuracy assessment is performed by picking 210 ground truth points (GTP) for all years. Multiple sources were used to seek the accuracy assessment and their detail is given in section 2.2.1.   As the urban areas increased, so did the study area's temperature in the last two decades (Figure  | LULC-wise LST discrepancies: As expected, the lowest temperature in comparison with other land use classes is recorded for water bodies over 2002-2022 and in the predicted scenario for 2032. Where 23¬∞C is the mean temperature in 2002 for water bodies, the value remained almost the same in 2012. In 2022, however, the value jumped to 33¬∞C (Figure  | Exploring connections among LST, NDBI and NDVI: NDBI is used to identify the human settlements in land cover with few other essential features like roads, dams, canals, etc. 
As for the NDVI, a completely mirrored scenario can be seen. For instance, the variation of NDVI values can be analyzed based on the radiation absorbed by the red spectral area chlorophyll and reflectance near the infrared spectral area of NDVI the more vegetation there will be. However, Figure 
The relation between LST and NDVI for the study area during the last decade shows a disproportionate relation. In 2002, the highest concentration of NDVI values was between the 25 to 30¬∞C range, with a low value of -0.2 to 0.2 (Supplementary Figure 
The relation between LST and NDBI shows the corresponding scenario of LST and NDBI. An evaluation of the linear relationship between NDBI and LST shows a positive association between both (Supplementary Figure  | Drivers of LULC and LST changes: Five driving forces are selected to predict the LST and LULC changes for the year 2032.

In an anthropogenic activities-based climate change-induced warming world, rapid urbanization-led impervious surface in cities leads to land resource degradation and scorching heat, which creates challenging conditions in terms of health issues and energy use among many others

Recently, the government developed several land-use policies and rehabilitation programs at the federal and provincial levels. Still, lack of political interest and insufficient urban governance are the main barriers to implementing these initiatives. In recent years, the government has launched a Billion Trees Tsunami program all over Pakistan to tackle green cover degradation in the country, which has important implications for urban climatic conditions 
Our results have shown that green spaces are insufficient to overcome the large urban footprint. Hence, the green cover should be introduced and preserved on large patches to overcome the impact of impervious surfaces. The city and divisional government should introduce strict policies to implement green space initiatives at a larger scale to overcome the LST effect. The predicted results of 2032 also indicated the tremendous increase of 4-5¬∞ C LST and UHI, which represents an alarming situation for urban dwellers and should be a matter of the highest concern for relevant authorities.  | Conclusions and recommendations: This study leverages multi-temporal remote sensing data to track historical and predict future patterns of land use/cover changes, LST, and the association between them in a mid-country city that is a part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) under the One Road One Built project. The overarching goal of the study is to determine how changes in land use classes affected LST. The methods used in this study are quite effective in accomplishing the research objectives. The study area is divided into four LULC categories, such as water bodies, built-up land, bare land, and vegetation. Due to political and socio-economic considerations, the land cover classification revealed that built-up areas and water bodies increased by 8.7 and 0.6%, respectively, over the study period . In contrast, bare land and vegetation dropped by 2.5 and 6.8%, respectively.
Furthermore, the study determines a negative association of vegetation area (NDVI) and water bodies with LST. The LULC significantly influences the LST and is extremely sensitive to vegetation and soil moisture; vegetation is the most important element in this connection. Although there is a positive association between NDBI and LST, higher LST is reported in areas with less vegetated (barren land) and vice versa. We conclude that without proper measures, a tremendous increase in the impervious surface is expected at the cost of green areas, which could potentially compromise the livability and comfortability of cities in the wake of global warming. This situation would very well lead to the UHI effect influencing millions of people in terms of increased energy demands and health-related challenges.
In order to cope with this increasing LST situation, green urban design and infrastructure planning and development must be prioritized. Similarly, enhancing water features like lakes, canals, waterfalls, and public fountains along with significantly increasing green areas like artificial parks, green walls, gardens, and linear plantings, particularly woody plants could positively drive the UHI mitigation efforts. In addition, to achieve the intended ecological development in terms of environmental resource planning and management, LULC alteration activities should be minimized, and environmental education should be reawakened. The findings of this study have important implications for urban landscape planning, particularly when it comes to landscape connectivity between green and impervious surfaces and their impact on LST. All of these would result in science-based information having important implications for urban planning and land resource management along with providing opportunities to design appropriate action plans to mitigate the UHI effect. | Limitations and future works: The present study provides important and useful information for the study area to design proper adaptation and mitigation policies and action plans. Such actions at local levels would progressively contribute to regional sustainability from a bottom-up perspective. From a short-to-medium-term impact perspective, predicting future changes in LULC and how it will influence the LST under environmental changes provides key references for planning and management of the land resource in a more sustainable way along with providing opportunities for adaptation and mitigating climate change through local actions. Future urban studies could concentrate on the topic of rapid urbanization's impact on public health and infrastructure along with the influence of predicted LST on health-related issues in urban societies-left for upcoming studies. Future research should address the following limitations. Higher-resolution images for LULC categorization may improve LULC composition-LST correlation explanation and urban planner usability. Urban morphology is needed to better understand the nonlinear association between LULC and LST in urban areas. For more conclusive LST prediction findings, other nonlinear regression approaches may need to be investigated. This study used temperature indices to analyze LST; multi-season analysis will provide more information. Although LULC is a primary influence in LST variation, other characteristics affecting LST, most likely topography and elevation, are equally essential. In commercial/ industrial locations, surface morphology also effects surface temperature retrieval.

Assessment of land use and land cover changes in Kenya's Mt. Elgon forest ecosystem,Nelly Nambande Masayi; | Omondi; | Tsingalia; Nelly Masayi,"Current land-use trends in Kenya's montane forest ecosystems show that land uses are changing fast due to natural and anthropogenic factors and these changes could have devastating effects on the environment. One such montane forest is the transboundary Mt. Elgon forest located in western Kenya. This study analysed trends in land use-land cover changes in Mt. Elgon forest ecosystem over the last 45 years. Landsat imageries downloaded from the United States Geological Survey archives were used to assess land use-land cover changes between 1973 and 2019 by applying supervised classification using Arc GIS 10.5. The IDRISI Selva 17.0 was used to calculate area under different land uses and generate change maps. The major Land Use-Land Cover (LULC) classified were mixed farming, natural forests, planted for-","Untitled Section: ests, bamboo forest, fallow land, tea plantation. The landsat images had an average overall classification accuracy of 87.12% and kappa coefficient (K) of 0.84. The kappa coefficient was rated as substantial and the classified images qualified for further analysis. Results established that there was an 18% decline in the natural forest cover between 1977 and 2019. There was a similar decline of 15.19% in bamboo forest cover. Plantation forests established in the 1990's also showed a 15.6% decline between 1999 and 2019. There was, however, a 29% increase in mixed farming, a 10% increase in fallow land and a 0.13% increase in tea plantations. These changes in land uses and land cover call for an urgent need to develop sustainable management plans to protect and conserve the Mt. Elgon forest ecosystem. Sustainable land management strategies to be used in the future may include education on the significance of the forest ecosystem, community participation in sustainable utilisation of forest eco-services and the introduction of sustainable alternative sources of livelihoods, such as bee farming. | K E Y W O R D S: ecosystem changes, indigenous forests, land cover, land-use changes, Mt.

The negative impacts often associated with land-use changes worldwide have become a global concern 
Dynamics of Land use and land cover (LULC) change have not been uniform in all parts of the world as a result of different driving forces 
Although land use change to modern agriculture has been effective in increasing food production, it has also extensively degraded the environment thus gaining a lot of interest because of its role in driving environmental changes  | Les images: worrying land-use changes is the conversion of forests to other uses. 
Land scarcity in the highlands of East Africa has converted forested lands to agriculture, reducing forest cover. 
(3,467,000 ha) 
Unsustainable land-use changes in this region may result in the drying up of rivers which could impact disastrously, the agricultural sector, leading to serious food insecurity challenges. Majority of people in sub-Saharan Africa depend on natural resources for their livelihoods and therefore understanding land use change (LUC) dynamics is crucial for sustainable land resource management  | | ME THODS: The Mt. Elgon forest is a transboundary ecosystem in Northwestern Kenya and Eastern Uganda. In Kenya, it is surrounded by Bungoma County to the south and Transnzoia County to the east.
On the Ugandan side, Mbale district is to the south-eastern part, Sironko district to the west and Kapchorwa district to the north.
The study was carried out in the Kenya's Mt. Elgon forest ecosystem and the adjacent regions 
Mount Elgon Ecosystem is located approximately 150 km northeast of Lake Victoria, at latitude 1¬∞ 08' N and 34¬∞45'E. The climate of the area is mainly tropically humid, with mean annual rainfall of 1400-1800 mm and an average temperature range of 14-24¬∞C, though both climate parameters vary strongly with elevation. The annual rainfall pattern is bimodally distributed, with long rains between March and June, and short rains from September to November.
Mean temperature is lowest in June to September  | | Data collection and analysis: Change analysis was run between  | | RE SULTS: Analyses revealed that in 1977, there were five major land uses which included natural forests, bamboo forests, grasslands, mixed farming and fallow land (Figure 
In 1977, natural forest was the dominant land use/ land cover in the Mt. Elgon forest ecosystem accounting for 36.08% (671.37 km 2 ) of the total land area. Grasslands were the second most dominant land use with 28.23% (525.35 km 2 ). Bamboo forest accounted for 16.60% (309.7 km 2 ) of the land use while fallow land and mixed farming accounted for 17.68% (328.9 km 2 ) and 1.37% (25.39 km 2 ), respectively.
In 1986, the region still had five major land uses which included natural forests, bamboo forests, grasslands, mixed farming and fallow land (Figure 
Grasslands covered some 29.38% (546.52 km 2 ) that were mainly used for grazing domestic animals in the forest. Fallow land and mixed farming occupied 21.4% (398 km 2 ) and 12.65% (235.42 km 2 ) of the Mt. Elgon forest ecosystem, respectively. Bamboo forests covered some 5.46% (101.79 km 2 ).
Analyses further revealed major changes in sizes of the various land use and land cover types. Between 1977 and 1986, there was Tea plantation covered some 0.10% (1.81 km 2 ) of the total land area. Previous studies further revealed that tea plantation was cultivated by the Kenyan government as a buffer around the natural forest by the Nyayo Tea Zone Corporation  | F I G U R E 2: Land Use Land Cover Changes in Mt.

The introduction of the first phase of Chepyuk settlement scheme in the region that was predominantly covered by bamboo could explain the major decline in bamboo during this period. On the contrary, the study revealed a 0.69% annual average increase in mixed farming, 0.24% annual average increase in fallow land and a 0.15% annual average increase in plantation forest.
The result imply that increase in the size of land under agriculture is the major contributor to a decline in natural forests, grasslands and bamboo forests in the Mt. Elgon forest ecosystem.
The study revealed that land use change from natural forests to mixed farming and fallow land could explain the decline in the size of natural forest of the study area. Secondary data indicated that increase in population and change in livelihoods sources from nomadic pastoralism to crop farming could explain the increase in land under mixed farming. In the 1973, the government agreed to resettle the Elgon Dorobos to an area covering 3686 ha at the lower slopes in an area currently known as Chepyuk through legal notice no 51 of 1974 
This change in the lifestyle of the people has led to encroachment of the forest for cultivation and exploitation of the forest products 
The results of this study are in agreement with the findings of

Landsat Analysis Ready Data for Global Land Cover and Land Cover Change Mapping,Peter Potapov; Matthew Hansen; Indrani Kommareddy; Anil Kommareddy; Svetlana Turubanova; Amy Pickens; Bernard Adusei; Alexandra Tyukavina; Qing Ying,"The multi-decadal Landsat data record is a unique tool for global land cover and land use change analysis. However, the large volume of the Landsat image archive and inconsistent coverage of clear-sky observations hamper land cover monitoring at large geographic extent. Here, we present a consistently processed and temporally aggregated Landsat Analysis Ready Data produced by the Global Land Analysis and Discovery team at the University of Maryland (GLAD ARD) suitable for national to global empirical land cover mapping and change detection. The GLAD ARD represent a 16-day time-series of tiled Landsat normalized surface reflectance from 1997 to present, updated annually, and designed for land cover monitoring at global to local scales. A set of tools for multi-temporal data processing and characterization using machine learning provided with GLAD ARD serves as an end-to-end solution for Landsat-based natural resource assessment and monitoring. The GLAD ARD data and tools have been implemented at the national, regional, and global extent for water, forest, and crop mapping. The GLAD ARD data and tools are available at the GLAD website for free access.","Introduction: The joint National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat program, which started in the early 1970s, provides the longest continuous global archive of the satellite earth observation data. Since the launch of 
The methods for globally consistent, multi-temporal land cover characterization and change detection were developed in the late 1990s-early 2000s using the low spatial resolution data from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 
Landsat imagery is available globally as Level 1 data (geometrically corrected data processed to sensor units) from the USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science Center (USGS EROS). The Level 2 (surface reflectance) data are available on request. The lack of Landsat Level 3 products requires users to develop and implement custom solutions for spatial and temporal data aggregation. Several initiatives are aimed to create a consistent ARD data products from the Landsat data archive, including Web-enabled Landsat Data (WELD) 
The Global Land Analysis and Discovery (GLAD) team at the University of Maryland has developed and implemented an automated Landsat data processing system that generates globally consistent analysis ready data (GLAD ARD) as inputs for land cover and land use mapping and change analysis. The data processing algorithms were developed by Hansen et al.  | The GLAD ARD Methodology:  | Landsat Image Processing:  | Image Selection: We employ the archive of Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI/TIRS data collected from the year 1997 to present available from the USGS EROS Data Center (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/). The Landsat Collection 1 Level 1 data are organized into three categories (tiers): Tier 1, Tier 2, and Real-Time 
The purpose of the ARD is to map land cover and land use during the growing season, hence images affected by seasonal snow cover are excluded from processing. The seasonal snow cover was analyzed using the MODIS/Terra Snow Cover Monthly L3 Global product (https://nsidc.org/data/MOD10CM/versions/6) and Landsat imagery. We excluded all 16-day intervals (see section 2.1.5) that feature seasonal snow cover. The snow-free window duration (Figure 
Almost 3 million images (2,984,860) from 1 January 1997, to 31 October 2019, were selected and processed to create the global ARD. The annual image count (Figure 
The Tier 1 data delivered as precision and terrain corrected products (L1TP) with image-toimage registration Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of or below 12 meters  | Conversion to Radiometric Quantity: Due to the differences in spectral band configuration between Landsat sensors, only spectral bands with matching wavelengths between TM, ETM+, and OLI/TIRS sensors are processed (Table 
Landsat Collection 1 data contain radiation measurements for reflective visible/infrared bands in the form of scaled reflectance (OLI) or radiance (TM/ETM+) recorded as integer digital numbers (DNs) 
For the TM and ETM+ data, we use the TOA conversion methods and coefficients from 
œÅ -scaled TOA reflectance; œÄ -pi constant; d -Earth-Sun distance; G -gain factor; DNoriginal digital number; B -bias factor; ESUN -mean exoatmospheric solar irradiance; sunelev -solar elevation angle. Parameters d, G, B, and ESUN are taken from 
Parameter sunelev comes from the image metadata.
The OLI data are provided as TOA reflectance without solar zenith correction. We apply Equation 2 to perform the correction for the incoming solar radiation angle. œÅ=(0.0002√óDN+0.1)/(sin(sunelev√óœÄ/180)) √ó 40,000

Parameters G, B, K1, and K2 are taken from  | Observation Quality Assessment: The per-pixel observation quality assessment is used to highlight observations with a high probability of atmospheric contamination by clouds, haze, or cloud shadows. In addition, observation quality assessment performs generic snow/ice and water mapping. Observation quality assessment is based on the aggregation of the Landsat quality assessment band and GLAD quality assessment model output.
The Landsat Collection 1 data include a Quality Assessment (QA) band based on the globally consistent CFMask cloud and cloud shadow detection algorithm 
The GLAD observation quality assessment model developed by our team represents a set of regionally adapted decision tree ensembles 
A comparison of the GLAD and CFMask cloud and cloud shadow detection results in Southeast Asia (Table 
For the Landsat 5 TM sensor, we applied an additional observation quality check to remove sensor errors. Specifically, we excluded observations which have incorrect (usually, abnormally low) radiance measurements for selected bands. We assigned a ""no data"" flag to all pixels that have DN values for visible and NIR bands below 7 (empirically derived threshold). For Landsat 5 data from the years 2001 and 2002, when most of the sensor anomalies were detected, an image was removed from ARD processing if it contained more than 10,000 of such pixels. | Reflectance Normalization: Reflectance normalization is a required step that allows extrapolation of the image characterization models in time and space by ensuring spectral similarity of the same land-cover types. Normalization addresses several factors that affect surface reflectance measurement from space, including scattering and attenuation of radiation passing through the atmosphere, and surface anisotropy. We implemented a relative normalization procedure 
(2) Pseudo-Invariant Objects
The mask of pseudo-invariant objects is derived automatically and used to calibrate the perscene surface reflectance normalization model. The mask includes clear-sky land observations (pixels) that represent the same land cover type and phenology stage in the Landsat image and MODIS normalization target composite. Water and snow/ice observations are excluded from the mask due to different properties of surface anisotropy. To select the pseudo-invariant pixels, we first exclude all observations except clear-sky land using the scene QF. Second, we calculate the absolute difference between Landsat and MODIS spectral reflectance for red and shortwave infrared bands. Only pixels with differences below 0.1 reflectance value for both spectral bands qualify for the pseudo-invariant mask. Bright objects (with red band reflectance above 0.5) are excluded from the mask. To avoid reflectance normalization artifacts due to insufficient calibration data, Landsat images with less than 10,000 pseudo-invariant pixels are discarded from the processing chain.
( | 3) Model Parametrization: To parametrize the reflectance normalization model, we calculate the bias between Landsat TOA reflectance and MODIS surface reflectance for each spectral band within the mask of pseudoinvariant objects. We collect per-band median bias for each 10 km interval of distance from the Landsat ground track. The set of median values is used to parametrize a per-band linear regression model using least squares fitting method. For each image and each spectral band, we derive gain (G) and bias (B) coefficients to predict the reflectance bias as a function of the distance from the ground track (Equation  | ŒîœÅ=G√ód+B (4): ŒîœÅ -reflectance bias; G -gain factor; d -distance from the Landsat ground track; B -bias factor.
Figure 
œÅ NORM -normalized surface reflectance; œÅ TOA -TOA reflectance; G -gain factor; d -distance from the Landsat ground track; B -bias factor. GLAD ARD normalized surface reflectance is highly correlated to the MODIS surface reflectance data used for normalization model parametrization (Figure  | Temporal Integration and Tiling: The final step of the GLAD ARD processing is a temporal aggregation of individual Landsat images into 16-day composites. The compositing interval was selected corresponding to the Landsat orbital cycle and the MODIS Level 3 data products  | GLAD ARD Structure:  | Global Tile System: The GLAD ARD tile system was developed to simplify global data handling. The geographic coordinates using the World Geodetic System (WGS84) were selected as the most universal way of sharing global data. The coordinate system is defined by EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset as EPSG:4326 (https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84/), or using PROJ standard (http://proj.org) as +proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs. The nearest neighbor resampling may be used to re-project the geographic data into the original Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Landsat pixel grid without distortion, assuming that the output UTM zone is the same as for the source Collection 1 Landsat imagery.
The spatial resolution of the ARD dataset is 0.00025 degree per pixel, which corresponds to 27.83 m per pixel on the Equator. The pixel size is a compromise between the need to preserve the original Landsat data pixel size (30 m/pixel) and to avoid using a repeating decimal number for pixel size (which may cause problems with georeference precision).
The ARD product is stored in 1 √ó 1 geographic degrees tiles. The tile format facilitates data handling and the parallelization of data processing. The exact 1 √ó 1 degree tile format, however, is not optimal for contextual analysis when neighboring pixels are located on different tiles. We implemented a partial solution to this issue by creating a tile system with a 2-pixel overlap. The actual ARD tile size is 4004 √ó 4004 pixels, an extent of 1.0005 by 1.0005 degrees. The 2-pixel buffer allows implementing contextual analyses using 3 √ó 3 and 5 √ó 5 kernels without the need to read data from multiple tiles at a time.
Tile names are derived from the tile center, and refer to the integer value of degrees. E.g., the name of a tile with center 17.5E and 52.5N is 017E_52N. The ARD product is only generated for tiles that include ice-free land area and where Landsat Tier 1 data exist (Figure  | 16-Day Composite Data: Each data granule contains observations collected during a single 16-day interval. There are 23 intervals per year (see Table 
ID -interval identification number (file name), Year -selected year (1980 and later), Interval -selected annual 16-day interval .
The 16-day data for a tile are stored as 8-band, 16-bit unsigned, LZW-compressed GeoTIFF files. The list of image bands is provided in Table  | Multi-Temporal Metrics: Despite the global radiometric consistency of the 16-day GLAD ARD product, direct application of this dataset as input to a land cover characterization model is hampered by the irregular frequency of clear-sky observation. The availability of clear-sky observations is a function of the Landsat orbital constellation, data acquisition strategy, and cloud cover. As a result, annual 16-day time-series for the same area may have dramatically different numbers of clear-sky observations between seasons and years 
The multi-temporal metrics method is a time-series data transformation that improves spatial and temporal consistency, simplifies phenological analysis, and facilitates land cover mapping and change detection at large geographic extents. The metrics approach helps to overcome the inconsistency of clear-sky data availability that is typical for sensors with low observation frequency, such as Landsat. The metrics method was developed in the mid-1980s to extract phenological features from the AVHRR-based NDVI time-series  | Annual Phenological Metrics: The annual phenological metrics serve as source data for land cover, land use, and vegetation structure mapping models. Metrics represent a set of statistics extracted from the normalized surface reflectance time-series within a corresponding calendar year (January 1 -December 31). However, limited and inconsistent data availability in regions with a short snow-free season or frequent cloud cover may preclude consistent phenology characterization by annual observation time-series. To fill long gaps in observation time-series we use the data from the three previous years. Optionally, the gap-filling algorithm can be disabled to create metrics solely from data collected during the corresponding year. The process of phenological metrics processing includes two stages: (1) selecting clear-sky observations and filling gaps in the observation time-series; and (2) extracting reflectance distribution statistics from the time-series of selected observations. First, we compile a gap-filled time-series of annual observations with the lowest atmospheric contamination (Figure 
NR AB -Normalized ratio between bands A and B; œÅ A , œÅ B -normalized surface reflectance of bands A and B.

SVVI -Spectral variability vegetation index; œÉ -standard deviation; œÅ Blue , etc. -normalized surface reflectance.
Multi-temporal metrics are generated from the time-series using two observation date ranking approaches (Figure  | Annual Change Detection Metrics: To extract statistics, we use three different approaches (Figure 
Observations in each time-series are ranked by (a) spectral band or index value, and (b) corresponding NDVI and brightness temperature values. Similar to phenological metrics, we record selected ranks and average between ranks for each spectral variable. ÔÇ∑ The time-series I is used to analyze unidirectional trend of spectral reflectance within a two-years interval. We use least squares method to fit linear regression model that predicts spectral reflectance or index value from the observation date (date range is from 1 to 46) for clear-sky observations. We record the slope of linear regression as a metric value. In addition, we calculate and record standard deviation of spectral variable within the time-series I. ÔÇ∑ The time-series D consists of per-16-day interval spectral reflectance or index differences. We rank difference values, and extract a set of statistics (selected ranks and averages) from these ranking.  The high variability of metrics allows using the generic change detection metric set for the wide spectrum of land cover monitoring applications. Annual metrics for the corresponding and preceding years (Figure 
Annual change detection metrics serve the operational update of the global forest cover change product that is developed by the GLAD team for Global Forest Watch initiative (www. globalforestwatch.org). The data users should be aware that while using four years of data to create a change detection metrics set improves the classification quality, the metric set is sensitive to changes that happened not only between the corresponding and preceding years, but also between the corresponding year and the years i-2 and i-3. The ""last annual observation"" metric may be used to exclude changes that happened earlier. Alternatively, a change detection algorithm can be applied annually to eliminate redundant change detections. | Known Issues and Limitations: The GLAD team is constantly updating the ARD product to ensure data completeness and quality. Here, we list known issues that users should consider when using the product. Some of these issues will be addressed in future revisions of the GLAD ARD. ÔÇ∑ The current version of the GLAD ARD product is not suitable for real-time land cover monitoring.
The ARD product rely on Tier 1 data which currently features up to 26 days processing delay by USGS (https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat/landsat-collection-1). A 16-day interval data are processed only after all daily data are available as Tier 1. Thus, the ARD update usually features a 1-month delay. ÔÇ∑ Landsat 5 images for 2001-2002 were filtered for possible sensor artifacts during ARD processing.
However, after examining images recently processed to Collection 1 standard we suggested that some of these artifacts were removed by the data provider. A re-processing of the year 2001 and 2002 ARD will be scheduled to include corrected L5 data. ÔÇ∑ Images crossing the 180¬∞ meridian were not processed due to technical difficulties. This issue was not addressed yet due to low demand for the data in these regions. The images will be processed and the corresponding 16-day composites will be updated later. ÔÇ∑ Due to low sun azimuth and similarity between snow cover and clouds during winter season in temperate and boreal climates, the GLAD Landsat ARD algorithm is not suitable for winter time image processing above 30N and below 45S Latitude. We are not processing images during times affected by seasonal snow cover so the resulting 16-day intervals have no data. Some of the images (and resulting 16-day composites) may still include snow-covered observations. We suggest further filtering such observations using the ""snow/ice"" observation quality flag or by removing certain 16-day intervals from data processing. ÔÇ∑ The surface reflectance normalization is not equal to a physically-based atmospheric and surface anisotropy correction. While the comparison of ARD data with MODIS-based surface reflectance and successful ARD applications for global land cover mapping suggest that the product has sufficient quality for intended use, the ARD data may not be suitable for precise analysis of land surface reflectance. ÔÇ∑ Users should be aware that the image normalization method is not designed to deal with specular reflectance and thus introduces bias over the water surfaces. We do not recommend using the ARD product for water quality assessment or any other hydrology applications beyond surface water extent mapping.

"Dynamics and Drivers of Land Use and Land Cover Changes in Migori River Watershed, Western Kenya Region",Stephen Opiyo; Godwin Opinde; Sammy Letema; Stephen Balaka,"Understanding land use and land cover (LULC) change dynamics and their contributing factors are critical for developing sustainable land management strategies. Therefore, this paper assesses the trends and patterns of LULC changes and their drivers in the Migori River watershed in Kenya from 1980 to 2020. The spatial analysis is based on remote sensing data based on the maximum likelihood classifier algorithm; whereas the analysis of the drivers is based on index-based ranking and logistic regression of 318 households' survey data. The results show that between 1980 and 2020, the watershed experienced a considerable decline in shrub lands by 40.63% (√Ä235.97 km 2 ), grasslands by 84.86% (√Ä59.14 km 2 ), forests by 52.90% (√Ä98.36 km 2 ), water by 82.03% (√Ä39.27 km 2 ) and wetlands by 38.44% (√Ä3.69 km 2 ); whereas cultivated land, bare land and built-up areas expanded over the same period by 34.25% (+347.42 km 2 ), 132.28% (+60.95 km 2 ) and 461.20% (+25.32 km 2 ), respectively. The results of the household survey revealed that the perceptions of the locals tended to corroborate these observed LULC patterns obtained from spatial analysis, with 60.50% (n = 192) of the respondents reporting a significant expansion in agricultural land use (at p < 0.05), and 75.80% (n = 241) observing a significant decline in forest areas in the watershed (at p < 0.05). Fuel wood collection, timber/poles production, agricultural expansion, population pressure, and high poverty are the major drivers of these LULC changes. The findings also revealed that educational level significantly influenced the survey participants' perceptions concerning these drivers. The paper concludes that the watershed's natural landscapes have been undergoing destruction at the expense of human settlement and infrastructural developments driven by anthropogenic activities. Therefore, there is a need, among others, for land use zoning to regulate conflicting land uses on the watershed between settlement, conservation, and agricultural lands.","Introduction: Since the 1970s, land use and land cover (LULC) change has been an important research topic, receiving significant attention from the scientific world 
Land use and land cover change have significant effects on the functioning of socio-economic and ecosystems with important tradeoffs for sustainability, biodiversity, food security, and socio-economic vulnerability of communities and ecological systems 
The present study focuses on the Migori River watershed, one of the hotspots of biodiversity situated in the Kenyan Lake Victoria basin. This region has been continuously experiencing extensive vegetation loss and fragmentation of its natural landscapes over the last few decades due to agricultural expansion, infrastructural development, and increased occurrence of natural hazards such as floods and landslides  | Materials and methods:  | Description of the study area: The Migori River watershed (Fig. 
The watershed is divided into six agro-ecological areas, ranging from Upper Midland 1-3, which covers sections of Rongo, Uriri, Kuria East, and Kuria West Sub-Counties, to Lower Midland 1-5, which covers sections of Rongo, Uriri, Nyatike and Suna East Sub-Counties  | Satellite imagery data acquisition: A combination of remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) is used to assess the trends and patterns of land use and land cover changes in the Migori River watershed between 1980 and 2020 at the recommended 10-year intervals  | Data pre-processing: After the acquisition, the raw satellite images were imported into ERDAS Imagine 2020 Version by Hexagon Geospatial for standard pre-processing procedures undertaken before classification to improve their visualization and interpretability. First, radiometric/atmospheric correction was performed to reduce the effects of haze captured on the Landsat images following the approach described by  | Data processing and analysis: After successful pre-processing and prior to classification, the training and validation datasets of different periods used for classification and accuracy assessment, respectively, were collected from the Google Earth desktop application as described  by  | Post-processing analysis: Accuracy assessment was done through the generation of confusion/error matrices in which the data from LULC classification are compared to the ground-truthing data acquired from fieldwork. This study used 160 ground reference points (20 reference points for each LULC class) and reference data extracted from Google Earth images for accuracy assessment. The positions of the reference points were automatically identified on the classified images and their class values were defined to determine the accuracy of a pixel. The statistical components of the confusion matrix namely, producer's accuracy, user's accuracy, overall accuracy, kappa statistics, and overall kappa coefficient were calculated for all the classified LULC images based on the algorithms provided in 
where r is the annual rate of change for each LULC category (in percentage), and A 2 and A 1 are areas of each LULC category at the end (t 2 ) and the beginning (t 1 ), respectively, for the period under review. | Household survey: Sample size and sampling procedure A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted between January and February 2022, among 318 randomly selected households in the Migori River watershed, using pre-tested, intervieweradministered semi-structured questionnaires. The household questionnaires consisted of various questions designed to get information on the perceptions of the local communities on LULC changes and the drivers in the Migori River watershed from 1980 to 2020. The questionnaire was initially pretested in 30 households in the Awendo Sub-county, which neighbors the watershed and isn't part of the actual survey after which the adjustments were effected before the actual household survey. Prior to the survey, village elders and local administration officials were consulted to explain the purpose of the study, understand the local realities (which helped in developing questionnaire items), and obtain permission to visit the selected households. During the exercise, the questionnaires were administered to household heads or other senior members of the selected households who had lived in the watershed for at least ten years, upon obtaining verbal consent. Cultural norms dictated that the male be interviewed as the head of the household unless absent then the spouse or adult (over 21 years) family member who understands the family and area well. Each interview lasted about 35 min on average. | Characteristics of the sampled households: A summary of the socio-economic characteristics of the respondents is presented in Table  | Statistical analyses: The LULC change analysis was conducted using ArcGIS Desktop by Esri (Version 10.2) and ERDAS Imagine 2020 by Hexagon Geospatial, in a process that combined GIS and remote sensing techniques. The socio-economic survey data was analyzed using the IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (Version 24.0) in which both descriptive statistics and regression analyses were conducted. After obtaining the descriptive statistics, ranking the LULC change drivers for the watershed based on the weighted average was computed using the Relative Importance Index (RII) equation (2) adopted by previous studies 
where R n = value of the lowest/last rank e.g. if the lowest/last rank is 5 in the Likert-scale used, then R n = 5 and R n √Ä 1 = 4; R 1 = value of the highest/first rank in the Likert-scale used, usually 1; C n = counts/number of observations on lowest/last rank; C 1 = counts/number of observations on highest/first rank; A = the highest value in the overall ranking scale, and N = total number of respondents. Logistic regression analysis is carried out using equation (3) to determine the drivers of LULC changes at the household level in the Migori River watershed. In this model, the independent variables comprised the socio-economic attributes whereas the dependent variables are the respondent's perceptions of the driving forces of LULC change. The logistic regression analysis at the household level approximated the probability of the effects of the independent variables on the dependent variables 
where Y = dependent variable indicating the likelihood that Y = 1, a = the intercept, b 1 . . . b n n = coefficients of associated independent variables, and X 1 . . . X n = independent variables. | Results and discussion:  | Accuracy assessment of the LULC classification: The classified imageries have an overall accuracy of over 86.00% (Table

Overall trend analysis of LULC changes  The proportionate coverage area of each of the eight classes extracted in the watershed from 1980 to 2020 of LULC change trends is summarized in Table 
Forest cover in the watershed seems to have declined by about 52.90% (1.48 km 2 /year) notwithstanding the forest conservation efforts since the 1980s championed by the Permanent Presidential Commission on Soil Conservation and Afforestation. This can be attributed to the expansion of rural and urban settlements and farmlands, weak enforcement of conservation laws, and increased demand for timber as raw materials for construction and fuel wood for household usage. Although grasslands exhibited an irregular pattern of spatio-temporal changes across the five reference periods, it has experienced a decline of approximately 84.86% (1.48 km 2 /year) over the past 40 years. This substantial decline in grasslands is an indication of the increasing demand for agricultural lands and the development of forests in some of the grasslands. Moreover, the irregular pattern of changes observed in grasslands from 1980 to 2020 can be attributed to the destruction by constant incidences of fire outbreaks that usually occur in the area during periods of droughts 
Similar to grasslands, the patterns of spatio-temporal changes in shrub lands showed that it has declined by 40.63% (5.90 km 2 / year) over the four-decade period, which was largely attributed to the conversion to cultivated lands and settlements due to population pressure. Since 1980, water declined by 82.03% (0.98 km 2 /year) while the wetlands shrunk by 38.44% (0.1 km 2 / year). This declining trend in areas under water and wetlands could be attributed to the emergence and growth of aquatic vegetation and invasive species in these areas, frequent occurrence of droughts in the area  | Decadal trend analysis of LULC changes: A decade-by-decade analysis of the rates of change in LULC between 1980 and 2020 in the watershed revealed specific net changes in the form of gains and losses for each class during the 1st period 
(I) The pattern of LULC changes between 1980 and 1990.
From 1980 to 1990, the watershed experienced considerable positive and negative transformations in the LULC coverage (Table 
During the same period, shrub land continued to show a negative trend with a 58.38% net loss while built-up lands continued to experience a positive trend with a net gain of 51.23%. These environmental transformations could generally be attributed to the high rate of population growth observed in Kenya from the late 1980s towards the new millennium, which was estimated to be between 3.20 and 3.60% per annum (UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2019). During the same period, the population growth rate of the entire Lake Victoria basin, under which the watershed is located, was touted to be among the highest in the country at 2.85% per year 
(III) The pattern of LULC changes between 2000 and 2010. Fig. 
(IV) The pattern of LULC changes between 2010 and 2020.
Between 2010 and 2020, grasslands declined by 86.95%, forests by 17.91%, and water by 50.09% unlike other categories that increased -shrub land by 47.56%, bare land by 69.15%, built-up area by 272.55%, and wetlands by 10.67%, with cultivated land remaining fairly constant (Table  | Land use and land cover change matrix: Table  | Watershed community perceptions on trends and drivers of LULC changes: Local community perceptions concerning the trends of LULC changes and distances to infrastructure Survey participants' perceptions of LULC trends in the Migori River watershed are presented in Fig. 
In general, the study observed that the watershed communities are sufficiently aware of changes in natural resources and changes related to infrastructure development. Moreover, the usage of older respondents (!21 years), of which half had lived in the watershed throughout the period under review for LULC changes, yielded an accurate historical account of LULC changes in the watershed, corroborating the observed LULC trends interpreted from remotely sensed data in the period of 1980-2020. This local attention to LULC changes including infrastructure development can provide valuable input for government strategies to execute a suitable spatial plan for the watershed. Combining LULC maps with local perceptions of LULC changes enables enhanced interpre- Note: The bold and italicized entries along the diagonal represent the LULC areal coverages that remained unchanged between 1980 and 2020. tation of the land use information, which can help the government to develop a spatial plan that considers socio-economic and ecological circumstances and engages local people in decision-making. | Ranked drivers of land use and land cover changes in the watershed: The survey identified 11 major proximate/direct drivers of LULC change in the watershed (Table 
Concerning the underlying/indirect drivers, that is the forces that indirectly trigger the proximate causes 
In the survey, approximately 95% agreed that the population of the area has increased over the period under review, which corroborated with population data that indicate that the population of the Migori County where the watershed is situated has grown by 
Poverty is pervasive in the Kenyan Lake Victoria Basin in which the Migori River watershed occurs, as most households live below the poverty line 
Due to the high poverty levels, about 93% of the watershed households use three-stone open fire for cooking (Table 
Although weak government policies regarding natural resources conservation didn't come out strongly among the top underlying drivers of LULC changes in the watershed identified by the survey, weak law enforcement did; which implies that appropriate government policies are in place but their enforcement is weak and ineffective and therefore may not curtail unsustainable land management practices. The various protected areas such as forest blocks, wetlands, cultural sites, and water sources in the watershed are governed by various government policies developed over the years such as the Environmental Management and Conservation Act 1999 (which mandates environmental management with the goal of attaining sustainable land-based natural resources like forests, wetlands, and water catchment landscapes), Forest Conservation and Management Act 2016 (which provides for the establishment, protection, conservation, and sustainable utilization and management of forests and forest resources for maintenance and conservation of water catchment areas), Water Act 2016 (which tackles the. utilization of water resources to meet human and animal needs, the sustainable management protection of watershed ecosystems), and Land Act 2012 (which emphasizes sustainable conservation, management, and protection of land resources including critical biodiversity, forests, and fragile ecosystems), and Wildlife Conservation and Management Act 2013 (provides for the sustainable protection, conservation, and management of water catchment areas including forests and wetlands existing within the game parks, reserves and protected areas). These government policies generally prohibit logging for timber or deforestation for fuel wood collection, settlement, or agricultural expansion within these protected areas, the government has been lax in providing the enforcement required to curtail such practices from continuing in the watershed, which may be due to the recognition of the high poverty levels experienced by the rapidly growing population. Therefore law enforcement continues to be an important trigger for these anthropogenic-induced causes of LULC changes. | Household-level logistic regression of perceived drivers of land use and land cover changes: Logistic regression analysis was carried out to determine the drivers of LULC changes at the household level in the Migori River watershed (Table  | Conclusions and recommendations: The study established that the major land use in the watershed during the period under review is cultivated land with an average of 61.44% overall coverage of the total land area during the entire period hence the livelihoods of the watershed inhabitants have been historically agriculture-dependent. The decline in shrub lands by 40.63%, grasslands by 84.86%, forests by 52.90%, water by 82.03%, and wetlands by 38.44%; coupled with increased cultivated land by 34.25%, bare land by 132.28%, and built-up areas by 461.20% over the period under review indicate that the natural landscapes in the watershed are undergoing destruction at the expense of human settlement and infrastructural developments. Fuel wood collection, timber/pole production, shifting cultivation, agricultural expansion, charcoal production, population pressure, and high poverty level are the topmost drivers perceived by the watershed communities to be contributing to the land use and land cover changes in the watershed. Since all these identified drivers are still active in the watershed, the natural landscapes are likely to decline further, with negative implications on watershed ecosystem services, biodiversity, and community livelihoods. Gen- erally, the study observed that the watershed communities are sufficiently aware of changes in natural resources and changes related to infrastructure development. This local attention to land use and land cover changes including infrastructure development can provide valuable input for government strategies to execute a suitable spatial plan for the watershed. Integration of spatial LULC analysis with local perceptions of LULC changes enables enhanced interpretation of the land use information, which can help the government to develop a spatial plan that considers socio-economic and ecological circumstances and engages local people in decision-making.
The paper recommends land use zoning on the watershed area to demarcate land areas into settlement areas, conservation, and protected areas, and agricultural lands as well as regulate physical development and use of fragile conservation areas like forests, wetlands, and water sources. Efforts should be directed towards the adoption of alternative cooking energy types by watershed households to reduce the overall demand for fuel wood and consequently ease pressure on forests. The government should also harmonize the existing conservation policies to align them with the interests and priorities of the local watershed communities to balance competing goals for effective management and conservation of the watershed.","Detecting and analyzing land use and land cover changes in the region of Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar, Libya using time-series landsat data from 1985 to 2017 (, , , , , , 2020) || Assessing the trends and drivers of land use land cover change in district Abbottabad lower Himalayan Region Pakistan (, , , , 2022) || Land-use and land-cover changes in the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia: Assessment of perception and adaptation of stakeholders (, , , 2015) || Relative importance index (RII) in ranking of procrastination factors among university students (, , , , , , 2016.

Influence of the Changes in Land-Use and Land Cover on Temperature over Northern and North-Eastern India,Sridhara Nayak; Suman Maity; Kuvar Singh; Hara Nayak; Soma Dutta,"This study explores the influence of land-use and land cover (LULC) changes on the temperature over North India (NI) and North-Eastern India (NEI) during 1981-2006 by subtracting the reanalysis temperature from the observed temperature (observation minus reanalysis (OMR) method). The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data of the AVHRR satellite for the period 1981-2006 were analyzed to understand the type of LULC changes during this period and their linkage with the temperature change over the two regions. The results from OMR indicated that the LULC change over NI during 1981-2006 resulted a warming of 0.03 ‚Ä¢ C, and that of NEI during this period resulted a cooling of 1.5 ‚Ä¢ C.
The results from LULC changes during the said period indicated an increase of dry land/snow cover and agriculture/fallow land by ~0.1% of total area and a decrease of shrubs/small vegetation and dense forest over NI by about 0.1-0.2%. Over NEI, the areas under agricultural/fallow land, open forest and dense forest showed an increase by about 0.8-2.4% during this period, and the areas under dry/snow cover and shrubs/small vegetation indicated a decrease by ~0.7-3.6%. The comparison between the OMR analysis and LULC changes indicated that the warming over NI during 1981-2006 is due to the expansion of the dry land and the decline of dense forest. On the other hand, the cooling over NEI during the period is attributed to the decline of non-vegetated/small vegetated lands and the expansion of agricultural land/forest covers in that period. This study has an overall implication towards the modeling studies for the impact assessment of LULC changes in the present as well as future climate.","Introduction: Recent studies have revealed that anthropogenic forcing due to the changes in land-use and land cover (LULC) is one of the responsible factors for the temperature change in recent decades 
Northern India (NI), located in the north part of India, comprising the states of Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Haryana, Punjab, Chandigarh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, and the union territories of Delhi. North-Eastern India (NEI), located at the easternmost part of India, consists of eight states viz. Sikkim, Assam, Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, and Nagaland.

Similarly, LULC changes over Eastern India contributed towards warming at a rate of ~2 ¬∞C per decade during 1991-2006 due to conversion of small vegetation into bare lands, while it resulted in cooling during 1981-1990 due to an increase of dense forests and agricultural lands

A location map of the two regions viz. NI and NEI are depicted in Figure 
Previous studies  | Materials and Methods: The reanalysis daily temperature datasets were obtained from the NCER/NCAR Reanalysis (NNRP1) over NI and NEI regions, and the observed daily temperature was taken from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) at 16 different stations for the period 1981-2006. The geographical locations of each station are given in Table 
where T s is the reanalysis temperature at the station, d i -1 is the Euclidean distance from the station to the corner point g i , Tg i is the reanalysis temperature at point g i . The temperature trends over the regions are then estimated from the linear trends in the reanalysis and observed temperature anomalies during 1981-2006 with respect to their 26 years means. Finally, we subtracted the reanalysis temperature trend from the observed temperature trend to calculate the contribution of LULC changes towards the temperature over the regions. This method of estimating the impact of LULC changes on the temperature is known as the observation minus reanalysis (OMR) method 
The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images from AVHRR products are classified into different LULC types at 8 km resolution for the years 1981, 1991, and 2006 by using the hierarchy approach of LULC types

We found that the LULC change during 1981-2006 resulted warming of 0.034 ‚Ä¢ C over NI, while it caused cooling of 1.5 ‚Ä¢ C over NEI during this period. Our results over NI were found to be qualitatively comparable with the previous studies conducted over other regions of India 
We further attempted to investigate the changes in LULC over NI and NEI during 1981-2006 from the AVHRR satellite datasets to understand the type of LULC changes and their linkage with the temperature change over these two regions. Analysis indicated that the warming over NI during 1981-2006 could be due to expansion of the areas under dry land/snow cover and reduction of areas under dense forest during this period. The cooling over NEI during 1981-2006 could be due to the decline of non-vegetated/small vegetated lands and the expansion of agricultural land/forest covers in that period. It is noticed that the dry land/snow cover and shrubs/small vegetation are largely decreased over NEI during 1981-2006. The reason for the decreased areas under these categories over NEI could be attributed to the snowmelt  | Conclusions: This study explored the influences of LULC changes on the temperature trend during 1981-2006 over two regions (NI and NEI) of India. The reanalysis temperature over each region was subtracted from the observed temperature over the corresponding region. The so-called ""observation minus reanalysis"" (OMR) method was used to quantify the impact of LULC changes on the temperature over both regions. The results indicated that due to the LULC changes during 1981-2006, NI experienced a warming of 0.034 ‚Ä¢ C, while NEI experienced cooling of 1.5 ‚Ä¢ C during this period. AVHRR satellite images were deployed to recognize the LULC changes occurring during this period over NI and NEI and to understand their linkage with the surface temperature change. Overall analysis inferred an expansion of the areas under dry land/snow cover over NI during 1981-2006 and a reduction of areas under dense forest over the same region in that period. This may lead to warming over NI during 1981-2006.

Abstract: Land use land cover (LULC) change detection based on remote sensing data is an important source of information for various decision support systems. Information derived from land use and land cover change detection is important to land conservation, sustainable development, and management of water resources. This purpose of this study is therefore concerned with identifying the change in land use and land cover detection of the Tana basin. To identify land cover changes detection; remote sensing data, satellite imagery and image processing techniques had done within three dates of 1986, 2002 and 2018 using Land sat TM 30 m resolution images. ENVI and Arc GIS soft wares had used to identify the changes. The classification had done using six land cover (water body, bushland, grassland, forestland, cultivated, and residential land) class. Preprocessing and classification of the images had analyzed carefully and accuracy assessment was tested separately using the kappa coefficient. The results showed that overall accuracy in the basin was 84.21%, 83.32% and 91.40% and kappa coefficient of 79.02%, 83.32%, 89.66% for the years 1986, 2002 and 2018 respectively. This study indicated that in the last 32 years period, agricultural land and residential areas had significantly increased by 15.61% and 8.05% respectively in the basin. Therefore, proper land management  | PUBLIC INTEREST STATEMENT: Human activities are one of the main driving forces of land use and land cover changes, and generally in natural environments. Land-use change affects the nature of the climate, cause natural hazards and socio-economic dynamics on a global and local scale. Therefore, defining the land-use change is an important issue considering global dynamics and their response to the water flow, forest, soil, and rainfall and runoff characteristics of the catchment or basins. In addition to that investigating land use, land cover change is important for effective sustainable land resource management, effective utilization of the natural resource, and use as a tool for policymakers and understanding the changes in hydrological processes. Therefore, this study is an important hint for decision-makers to understand the dynamic nature of the basin for the last decades and to take measures based on the finding.
practices, integrated watershed management, and active participation of the local community should be advance to protect undesirable LULC change in the basin. | Introduction: The land use and land cover change of an area is an outcome of natural and socio-economic aspects and their operation by the human in time and space. Land use land cover (LULC) changes are mostly influenced by increase and decrease in population growth in the system 
Change detection is valuable in many applications related to land use and land cover (LULC) changes detection including cultivation, urban expansion and landscape changes 
In most developing countries like Ethiopia, population growth has been a dominant cause of land use and land cover change 
Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the trend of land use and land cover change in the Tana basin of Northwest Ethiopia. In this study, LULC changes had investigated using remote sensing data with the help of GIS and ENVI software. Therefore, we expect that the finding of this study could contribute information for decision-makers, land managers and planners for sustainable development and management of the natural resource. | Materials and methods:  | Description of the study area: Lake Tana is the source of the Blue Nile River and the lake covers 3,060 km 2 at elevation 1,786 masl. The lake is the largest in Ethiopia and the third-largest in the Nile Basin. The basin has minimum elevation at the flood plain of Fogera, Dembia, and Gilgel Abay while the maximum elevation is about 4109 masl in the mountainous area. It is located at 12¬∞00 π Northing and 37¬∞15 π Easting which is 564 km from the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa (Figure  | Materials: Landsat image is a special sensor onboard the Landsat Satellite platform and is capable of capturing multispectral imagery. Landsat multispectral images capture many bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, including visible, reflective infrared and thermal infrared energy. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different types of sensor data is essential for the selection of suitable remotely sensed data for image classification  | Methodology: In remote sensing studies, a representative ground truth data is a prerequisite to associate this reflectance property to the object and the train classifiers and facilitate accurate automatic classification  | Land use and land cover classification: To perform image classification, the raw data must be preprocessed and prepared properly so that error due to the geometry of the earth, radiometric and atmospheric effects could be accounted for. The general procedure in the preprocessing stage has included the detection and restoration of bad lines, geometric rectification or image registration, radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, and topographic correction. | Supervised image classification: In this process, we select pixels that represent patterns we recognize, or that we could identify with help from other sources (Google earth) information. Knowledge of the data, the classes desired, and the algorithms to be used were required before we begin selecting training samples. By setting priorities to these classes, we had supervised the classification of pixels as they had assigned to a class value. | Accuracy assessment: A classified image or change detection map needs to be compared against reference data, assumed to be true, to assess its performance and quantify its accuracy  | Image processing: The procedure in the preprocessing stage was including the detection and restoration of bad lines, geometric rectification or image registration, radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, and topographic correction. Accurate geometric rectification or image registration of remotely sensed data is a prerequisite for a combination of different source data in a classification process  | Change detection: The importance of change detection is to determine which land-use class is changing to the other. The most commonly used land change detection methods include image overlay, classification comparisons of land cover statistics, change vector analysis, principal component analysis, image rationing and the differencing of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)  | Results and discussion:  | Land use and land cover analysis: To assess the classification accuracy, confusion matrix had used including overall accuracy, user's accuracy, and producer's accuracy. Classification is not complete until its accuracy is assessed using the known Kappa statistics  | Overall accuracy: This accuracy gives the overall results of the confusion matrix. It is calculated by dividing the total number of correct pixels (diagonal values) by the total number of pixels in the confusion matrix. According to  | Kappa coefficient (KC): The Kappa statistic had used to measure the agreement between two sets of categorizations of a dataset (Table 
In this study, 116, 139 and 162 number of ground control points had used to validate the classified images for 1986, 2002 and 2018 respectively using Global Positioning System (GPS) point from Google earth on the field in addition to the unchanged ground control point. The accuracy had performed separately for the 
Generally, the results (Table  | Land use and land cover maps: The spatial analysis had carried out to describe land cover change patterns and overall land-use changes with time. Forestland, bush/shrubland, Grassland, Cultivated land, and Residential area were the major land use and land cover classes of the basin. Land use land cover change (Figure 
Analyses of the result indicated that bushland was the dominant land cover class of 19. 39 and 15.82 % next to Agricultural land 37.56 and 43.12 % in 1986 and 2002 respectively. This result reveals that the main source of income was agriculture during this period. Analysis of the 2018 image revealed that agricultural land constituted the largest proportion while bushland was the second dominant coverage of 9.56 % next to Agricultural land in the basin. This result is due to the expansion of population growth and the increments of human needs. Generally, the result indicates that forestland, bushland, and grassland had decreased while residential areas and cultivated land had increased this may be due to the increment of population growth and high demand for agricultural production.
LULC change detection in the basin revealed that agricultural land and settlement areas increased from 1984 to 2018 in the last 32 years (Table  | Change detection analysis: The land use and land cover change detection based on remote sensing images have been widely applied in research for LUCC, natural resource management and environment monitoring & protection  | Conclusions: In this study, LULC detection of Lake Tana basin over the last three decades had analyzed. The result of the study showed that significant change detection had observed during the study period. Agriculture and residential/urban areas showed an increasing trend of 13 and 9.1 %, respectively, while forest, bushland, and grassland showed a decreasing trend of 2.3, 9.8 and 10 %, respectively. This result revealed that the change of forest, bushland, and grassland to agricultural and residential areas which may problems including change in streamflow, soil degradation, and hydrological system in the basin. These changes could have implications for sustainable resource management and the livelihood of the local society. Therefore, improved land management practices (soil and water conservation), improved agricultural inputs, integrated watershed management (land use planning and management), and active participation of local community should be advance to prevent undesirable LULC dynamics in the basin. In this study, the change detection analysis using GIS and remote sensing could deliver useful information to understand the seasonal patterns of land use dynamics for planners and decision-makers consequently sustainable land management planning is possible.","Land use change detection using remote sensing and artificial neural network: Application to Birjand (, 2014) || Impacts of rainfall variability, land use and land cover change on stream flow of the black Volta Basin (, , , 2016) || Longterm dynamics in land resource use and the driving forces in the Beressa watershed, highlands of Ethiopia (, , , 2007) || A land use and land cover classification system for use with remote sensor data (, 1976) || Land use and land cover dynamics and drivers in the Muga watershed (, , 2019) || Land cover dynamics since the 1950s in Chemoga watershed (, 2002) || Land use land cover changes along topographic gradients in Hugumburda national forest priority area, Northern Ethiopia (, , , , , , 2019. 2018) || Assessing the land use/cover dynamics and its impact on the low flow of Gumara Watershed (, , 2017) || A simple and effective radiometric correction method to improve landscape change detection across sensors and across time (, , , 2005) || Status of land cover classification accuracy assessment (, 2002) || Dynamics of land-use and landcover change in Freetown, Sierra Leone and its effects on urban and peri-urban agriculture -A remote sensing approach (, , 2011) || Land-use and land-cover dynamics in the central rift valley of Ethiopia (, , , , 2009) || Assessing the impacts of land use and land cover change on hydrology of watershed: A case study on Gigel-Abbay Watershed (, 2013) || Optical remotely sensed time series data for land cover classification: A review (, , , 2016) || Evaluating land-use change in rapidly urbanizing China: Case study of Shanghai (, , , , 2009. 2009) || Monitoring urban growth and land use change detection with GIS and Tewabe & Fentahun (, , 2015. 2020. 1778998) || The spatiotemporal form of urban growth: Measurement, analysis and modeling (, , , 2003) || The implications of changes in population, land use, and land management for surface runoff in the upper Nile basin area of Ethiopia (, , , 2005. 2005) || Pattern and development of land-use changes in the Kenyan highlands since the 1950s.

Land Cover Change Detection Techniques,,"2 0274-6638/21¬©2021IEEE IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING MAGAZINE MONTH 2021
L and cover change detection (LCCD) with remote sens- ing images is an important application of Earth observation data because it provides insights into environmental health, global warming, and city management. In particular, very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images can capture details of a ground object and offer an opportunity to detect land cover changes in detail.
However, VHR images usually have high spatial resolution but contain limited spectral information. Therefore, LCCD with VHR optimal images performs poorly because of high intraclass variation and low interclass variance. In the past decades, various approaches have been promoted to smoothen noise, reduce pseudochanges, and preserve the details of detection maps with VHR images.
In this article, we first present an overview of the main issues in terms of algorithms, applications, and referred characteristics to promote a comprehensive and general understanding of the development of LCCD with VHR remote sensing images. Several key methodologies are compared with three pairs of real VHR optimal images. Finally, we discuss future challenges and opportunities in applying VHR remote sensing images in LCCD.","VHR IMAGE: Numerous remote sensing platforms, such as QuickBird, GeoEye, Worldview, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), can capture ground details with VHR, given the considerable progress in remote sensing technology 
However, many studies have demonstrated that high resolution does not automatically mean high detection accuracy in practical applications because of the following reasons: ‚óó VHR images usually have a higher intraclass variation than low-or medium-resolution images, resulting in decreased separability between different entities, such as roads and buildings 
Figure 
A VHR image generally has a fine resolution in the spatial domain and a coarse resolution in the spectral domain, but it can describe ground targets in detail in terms of their texture, structure, shape, and size. In recent decades, VHR remote sensing images have been used successfully in many practical applications, such as land cover classification  | METHODOLOGY: Some rules must be defined to retrieve articles on LCCD using VHR remote sensing optical images from a database. In this study, several constraints were defined and applied to achieve the objective: ‚óó All of the articles are indexed from the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection database and were published from 2001 to 2019. ‚óó The article titles should contain ""very high resolution"" or ""VHR"" and ""change detection."" ""Bitemporal images"" or ""remote sensing images"" were used to refine the search results. ‚óó If ""object"" and ""change detection"" were included in an article's title, then the article would be selected for analysis because object-based techniques are generally employed for processing VHR images 
Based on these criteria, 356 articles were selected after applying the constraints and excluding rules. Moreover, the total number of published articles on LCCD with VHR remote sensing images in each year increased from 2001 to 2019 (Figure  | REVIEW OF THE MAJOR TECHNIQUES OF LCCD WITH VHR OPTICAL IMAGES:  | IMAGE PREPROCESSING IN LCCD: LCCD usually refers to bitemporal or multitemporal images. Thus, preprocessing is required to reduce pseudochanges caused by geometry position errors and spectral reflectance phenological differences. Here, the two widely employed preprocessing steps for change detection are analyzed as follows.
In LCCD with VHR images, geometric coregistration between bitemporal images in terms of a geographical position is an important preprocessing task because misregistration will bring noise to the detection map 
Han et al. 
However, coregistration between bitemporal images depends on the data preprocessing level. In general, ground control points (GCPs) are needed to achieve the coregistration, and GCPs are usually collected by data providers 
In addition to the preprocessing of coregistration, radiometric cocorrection between bitemporal images is required to reduce pseudochanges in LCCD 
To solve this problem, scholars have developed many methods, such as radiometric normalization  | EXPLORATION OF NEIGHBORING CONTEXT: A number of studies have demonstrated that utilizing spatial contextual information can help improve the detection performance of LCCD with VHR optimal images  | REGULAR NEIGHBORING CONTEXT: similarity 
In addition, regular structural elements coupled with morphological operations are widely used to extract neighboring contextual features in LCCD 
In recent years, many deep learning LCCD frameworks have been developed by dividing image pairs into regular blocks to utilize contextual information, based on such approaches as the convolutional neural network (CNN) 
In addition to constructing a regular geometry around a central pixel to explore neighboring contextual information, mathematical models are widely used to obtain invariant features around a central pixel and measure the change magnitude between pairwise images. Some examples of such mathematical models are Markov random field (MRF)  | MULTISCALE NEIGHBORING CONTEXT: Multiscale techniques can be used to obtain neighboring contextual information around a pixel in bitemporal VHR images (Table 
In recent decades, many object-based methods have been developed for LCCD with VHR images. For example, object-level features were extracted to detect land cover change 
Object-based uncertainty analyses were also used in other studies 
Furthermore, the parameter setting of many multiscale segmentation algorithms is dependent on the user's experience 
Second, multiscale deep learning networks are popular when LCCD is applied on VHR images. These networks include the multiscale CNN 
Other multiscale techniques applicable to LCCD are the multiscale hierarchy LCCD framework  | ADAPTIVE NEIGHBORING CONTEXT: Adaptive neighboring context is another LCCD branch used to cover the various shapes and sizes of ground targets in a scene (Table 
Many adaptive-scale-based LCCD methods have been developed in the past decades. These include methods based on the adaptive window size 
Therefore, the influence of neighboring pixels on the central pixel varies with the spectral reflection of the ground target itself. One advantage of adaptive-scale LCCD methods lies in maintaining the shape of ground targets, improving the homogeneity, and preserving the details of the change area. However, the parameter tuning of adaptivescale methods is generally required in practical application. | OTHER METHODS FROM COMPUTER VISION: In addition to the mentioned LCCD methods, computer vision techniques, such as the binary descriptors algorithms 
Many widely used computer vision techniques, such as line feature extraction  | RESULTS OF THE LCCD AND PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT: Two kinds of change detection maps exist in practical applications. The first major type is called the binary change detection map, and it can only describe the shape, size, and distribution of land cover change. The other is called the multitask change detection map 
In addition to multitask change detection methods, ""from-to"" change information can be acquired through the feature analysis of ground targets. For example, Wen et al. 
Binary change detection is the most widely used in the family of LCCD with VHR optical images. In addition, one advantage of postclassification-based LCCD methods is their ability to provide ""from-to"" change information. However, the detection accuracy and performance depends on the classification performance, and the large intraclass variations in VHR images led to difficulty in distinguishing among different classes 
In summary, accuracy assessment is a quantitative measurement to compare and test the performance of an algorithm. Intuitively, this quantitative measurement is achieved by comparing the result of an algorithm with the corresponding ground truth map (GTM). After the indicators employed in the literature were reviewed 
By analyzing the definition of each formula, it can be observed that different indicators have an unequal bias for evaluation, and the performance of a specific algorithm may be better or worse than the one of other methods, depending on the indicator. In numerous practical applications and performance assessments of algorithms, three of the nine indicators are usually selected to assess the performance of an algorithm (i.e., FA, MA, and Ka were adopted in  | EXPERIMENTS: To investigate the performance of LCCD approaches in comparison with VHR optical images, this section compares eight widely used approaches, including three unsupervised methods (CVA_MRF 
The performance of each algorithm was evaluated by using the nine indicators described in Table  | DISCUSSION: To obtain an overview of the development of LCCD with VHR optical images, we statistically analyzed the articles referred to. In accordance with the perspective and focus of these articles, we discussed LCCD with VHR optical images from the following viewpoints: technology, application, data sets, and accuracy assessment. The details of this quantitative analysis are presented in the following sections. | TECHNIQUES: As mentioned in the previous section, here, we dichotomized the major LCCD methods into four groups in terms of different manners of utilizing spatial contextual information: regular neighboring context 
Moreover, the optimal parameter's setting of an adaptive context exploration algorithm for a specific data set remains a challenge  | Missing alarm (MA) MA TP FN FN = +: The ratio between the number of pixels that are identified as ""unchanged"" but are changed in the GTM and the number of pixels that are changed in the GTM. | Total error (TE) TE TP TN FP FN TP TN: The ratio between the number of pixels that are identified as ""unchanged"" but are changed in the GTM and the number of pixels that are changed in the GTM.
Overall accuracy (OA) OA TP TN FP FN TP TN = + + + | +: The ratio between the number of correctly detected pixels in the result and the total number of the GTM. 
The AA is for two ratios: one is the ratio between the true changed pixel in the results and the changed pixel in the GTM, and the other is the ratio between the true unchanged pixel in the results and the unchanged pixels in the GTM. | Completeness (CP) CP TP FN TP = +: The ratio between the number of changed pixels that are correctly identified and the number of the pixels that are changed in the GTM. | Correctness (CR) CR TP FP TP = +: The ratio between the number of changed pixels that are correctly identified and the total number of changed pixels in the result.
The ratio between the number of changed pixels that are correctly identified and the number of total changed pixels in the results and GTM. Based on these observations, 92 study areas were located in the urban region, accounting for 30% of the total quantity. In addition, building change detection played an important role in change detection with VHR optical images, accounting for 23.8% of the 307 applications in the 356 articles. However, the application of such methods to disaster change detection, such as earthquake and landslide inventory mapping, has not gained sufficient attention, probably because of the difficulty of acquiring pre-and postevent images for natural disaster events. Furthermore, coregistration between bitemporal images becomes challenging because land cover disasters, such as landslides and earthquakes, usually result in the deformation of ground elevation. | DATA SETS: Data sets are important in investigating the performance of LCCD algorithms. If an algorithm adapts to more kinds of data sets with different resolutions, then it may have better adaptability and robustness 
In addition, the size of the study areas mentioned in the articles is reviewed. Area units were measured in square kilometers, and five ranges were divided for quantitative analysis, where S denotes the study area size (Figure 
That is because, in general, for specific geographical areas, the complexity of spatial certainty increases with an increase in the size of a geographic area  | ACCURACY ASSESSMENT: The quantitative accuracies of each approach and data set in the experimental section well demonstrated that it is difficult to mark one method as ""good"" or ""bad"" in terms of the nine assessment indicators. For example, for data set A, the developed DCVA  | CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES OF LCCD WITH VHR IMAGES: Despite the numerous approaches for LCCD with VHR images that have been developed, challenges still exist in practical applications. In this study, these were mentioned from the viewpoint of practitioners, and opportunities were discussed from the perspective of researchers. The details of the challenges and opportunities are presented as follows:
‚óó Radiometric cocorrection requires additional attention: Despite the availability of various LCCD techniques, radiometric cocorrection is required for images used in LCCD.
The effect of radiometric cocorrection between bitemporal images on the accuracy of change detection maps still requires further investigation. Bitemporal images used in LCCD are usually acquired on different dates, and the process may vary in terms of sun height, atmospheric conditions, and even the phenology season. Thus, a radiometric difference exists between bitempo- (d) KPVD 
ral images. The radiometric cocorrection of noise should be considered in comprehensive analyses to promote the development of the method and reduce the radiometric difference between bitemporal images in LCCD. ‚óó LCCD based on bitemporal images with different resolutions is attractive in practical applications: In the selected 356 articles, only two mentioned different resolutions in LCCD with VHR images  | CONCLUSION: LCCD with VHR optical images plays an important role in remote sensing. This approach provides an opportunity to discover, describe, and analyze land cover changes on Earth's surface. The rapid development of remote sensing platforms has provided the convenient availability of VHR remote sensing images. VHR optical images have become an important data source for the detection of land cover change. Designing advanced algorithms for these images is necessary to increase the popularity of change detection with VHR images and their potential applications in practical engineering.
In this article, the problems of LCCD with VHR remote sensing images were reviewed and analyzed in terms of algorithms, data sets, and applications. Challenges and opportunities were then discussed. Our study provides an overview of the available LCCD methods with VHR remote sensing images. Furthermore, the characteristics of the (d) KPVD 
study areas mentioned in the corresponding methods in the literature, such as data sources and size, were quantitatively analyzed. Results may provide an objective assessment for future investigations.
In general, many issues, such as implementing an advanced radiometric cocorrection method in the preprocessing of bitemporal images to reduce a radiometric difference, still require further investigation and analysis. Almost all object-based LCCD methods focus on utilizing low-level object-based features of a single object, such as the spectral mean, textural characteristics, and other statistical features. High-level features, such as the topology of an object and its neighbors, should be extensively analyzed in future studies. Furthermore, time series images of an area have become available, and time series change detection and change trend analysis must be considered in LCCD with VHR remote sensing images.

Detection of land use/cover change in Egyptian Nile Delta using remote sensing,M Elagouz; S Abou-Shleel; A Belal; M El-Mohandes,"The present study aims to assess the changes of different land use/land cover classes for Nile Delta of Egypt during the period from 1987 to 2015, to evaluate the impact of land cover change and urban sprawl, before, during and after the 25th of January 2011 using remote sensing and GIS techniques, as a result to unplanned urban sprawl which was done by people during the lack of general security of Egyptian revolution. The results indicated that there was a regular trend characterized in most classes and that the change in different land use/land cover classes ranged between increase and decrease areas. A continuous increase in agricultural, urban, fish farms and natural vegetation areas and a continuous decrease in water bodies and sand areas were detected in the studied area. The agricultural area recorded the highest increase during the period from 1987 to 2000 (305296.1 ha.) while it increased by 170578.1 ha., during the period from 2000 to 2015. However, in urban area, the highest increase was recorded during the period from 2000 to 2015 followed by the period 1987-2000 with mean values of 97940.8 and 53112.6 ha., respectively. The analysis of the results showed that most of Egyptian Delta governorates have been significantly affected by the different classes of land use/land cover change due to agriculture activities, urban growth as a result of human activities dynamic impact.","Introduction: Egyptian Nile Delta is one of the oldest agricultural areas in the world as it is under continuous cultivation since thousands of years. The estimated cultivated area in the Delta was 1,828,840 ha. that representing 63.0% of Egyptian cultivated area 
However, the inventory of cultivated area which conducted by traditional surveying methods is become difficult and inaccurate way due to urban encroachment on cultivated land 
Remote sensing is very successful tools in agricultural field where digital data availability, for two decades minimum, in multiple wavebands of the spectrum and their large ground coverage makes it superior to field-based study 
The present investigation aimed to assess the changes of land use/cover classes in Egyptian Nile Delta feature classes using remote sensing data in order to determine type as well as the conversion rate among different land use/land cover types in the studied area. | Materials and methods:  | Study area: The Nile Delta is formed in Northern Egypt where the Nile River spreads out and drains into the Mediterranean Sea  | Data collection: Three different types of Landsat images (Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+, and Landsat 8 OLI TIRS) were obtained from the USGS earth explorer website. Landsat 5 TM images, consist of seven spectral bands with wavelengths of 0.45 lm to 2.35 lm and the spatial resolution of 30 m for Bands 1 to 5 and 7, meanwhile spatial resolution for band 6 (thermal infrared) is 120 m. Landsat 7 ETM+, consist of eight bands with wavelengths of 0.45 lm to 2.35 lm and spatial resolution for bands 1,2,3,4,5,7 are 30 but bands 6 and 8 are 60 and15m respectively. Landsat 8 OLI TIRS, consists of eleven bands with a spatial resolution of 30 m for Bands 1-7, and 9 have a spatial resolution of 30 m, bands 10 and 11(thermal bands) (TIRS) has 100 m, meanwhile band 8 (panchromatic) has spatial resolution of 15 m. To achieve the study objectives three different dates for the images were used 14/7/1987, 11/7/2000 and 5/7/2015, respectively. | Image preprocessing: Digital image preprocessing was manipulated by the used software. The scenes were selected to be geometrically corrected by using EVNVI 5.1 software, calibrated and removed from their dropouts. After that, the atmospheric correction was done for visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared data in all different types of Landsat images. Atmospheric analysis of subtraction method (dark-object) model was used to correct the atmosphere effect on reflected data according to  | Image processing: Image processing was carried out using ENVI 5.1 software. An unsupervised classification was performed using the iterative self-organizing data analysis (ISODATA) algorithms in order to identify the classes that could be found in the study area, ISODATA unsupervised classification calculates class means evenly distributed in the data space then iteratively clusters the remaining pixels using minimum distance techniques. The supervised classification was conducted based on the support vector machine technique by selected sigmoid model in ENVI 5.1 software according to  | Post classification change detection: Comparison change detection was done after classifying the rectified images separately from three time periods  | Statistical analysis: The significance of determined differences between calculated means values was done using ''SPSS software ver. 20"" according to  | Results and discussion:  | Land use/land cover change detection in Nile Delta: The obtained classified images, after pre-processing and supervised classification indicated the different land use and land cover patterns in the studied area (Fig. 
As for agriculture activities the cultivated areas were significantly increased continuously during the period from 1987 to 2015 where the recorded rate of changes was 16.5% and 7.9% during 
Concerning urban area, the year of 2015 recorded the highest value followed by the year of 2000 and 1987. The rate of urban ration was increased in the period 1987-2000 by 34.8% from the study area, while increased in the period 2000-2015 by 47.6%. The total change rate in the period from 1987 to 2015 by 99.0% (Table 
The opposite trend was observed with water bodies' where the largest area was detected in the year 1987 and decreased the years in 2000 and 2015. The change detection results showed a decrease in waterlogged areas as the decrease rate was √Ä15.2% in 1987-2000 and in the next period 2000-2015 the rate of decrease in the overall area reached √Ä14.4%. The total change for the period from 1987 to 2015 was √Ä57698.3 ha. with a rate of decrease by √Ä27.4%.
Regarding fish farms, the largest number was recorded in the year 2015 while the numbers were lower in 2000 and 1987. It was observed that the change in fish farms area increased by 71745.0 ha during the period 1987-2000, with a rate of 145.9%, while it increased by 59475.6 ha during the period 2000-2015, with a rate of 49.2%. The total change during the period from 1987 to 2015 was 131220.6 ha. recording increasing rate of 266.8%.
Concerning the natural vegetation area, the results indicated that the year of 2015 recorded the largest area followed by the years 2000 and 1987. The results of change detection showed that the natural vegetation area was increased during the period 1987-2000 where the increasing rate was 21.6% while it increased by 3.4% during the period 2000-2015. The total change for the period from 1987 to 2015was 13165.7 ha. with increasing rate 25.8%.
As for the sabkha, a continuous decrease was detected from 1987 to 2015. The decreasing rate recorded √Ä39.1%, and √Ä34.9% for the periods from 1987 to 2000 and from 2000 to 2015, respectively, with a total change rate of √Ä60.3% for the whole period from 1987 to 2015.
Salts and bare soils exhibited different patterns of change. As for salts, the area was decreased in 2000 compared to the area in 1987 with change rate of √Ä34.7% whereas it increased in 2015 compared to 2000 recording change rate 1.1%. However, Salts area in 2015 remained lower compared to that in 1987. The total rate of change during the period from 1987 to 2015 was √Ä34.0%. As for bare soils, the area was decreased in 2000 compared to 1987 with change rate of √Ä13.4%. In 2015 the bare soils area was increased compared to the area in 2000 and 1987. The recorded change rate was 60.4% during the period from 2000 to 2015 whereas the total change rate during the whole period of study was 38.8%. The sand area followed the same change pattern that was recorded for both water bodies and sabkha area where it decreased continuously from 1987 to 2015 and recorded a total change rate of √Ä36.4%.
These results could be attributed to the evaporation due to high temperature besides converting some water bodies to agricultural lands and fish farms decreased the overall area of water bodies. Regard with to fish farms, this increase that occurred could be referred to the intensive reclamation of sabkha areas and converting these sabkha to fish farming activities. As for the sabkha, these results could be mainly due to the agricultural expansion and increased urban, which occurred during this period. Concerning with salts, this is due to converting some salts to agricultural lands and, increased urban and increased fish farms. Regarding with sand, this is due to the continuous human activities in the studied area which grow towards reclamation of more agricultural lands and increased urban. These results are in agreement with those obtained by  | Change detection in Nile Delta governorates during the period of 1987 up to 2015: This part monitors the land use/land cover change in the Nile Delta governorates during the study period from  by using change detection analysis, has been done for agriculture, urban, water bodies and sand feature classes through three periods; the first period from 1987 to 2000, the second from 2000 to 2015 and the third period was for the overall period from 1987 to 2015. As for changes in agricultural area, the eleven Nile Delta governorates showed three different patterns. The first pattern included six governorates (Sharkia, Monofiya, Ismailia, Kafr El-Sheikh, El-Behera and Alexandria) where the cultivated area recorded continuous increase from 1987 to 2015. In these governorates, the cultivated area represented 66.0, 72.0 and 74.0% of the total area cultivated in 1987, 2000 and 2015, respectively. The change percent recorded 24.5% and 12.4% for the periods from 1987 to 2000 and 2000 to 2015, respectively (Table 
As for the second human activity, urban sprawl, it is clear that the urban area was increased in all Delta governorates through the overall period of study (Table  | Governorates: Total agriculture area (ha.) Change area (ha.)
area of urban sprawl detected through 1987-2015 was in Port Said represented 129.1 and 370.9%, respectively. However, change percent of urban sprawl followed a same trend in all over Delta governorates in the both studied periods 
Water bodies were increased by 3.2% and 1.9% of the total area in five of eleven detected governorates through 
Finally, sand area was decreased in all Delta governorate (Table  | Governorates: Total area Urban (ha.) Change area (ha.)
highest sand area was detected at El-Behera whereas the smallest area was detected at Gharbia. The change in sand area from 1987 to 2000 was highs compared to other governorates. This may be due mainly to the increase of agricultural land and the reclamation of more land in addition to the increase of urban sprawl. | Conclusion: It could be concluded that satellite data is a good and quick technique to monitor the changes in land use/land cover with low cost comparing to conventional surveying methods. The analysis of the results also showed that most of Egyptian Delta governorates have been significantly affected by the different categories of land cover such as agriculture, urban, water bodies and sand areas. Finally, this study showed that the study area has undergone a very severe land use/land cove change as a result of urban sprawl, the problem that need to be seriously studied, through multidimensional fields including socioeconomic, in order to preserve the precious and limited agricultural land and increase food production. Also, It is recommended that continuous remote sensing images collection, analysis interpretation and updating of images concerning urbanization in the Nile Delta is required to monitor the developments for quick response in decision making by appropriate authorities.","Table 1 Change rate of different land use/land cover classes in the studied area during the period from 1987 to 2015 (, 1987-2000 2000-2015 1987-2015 1987 2000 2015) || Change area (, , 1987 2000 2015 1987-2000 2000-2015 1987-2015 from 1987 to 2015) || Change area (, 1987 2000 2015 1987-2000 2000-2015 1987-2015 from 1987 to 2015) || Image-based atmospheric correction revised and improved (, 1996) || Integration of SPOT-5 and ETM+ images to Detect Land Cover Change in Urban Environment (, , , , , 2005) || Change detection of the coastal zone east of the Nile Delta using remote sensing (, , 2010) || The uncertain future of the Nile Delta (, , , 2016) || Monitoring urban growth and land use change detection with GIS and remote sensing techniques in Dakahliea governorate Egypt (, , 2015) || Monitoring agricultural land degradation in Egypt using MODIS NDVI satellite images (, , , 2014) || Modelling and monitoring land cover change processes in tropical regions (, 1997) ||  (, 1987-2015) || Assessment of urban sprawl impact on the agricultural land in the Nile Delta of Egypt using remote sensing and digital soil map (, 2012) || Agricultural land monitoring in Egypt using NOAA-AVHRR and SPOT vegetation data (, , 2010) || Remote sensing and GIS for mapping and monitoring land cover and land-use changes in the Northwestern coastal zone of Egypt (, , 2007) || Data classification using support vector machine (, , 2009) || Principles and Procedures of Statistics (, , 1980) || The emergence of land change science for global environmental change and sustainability (, , , 2007) || Land use change analysis in the Zhujiang Delta of China using satellite remote sensing, GIS and stochastic modelling (, 2001)"
"The impact of land-use/land cover changes on water balance of the heterogeneous Buzi sub-catchment, Zimbabwe",Abel Chemura; Donald Rwasoka; Onisimo Mutanga; Timothy Dube; Terence Mushore,"The nature of interactions between ecological, physical and hydrological characteristics that determine the effects of land cover change on surface and sub-surface hydrology is not well understood in both natural and disturbed environments. The spatiotemporal dynamics of water fluxes and their relationship with land cover changes between 2009 and 2017 in the headwater Buzi sub-catchment in Zimbabwe is evaluated. To achieve this, land cover dynamics for the area under study were characterised from the 30 m Landsat data, using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm. After the land cover classification, the key water balance components namely; interception, transpiration and evapotranspiration (ET) contributions for each class in 2009 and 2017 were estimated. Image classification of Landsat data achieved good overall accuracies above 80% for the two periods. Results showed that the percentage of the plantation land cover types decreased slightly between 2009 (25.4%) and 2017 (22.5%). Partitioning the annual interception, transpiration and ET according to land cover classes showed that the highest amounts of ET in the basin were from plantation where land cover types with tea had the highest interception, transpiration and ET in the catchment. Higher ET, interception and transpiration were observed in the eastern parts of the catchment. At catchment level, results show that 2017 had a higher water balance than 2009, which was partly explained by the decrease in plantation cover type.","Introduction: Spatial information on water flux within the soil-vegetationatmosphere system is critical for water management at catchment level in the face of anthropogenic surface modifications and global change. Land cover change alters the atmospheric carbon and nitrogen cycles, albedo, runoff, soil water holding capacity and biodiversity among others at local, regional and global scales 
Changes in vegetation cover have significant impacts on the surface water budget, especially for evapotranspiration (ET), an important component of the terrestrial hydrological cycle 
Agricultural and forestry plantations are important economic activities that contribute to local employment and national development. Plantation forests use more water per unit area per year than agricultural land covers such as grains, pasture and other crops, which lowers runoff and discharge in areas that they are dominant 
It is well established in literature that different vegetation types have different ET, and therefore major changes in land cover have consequent effects on ET 
The substantial extent of plantations as a land cover type in some catchments together with the degree to which they reduce runoff and recharge is sufficient to justify the inclusion of plantations in water resource planning, policy and management 
Given the importance of agricultural and forestry plantations as a land cover type in terms of economic importance and provision of environmental service on one hand and catchment hydrology and related water resource management on the other, it is therefore important to understand how land cover change can have an impact on aspects of the water balance in the catchment. We hypothesize that there is a link between land use/cover and water balance such at catchment level that is modified by land cover change. The objectives of this study were therefore to (1) determine the proportion of agricultural and forestry plantations as land use/cover types in Buzi sub-catchment in 2009 and 2017, (2) establish the quantitative and spatial changes in land cover between the time periods and (3) understand the relationship between changes in land cover and water balance in the catchment level. | Materials and methods:  | Study area: The Buzi headwaters sub-catchment is located between latitude 32 ÔøΩ 32 ÔøΩ 0 E and 32 ÔøΩ 52 ÔøΩ 0 E, and longitude 20 ÔøΩ 20 ÔøΩ 0 S and 20 ÔøΩ 08 ÔøΩ 0 S in Chipinge district in Zimbabwe under the Save Catchment (Fig.  | Land cover change assessment:  | Image data acquisition pre-processing: For the land cover classification, two dry season Landsat images for 2009 and 2017 were acquired. The imagery were obtained with georeferencing, which was sufficient for general land cover classification as was required in the study. To ensure consistency in the atmospheric correction, the analysis ready, atmospherically corrected Landsat Surface Reflectance Level 2 science products were ordered from the earth explorer (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov). These were 16-bit signed integer data with radiometric and geometric correction and were converted to surface reflectance with a provided scale factor. The dates, sensor types, cloud cover and other characteristic of the images are in Table 
Image stacks were made of five bands, that is, blue (B), green (G), blue (B), near infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR1) as Seven land cover types formed the classification scheme used to classify the images. These are described in detail in Table  | Image classification algorithm: To classify the four image stacks for 2009 and 2017, we applied the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) approach. Boosting is an ensemble machine learning approach that creates a strong learner from a given number of weak learners. XGBoost is an improved step from the recursive tree-based partitioning method of gradient boosting introduced by  | Classification accuracy assessment: We used the confusion matrix to assess the accuracy of the classification process relative to reference data. The overall accuracy (OA), user's accuracy (UA) and producer's accuracy were determined from the confusion matrix. OA is the percentage that indicates the probability that a pixel is classified correctly by the thematic map. PA for is the percentage of a category on the ground that is correctly classified by the on the map, and measures proportion of pixels omitted from a reference classes (omission error). UA expresses the proportion of a category on the ground that is included erroneously in another category (commission error)  | Linking land cover changes to water balance in the catchment: The land cover types obtained from the classification were linked to the annual water balance parameters for the catchment that were obtained from the FAO Vapor data portal (https://wapor.apps.fao.org/ catalog/1). This was done with the objective of determining the contribtuion of each land cover type to the water flux that are important for catchment boundaly layer processes (Table 
The FAO WaPOR datasets were at a lower resolution that the landsat data and therefore majority (modal) resampling was applied on the classified image to bring them to the same resolution of 250 m of the FAO Wapor data. The resampled classes were converted to points and used to extract the values of the water balance parameters for each land cover class for the two periods. In addition, to determine the relationships between the different land cover types and water flux, we calculated three water related vegetation indices from the Landsat bands that have been identified as direct indicators of leaf water content 
The process of modelling the relationship between land cover types and water flux is summarized in the schematic diagram in Fig.  | Results:  | Image classification results: The XGBoost achieved an overall accuracy of 83.1% for 2009 and 86.6% for 2017 (Table  | Land cover/use types and changes between 2009 and 2017: The thematic maps for the two time periods  | Land use based ET in Buzi sub-catchment: The resampled land cover classes for 2009 and 2017 are shown in Fig. 
Using all the pixels in the catchment, the results showed that the greatest amounts of interception in the sub-catchment occur in the cover class tea and plantation forests, followed by natural forest. As expected, water had the least interception and transpiration but high evapotranspiration (Fig. 
We further determined the correlation between precipitation, interception, transpiration and evapotranspiration losses for all pixels in the catchment, which are shown in Table  | Discussion: In this study, we aimed at understanding how land cover change affect aspects of the water balance at sub-catchment level by linking remote sensing image classification with water flux in a heterogeneous tropical catchment. We have presented a catchment-level water balance assessment using remote sensing derived land cover dynamics for 2009 and 2017, which were linked to interception, transpiration and ET. Finally, the water balance for the two periods was calculated to represent long-term spatio-temporal dynamics of terrestrial variables. | Land cover change assessment: The image classification process determined the spatial and quantitative distribution of the selected land cover classes in the Buzi Headwaters sub catchment as shown by the thematic maps for 2009 and 2017. The accuracies achieved by implementation of the XGBoost algorithm for image classification are satisfactory and comparable to other classification accuracies in similar landscapes. For example, while Chemura and Mutanga (2017) obtained comparable classification using Landsat data, the XGBoost has added advantages that it is fast and produces smaller but more accurate models as it applies the sparsity-aware split-finding approach to more efficiently train the classifier 
A significant part of the Buzi Headwaters have been modified by human activities as human-induced cover types (cropland, plantation forest, coffee, tea and water) now dominate the landscape of the sub basin accounting for 44.6% in 2009 and 46% in 2017. The high agricultural development potential of the Buzi Headwaters sub catchment makes the area to be in high demand for agricultural land uses at the expense of natural cover types. In 2009 a quarter of the catchment      (25.4%) was under plantation cover type which reduced to 22.5% in 2017 but in both years exceeding the recommended maximum threshold of 20% of catchment for plantation cover types 
In addition to changes in area for land cover types, co-occurrences of the plantation cover type was also observed especially for tea and plantation forest. Tea and plantation forest cover types have been shown to be concentrated in certain localities compared to coffee, which was scattered in smallholder plots across the sub-catchment. The close association between tea and plantation forest means that these plantation types will take significant areas in particular parts of the catchment, increasing the impact of plantations on the catchment hydrology and other environmental conditions. 
The growth of plantation forests has also been linked to large-scale government initiated reforestation programs elsewhere  | Land cover change and water balance: Although the plant physiology and management govern negative and positive environmental interactions of plantation land cover types, there  are significant differences between annual crops and plantations. Tree crops alter the water cycle of catchments, as they are likely to increase interception and increase evapotranspiration, which in both cases reduces runoff 
This study has demonstrated that ET sources shift in a catchment with land cover changes, with this also altering the water flux in the catchment. From a catchment management perspective, it shown which areas need focus in term of reducing ET from the catchment in order to maximize water yield and discharge. Thus, depending on the type of changes in land cover at catchment scale, water flux parameters respond accordingly and it is possible to achieve both positive and negative effects on water balance. As such, the suggestion by 
It is also important to note that the effects of the changes in land cover may be beyond quantitative water flux but may also include water quality changes and resultant impacts on ecosystems and economic activities  | Implications on catchment scale water resources management: The issue of plantations and water resources requires an understanding of several areas of hydrology because forest vegetation cover influences several aspects of water balance in landscapes. This is even more urgent in transboundary basins where activities in one sub-basin have spill over effects in other basins and other countries. According Lagerblad (2010) irrigation is the largest water user in the basin, taking up to 4% of the flows. The expected urban and agricultural development in the Upper Buzi catchment due to population growth and the land reform program respectively are expected to lead to increased demand on water resources in the Buzi basin in eastern Zimbabwe, both for urban water supply and irrigated agriculture  | Conclusions: In this study, we connected land cover changes from satellite remote sensing data to water flux variables data at catchment level to understand the contribution of land cover change to water flux for a tropical catchment. Our approach presents a remote sensing based approach for evaluating and tracking the effect of land use/cover change on water balance that is related to many ecosystem processes. We observed that there were changes in land use/cover in Buzi sub-catchment from 2009 to 2017 with major changes related to human dominated activities such as settlements and croplands with decreases in grasslands. From the results of this study, we conclude that increase in areas under agricultural plantations could threaten water yield as these land cover types increase ET with decreases in their areas being good for positive catchment water balance. We also found that spatial distribution and rearrangement of plantations within a catchment is an important factor in water balance, as they are some plantations types co-occur and thus are concentrated in specific parts of the catchment. It was noted that plantation cover types are significant in influencing water flux in Buzi subcatchments that they are significant and water balance changing with land use change. From our findings, we recommend that regular monitoring of development of plantations is important at catchment level given their contribution to water dynamics vis-vis decreasing water availability die to climate change and competing uses. The insights from this study are imperative for catchment managers for related or similar catchments with plantations cover types in terms of understanding, and projecting impacts from land cover change on water resources for integrated catchment management.","Evapotranspiration of annual and perennial biofuel crops in a variable climate (, , , , , , , 2015) || Effects of dynamic land use/land cover change on water resources and sediment yield in the Anzali wetland catchment (, , , , , , , 2020) || A remote sensing surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL). 1 (, , , , 1998) || Land use and land cover dynamics and drivers in the Muga watershed (, , 2019) || Trends and drivers of land use/land cover change in Western Ethiopia (, , , , 2019) || The land surfaceatmosphere interaction: a review based on observational and global modeling perspectives (, , , , , 1996) || Development of catchment research, with particular attention to Plynlimon and its forerunner, the East African catchments (, , 2007) || A review of catchment experiments to determine the effect of vegetation changes on water yield and evapotranspiration (, , 1982) || Modelling impacts of land cover change on critical water resources in the Motueka River catchment (, , , , 2009) || Developing detailed age-specific thematic maps for coffee (Coffea arabica L.) in heterogeneous agricultural landscapes using random forests applied on Landsat 8 multispectral sensor (, , 2017) || Xgboost: a scalable tree boosting system (, , 2016) ||  (, , , , 2019) || A review of assessing the accuracy of classifications of remotely sensed data (, 1991) || Assessing human and environmental pressures of global land-use change 2000-2010 (, , , , , , , 2019) || Quantifying the relative importance of direct and indirect biophysical effects of deforestation on surface temperature and teleconnections (, , , , 2018) || Satellite-based, multi-indices for evaluation of agricultural droughts in a highly dynamic tropical catchment (, , , , 2018) || Biophysics and vegetation cover change: a process-based evaluation framework for confronting land surface models with satellite observations (, , , , , , , 2018) || The mark of vegetation change on Earth's surface energy balance (, , , 2018) || The effect of land cover type and structure on evapotranspiration from agricultural and wetland sites in the Sacramento (, , , , , , , 2018) || Effects of afforestation on water yield: a global synthesis with implications for policy (, , , 2005) || Status of land cover classification accuracy assessment (, 2002) || Greedy function approximation: a gradient boosting machine (, 2001) || The climate hazards infrared precipitation with stations-a new environmental record for monitoring extremes (, , , , , , , 2015) || Climate, forest growing season, and evapotranspiration changes in the central Appalachian Mountains (, , , , , , 2019) || Forest cover change over four decades in the Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia: comparison of three watersheds (, , , , 2014) || Human modification of global water vapor flows from the land surface (, , , , , , 2005) || Effect of landcover/ land-use changes on water availability in and around Ruti Dam in Nyazvidzi catchment (, , , , , 2018) || Crude oil price forecasting using XGBoost (, , 2017) || Evapotranspiration is resilient in the face of land cover and climate change in a humid temperate catchment (, , , , , 2018) || Spatio-temporal variation of potential evapotranspiration and climatic drivers in the Jing-Jin-Ji region (, , , , , , , 2018) || Effects of different land use types on potential evapotranspiration in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, North China (, , , , , , , 2019) || Climate change, vegetation dynamics, and the landscape water balance (, , 2007) || Dominant effect of increasing forest biomass on evapotranspiration: interpretations of movement in Budyko space (, , , , , , , 2018) || Exploring the linkages between river water chemistry and watershed characteristics using GIS-based catchment and locality analyses (, , , 2002) || Impact of land-use change on the water resources of the Upper Kharun Catchment (, , , , , 2017) || Assessment of Environmental Flow Requirements (, 2010) || Impacts of land-cover change on the water flow regulation ecosystem service: invasive alien plants, fire and their policy implications.

"Investigating impact of land-use and land cover changes on hydro-ecological balance using GIS: insights from IIT Bombay, India",Aman Srivastava; Pennan Chinnasamy,"The present study, for the first time, examined land-use land cover (LULC), changes using GIS, between 2000 and 2018 for the IIT Bombay campus, India. Objective was to evaluate hydro-ecological balance inside campus by determining spatio-temporal disparity between hydrological parameters (rainfall-runoff processes), ecological components (forest, vegetation, lake, barren land), and anthropogenic stressors (urbanization and encroachments). High-resolution satellite imageries were generated for the campus using Google Earth Pro, by manual supervised classification method. Rainfall patterns were studied using secondary data sources, and surface runoff was estimated using SCS-CN method. Additionally, reconnaissance surveys, ground-truthing, and qualitative investigations were conducted to validate LULC changes and hydro-ecological stability. LULC of 2018 showed forest, having an area cover of 52%, as the most dominating land use followed by built-up (43%). Results indicated that the area under built-up increased by 40% and playground by 7%. Despite rapid construction activities, forest cover and Powai lake remained unaffected. This anomaly was attributed to the drastically declining barren land area (up to ~ 98%) encompassing additional construction activities. Sustainability of the campus was demonstrated with appropriate measures undertaken to mitigate negative consequences of unwarranted floods owing to the rise of 6% in the forest cover and a decline of 21% in water hyacinth cover over Powai lake. Due to this, surface runoff (~ 61% of the rainfall) was observed approximately consistent and being managed appropriately despite major alterations in the LULC. Study concluded that systematic campus design with effective implementation of green initiatives can maintain a hydro-ecological balance without distressing the environmental services.","Introduction: India represents the third-largest higher education system in the world next to China and the USA 
The information on LULC in the form of statistical data and maps is an essential requirement for better utilization of land, spatial planning, and management 
Open-source digital platforms, such as Google Earth Pro, is commonly used for analyzing Earth observation data on land transformations. Google Earth Pro, released in 2004 (initially named as Earth Viewer 3D) by Keyhole Inc., a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) funded company acquired by Google, is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) tool. Based on satellite imagery, it provides a three-dimensional model of the Earth and two-dimensional geographical information via maps. The key feature of Google Earth Pro is that it provides a free high-resolution imagery database from different satellite platforms, such as CNES Airbus, Landsat, and Copernicus 
Several previous studies have extensively used Google Earth Pro for investigating and analyzing natural resources, hydrological balance, ecological stability, LULC changes, navigation, agricultural watersheds, geosciences, and archeological findings from across the globe 
Generating LULC classes using a manual supervised classification technique is yet another approach adopted in land transformation studies 
The number of universities is increasing and expanding in terms of land area to accommodate the increasing number of students by constructing a greater number of hostels in an academic institution. Therefore, understanding and quantifying the spatio-temporal dynamics of the institution's LULC changes and its driving factors are crucial to put forward the right policies and monitoring mechanisms for planners and policymakers  | Study objectives: Dunbar and Acreman 
The aforementioned objectives require good quality and quantity of observation data. For example, good quality and quantity of rainfall data were acquired from the Regional Meteorological Center (RMC), located in Mumbai for the present study site; however, obtaining such data for other parameters, such as vegetation, forest cover, was challenging. In such instances, when observation data are limited, the use of RS data and GIS has been widely used to address data gaps. This paper presents an integrated study using secondary data, RS, GIS, and field observations for the IITB campus. | Methods:  | Study site: The IITB campus is located in the financial and commercial capital of India-Mumbai, between the Powai lake and Vihar lake region, at a geographical location between 19¬∞8‚Ä≤01.09‚Ä≥N and 72¬∞54‚Ä≤55.29‚Ä≥E (Fig.  | Data collection and data processing: The data acquisition of the present research was based both on quantitative (secondary data-based) and qualitative (survey-based) research methods aiming to investigate LULC changes in the campus of IITB between 2000 and 2018. An open-source GIS platform-QGIS and satellite data from Google Earth Pro-was employed for developing LULC maps. Besides this, rainfall data and curve number data were also collected from secondary sources for estimating surface runoff and further analysis of the rainfall-runoff process. | Rainfall (P): The rainfall data (P), from 2000 to 2018, for the Santacruz region of Mumbai were collected from the RMC, Mumbai region  | Remote sensing (RS) using Google Earth Pro: Considering the advantages of the manual classification of the high-resolution satellite imagery for a fine-scale study area, Google Earth Pro is used. The RS data were collected by developing a boundary map of the IITB campus by digitizing it in Google Earth Pro (as shown in insets of Fig. 
Due to the undulating topography of the study area, ground reference data were collected from Google Earth Pro with Ground Control Points (GCPs). As the total study area was small (~ 4.6 km 2 ), each LULC type was groundtruthed using the reconnaissance survey for accuracy assessment. The GCPs for thematic accuracy were collected near the boundary between different LULC classes, whereas GCPs for position accuracy were taken on easily recognizable elements in the satellite images, such as playground corners, building (built-up) edges, bank of Powai lake, and nursey corners. The OSMTracker (online Global Positioning System App) was used to validate the geographical locations. The accuracies of classification were observed better than expected. A negligible error was recorded in the overall accuracy of the classification image for the year 2018, wherein an overall accuracy ranging between 90 and 96% was obtained. Finally, based on these land-use classifications, a Google Earth KML file was obtained for each LULC type. | QGIS processing: The KML files, obtained from Google Earth Pro, were postprocessed in QGIS to estimate the area. The steps included, (1) exporting the KML file to QGIS; (2) converting the KML file into shapefile; (3) generating a LULC image of the IITB campus by defining its boundary (legends) and by assigning different colors for different land uses. Six major LULC classifications were found in the ground survey, which was used for the RS imagery. Following these, LULC maps were generated for the years  | Soil conservation services-curve number (SCS-CN): The SCS-CN method, as developed by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Soil Conservation Service (SCS), primarily aimed at estimating rainfall excesses from rainfall  | Runoff (R) and weighted curve number (WCN) estimations: Using the rainfall (P), area of each land cover type (A), and runoff curve number (CN) estimations, as described in Sects. 2.2, the runoff volume (R) was calculated as the product of P, A, and, CN. The WCN was calculated to determine the overall impact of different land uses over rainfallrunoff behavior inside the campus. For this, the total runoff volume (R 1,t + R 2,t + R 3,t + R 4,t ) from the major four land-use classifications viz., (1) built-up, (2) forest, (3) playground, and (4) barren land were considered, as they were primarily resulting into surface runoff. The R was calculated for each year (t) and divided with the corresponding annual rainfall (P t ) received in that particular year (t). With this, the value of WCN for all the mentioned years in the given study period was obtained. | Qualitative and field investigations: The primary data were used in this study for understanding the nuances of the secondary data, given the behavior of rainfall-runoff components and associated measures being taken to manage the campus development initiatives. The purpose of bringing qualitative investigations in this study was to acquire field insights and understanding people's perception of the changing rainfall-runoff behavior. Key qualitative findings were included in the present study based on personal communication with the residents of the IITB campus (Achary and Yughabala, personal communication, March 9, 2020). Field investigations were conducted inside the campus, which included transect walks at the periphery of the Powai lake and reconnaissance survey, thereby creating social and resource maps indicating diverse land uses. The investigation primarily ground-truthed two facets viz., (1) ascertaining the socio-economic patterns impacting and regulating provisions for groundwater percolation (from green cover) and surface runoff (from built-up cover) and (2) understanding the distinctions of green cover in terms of vegetation, forest cover, and barren land with infrastructural development. | Results:  | Rainfall-runoff analysis: The average annual rainfall in the study period was recorded to be 2,331 mm, with a maximum rainfall observed in the year 2011 (3,129 mm) and the least rainfall received in the year 2015 (1,800 mm) (Fig.  | Qualitative analysis on LULC changes: The LULC maps for the years  | Quantitative analysis of LULC trends: The changes in LULC for playground, built-up, forest, and barren land between 2000 and 2018 are summarized in Fig.  | Water hyacinth cover and its impact over the Powai lake: The analysis of Powai lake, having an area of about 2.34 km 2 , was based on the visible area under satellite imagery for water cover (lake) and the WH cover between 2000 and 2018 (Fig.  | Comparative analysis between LULC for 2000 and 2018:  | Runoff versus built-up change: To understand the rainfall-runoff behavior of the entire campus, the value of WCN was calculated and compared with the built-up cover of the IITB campus. The depth of the runoff (in mm) was used in the estimation of the WCN based on the magnitude of the rainfall (in mm) received each year. The value of WCN was observed fluctuating in the range of 36 to 40 (averaging 39) with an overall decreasing trend across the study period (Fig.  | Discussions:  | Status and plans of infrastructure development post-2018: The rapid expansion in student numbers resulted in an increase in infrastructure activities within the campus. The population of students increased from about 5500 in 2008 to nearly 11,000 in 2020 (Fig. 
To accommodate all the students and staff, additional buildings were needed. The institute planned to construct new hostels by targeting to bring more than 2,000 additional rooms for non-married students and 400 rooms for married students by the year 2022  | Key observations from field investigation: Given the context of minimizing flash flood events together with enhancing green cover amidst rapid infrastructural development, field investigation and qualitative surveys were conducted inside the IITB campus. Findings from the investigation revealed that the construction of any building was preceded by surveying the total vegetation and tree losses that could occur after the construction. Such losses of greenery were more or less compensated by additional plantation of the trees either in the vicinity of the constructed building or in the nearby gardens (Fig.  | Status and recommendations for sustainable campus development: The fact claimed by the website of IITB -""‚Ä¶the campus' green cover has been maintained and even increased over the years"" 
Besides student-run bodies, institute-level committees were formed to address the prevailing issues focusing on the implications of the rainfall-runoff behavior, and impacts of the rapid built-up growth on campus ecology. This included the Green Campus Initiative (GCI) committee established in 2010  | Learnings from past studies: There are yet studies that focused on spatio-temporal variation of landscape patterns, wherein they considered complex interactions of social, economic, demographic, technological, political, biophysical, and cultural factors, for example Behera et al.  | Future scopes: The developing campuses are more vulnerable to rapid LULC changes, in case, not enough consideration is given in devising sustainable strategies for overall holistic campus development. Based on the results and discussions, this study proposes to focus on the following attributes in future investigations for the IITB campus:
‚Ä¢ In order to develop a green model, holistic approaches are further needed to improving sectors like solid waste management (to eradicate landfills), wastewater management (to reduce water hyacinth cover in Powai lake; invading as a result of the discharge of the wastewater), smarter and greener buildings (to install rainwater harvesting coupled with roof-top plantation making maximum utilization of rainfall and minimizing runoff ), etc. Similar initiatives with characteristics like lower carbon footprint 
‚Ä¢ Since the land-use classes are generated by the manual classification method, the accuracy associated with the satellite imagery cannot be assessed using the Kappa coefficient and user's and producer's accuracies of individual classes. Future research should consider applying supervised classification for image processing and interpretation that can better differentiate between vegetation cover, barren land, and the forest (cover) leaves. A maximum-likelihood algorithm could be employed to detect the land-use classifications. The primary three geoprocessing tools, viz., create accuracy assessment points, update accuracy assessment points, and compute confusion matrix, can be employed to generate an accuracy assessment report.  | Summary and conclusions: The present study, for the first time, examined the changes in the land-use land cover (LULC) pattern of the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) campus from the period of 2000 to 2018 using remote sensing data and Geographical Information System. Parameters, such as greenery (vegetation and forest), water hyacinth (WH) cover in Powai lake, and other land uses and their impacts over the rainfall-runoff process, were studied and analyzed. The analysis was based on the simplified mass balance algorithms that can be used by land managers with less training efforts. Results indicated that the LULC change was major in the case of built-up, barren land, Powai lake, and the WH cover, while the LULC change observed was minor in the case of the forest cover and playground. The infrastructural development (built-up), including academic building, hostels, and roads, drastically increased in the study period, and the expansion of the built-up cover, in terms of the area, mostly happened through available barren land without interfering with the forest cover. The overall WH cover decreased significantly from 0.9 km 2 in 2000 to 0.4 km 2 in 2018 in the Powai lake, due to the aesthetics aspect of Hiranandani settlements, but the WH on the IITB's side was not much improved since 2000. Hiranandani was a tourist place, and thus, to maintain its tourism, the Powai lake at this zone was substantially maintained, which gradually reduced the WH cover to null in the year 2018, thereby bringing back the lake to its initial coverage. The number of trees on the campus of IITB recorded a fluctuating increase, thus improving the green cover on the campus. As a result, a fluctuating slighter decrease in runoff volume to Powai lake was observed despite the rapid rise in the built-up area. This happened because of the increase in the number of trees in the gardens of all buildings and along both sides of the major and minor roads including the surrounding area of the Powai lake. The various student-run social and technical bodies along with administrative and institute committees of IITB have taken appropriate measures to maintain the green cover within the campus, which resulted in keeping the check over high runoff discharge. This paper further summarized how the infrastructural development in IITB has changed the LULC pattern and documented the potential impacts of the same on the green cover, runoff patterns and hydrological balance inside the campus. Lessons learned from substantial LULC change assessments can lead to sustainable design for eco-friendly LULC which could be an alternative for any campus. Based on the major findings from the present study, the following conclusions were drawn:
‚Ä¢ The IITB campus and its surrounding region witnessed more rainfall than the average annual rainfall of Mumbai. It was observed during field observation and remote sensing studies that the forest (green) cover was the most dominating land use inside campus, coupled with the presence of the national park in the campus vicinity. It can be concluded that the green cover caused higher rainfall in the region. Therefore, careful management strategies, through the lens of green campus initiatives, for controlling events of flash flood amidst new constructions become obligatory. ‚Ä¢ Removal of the water hyacinth from Powai lake, though appeared challenging, was achievable given the fact that the Hiranandani complex was able to clear it to a considerable extent. Therefore, the maintenance aspects of the lake not only needed higher prioritization but also needed the participatory-based involvement of diverse stakeholders.
‚Ä¢ Despite rapid construction activities, the events of flash floods (due to higher runoff ) within the campus remained dormant. Apart from appropriate water routing and discharging surplus runoff into Powai lake, it was concluded that the forest cover, or more specifically the greater density of the trees, caused higher infiltration of the rain against surface runoff. ‚Ä¢ The evidence that the weighted curve number unevenly declined across the study period against the increasing built-up cover concluded that the systematic campus design, with effective implementation of the green initiatives, can maintain hydro-ecological balance without compromising with the environmental services.
‚Ä¢ The study finally concluded that the limited land availability for future constructions must be coupled with exploring appropriate strategies for sustainable and eco-friendly constructions, given the threat to the green cover. Green technologies, such as roof-top plantation and green building conceptions, could be employed for creating additional green spaces inside the campus.","Development of land-use/land-cover maps using Landsat-8 and MODIS Data, and their integration for hydro-ecological applications (, , , , , , 2019. 1922) || Harvesting river water through small dams promote positive environmental impact (, , , , 2016) || LULC analysis of urban spaces using Markov chain predictive model at Ranchi in India (, , , 2017) || Modelling and analyzing the watershed dynamics using Cellular Automata (CA)-Markov model-A geo-information based approach (, , , , , 2012) || Remote sensing based deforestation analysis in Mahanadi and Brahmaputra river basin in India since 1985 (, , , , , , , , , , , 2018) || A review of the USDA SCS curve number method (, 1989) || Size-constrained region merging (SCRM) (, , , 2008) || Higher education in India-issues, challenges and suggestions (, 2020) || Google Earth imageries for validating groundwater recharge zone in basaltic region (, , , , , , , 2020) || Stream and shallow groundwater nutrient concentrations in an Ozark forested riparian zone of the central USA (, , 2015) || Remote sensing-based assessment of coastal regulation zones in India: a case study of Mumbai (, , 2020) || Evaluating the effectiveness of water infrastructures for increasing groundwater recharge and agricultural production -A case study of Gujarat (, , , , , 2015) || Impact of 2018 Kerala floods on soil erosion: need for post-disaster soil management (, , , 2020) || Economic growth in India: the role of physical and social infrastructure (, , 2010) || Applied hydro-ecological science for the twenty-first century (, , 2001.

Mapping the spatial heterogeneity of global land use and land cover from 2020 to 2100 at a 1 km resolution,Tianyuan Zhang; Changxiu Cheng; Xudong Wu,"A fine global future land use/land cover (LULC) is critical for demonstrating the geographic heterogeneity of earth system dynamics and human-earth interaction. In this study, we produced a 1 km global future LULC dataset that takes into account future climate and socio-economic changes as well as the impact of simulated results of the former year on temporally adjacent periods. By incorporating the variations in climatic and socio-economic factors, we differentiated LULC suitability probabilities for historical and future periods across representative SSP-RCP scenarios. then, by using an improved cellular automata model-PLUS to simulate the patch-level changes of various land classes, we iteratively downscaled water-basin-level LULC demands in various future scenarios to a spatial resolution of 1 km. Our dataset achieves a high degree of simulation accuracy (Kappa = 0.94, OA = 0.97, FoM = 0.10) and precisely captures the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of global LULC changes under the combined effects of climate change and socio-economic development. This robust and fine-scale LULC dataset provides valuable spatially-explicit information essential for earth system modeling and intricate dynamics between anthropogenic activities and the environment.","Background & Summary: Land use and land cover (LULC) change reflects the intricate interaction between climate change and intensive human activities 
Early LULC projections mostly forecast global land use demands at subregional levels, which are generally obtained from integrated assessment models (IAMs) such as AIM (Asia-Pacific integrated model), modular applied general equilibrium tool (MAGNET), Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment (IMAGE), and Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM). For instance, AIM simulates future regional land use dynamics by categorizing the world into 17 geopolitical regions 
Cellular automata (CA) have proved to be efficient in allocating land use to more spatially-explicit details, which are capable of defining the rules of cell-to-cell transformation as well as their adaptive behaviors and thus simulating the complex geospatial patterns. By integrating with land use demands generated from IAMs, CA models are capable of simulating scenario-based gridded LULC datasets with a finer resolution (normally 1 km). For instance, Li et al. 
Moreover, existing practices of future land use allocation generally utilize historical baseline to simulate land use dynamics under representative SSP-RCP scenarios, overlooking the effects of the simulated results of the former year on subsequent ones 
This study aims to produce a gridded dataset of global LULC at 1 km √ó 1 km resolution under typical SSP-RCP scenarios from 2020 to 2100 by combining the Patch-generating Land Use Simulation (PLUS) model and GCAM. Firstly, we use GCAM to simulate global land use demand at the water-basin level and calibrate urban land use generated from GCAM by means of a multivariate regression method. Compared to other IAM models such as IMAGE and AIM, GCAM has its advantages in simulating the spatial heterogeneity of global LULC with a classification of 235 regions at the water-basin level, by taking into account the discrepant land cover patterns in different agro-ecological zones and diversified socio-economic levels of different geopolitical regions. Secondly, by using the PLUS model to simulate the patch-level changes of various land classes driven by future suitability probabilities, we allocate the regional land use demand in various future scenarios to a spatial resolution of 1 km √ó 1 km. Finally, we compare the gridded dataset for future LULC with existing land use products to validate the accuracy of the results. This new dataset guarantees consistency across different SSP-RCP scenarios at explicit spatial details. Moreover, compared to other LULC products for future periods, this gridded dataset fully incorporates the impact of simulated results on temporally adjacent simulations and enhances the fidelity by using future suitability probabilities for land use projection. The outcome of this study can greatly help improve the accuracy of simulating earth system dynamics and modeling human-earth interaction. | Methods: Overall framework. Figure  | Projection of LULC demand.: GCAM is an open-source, multi-sector coordinated IAM developed by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), which gains wide applications in modeling agriculture and land use  | Downscaling of LULC demand on a water-basin scale. Spatially explicit LULC simulation models: provide a means to convey changes from macro to local scales 
The baseline LULC data, driving factor data, and restriction zone data used in the simulations are described as shown in Table  | Data Records: The dataset generated in this study is on a global scale with a resolution of 1 km and encompasses a timespan from 2020 to 2100, which is publicly available on https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.23542860 
We also calculated Pearson correlation coefficients to further assess the spatial conformity between the simulated results and historical LULC data in 2020, considering both overall and subtype-specific LULC distributions (refer to Table 
Moreover, Figure  | Suitability probability generated by driving factors for future periods.: In the simulation stage for future periods, we found that the LULC simulation derived from future suitability probability can effectively capture the influence of driving factors on LULC change. Using the forest in Southern Africa as a case, Figure 
Our analysis revealed that the future suitability probability has evolved from its historical counterpart due to the influence of future driving factors. Regions with lower suitability probabilities in the historical probability landscape (shown in blue in Figure 
We further examined the distribution of the driving factors that lead to the difference between historical and future suitability probability. Historically, the GDP level displayed noticeable national differences. Given Angola's higher historical economic level in comparison to Zambia (see Figure  | Variations in global LULC changes across different SSP-rCP scenarios. The discrepancy in LULC: under various SSP-RCP scenarios is well reflected in the dataset produced in this study. By taking Southeast Asia as an example, Figure 
To illustrate the variations in grassland areas across different future scenarios, we concentrate our focus on the Tibetan Plateau, a representative steppe region (see Figure 
Along with this environmental shift, intensive animal husbandry is forecasted to persist in this region, which is characterized by a growing population with an unabated demand for animal products and feed. This interplay of socio-economic and environmental factors contributes to relative stability in grassland area extent, forestalling any drastic reductions.
Comparison with other LULC datasets. We compared the gridded dataset generated in this study to LUH2 
Selecting regions with comprehensive LULC types in China (FoM = 0.12), Africa (FoM = 0.08), and the United States (FoM = 0.11) as examples, we validated the simulation accuracy by comparing our simulation results (see Figure 
Figure 
into 32 regions for the downscaling process, we divided the world into 235 regions at the water-basin level. This approach provides a better representation of the spatial heterogeneity in LULC simulations, and facilitates more precise control over the allocation of LULC demand within each water basin. Secondly, we adopted an iterative simulation technique starting with the historical data from 2020 as the basis for modeling the LULC of the subsequent future period, which was then used as the foundation for the simulation of the next period. This iterative approach considers the spatial impact of previous LULC results on the simulation of subsequent periods. By limiting the spatial and temporal scope of the simulation, we were able to control the number of pixels undergoing changes within each water basin. These abovementioned strategies help prevent the uncontrollable expansion of changing pixels within larger regions over extended simulation periods, and thus avoid the aggregation of changing pixels in areas with high suitability probability (refer to Figure  | Usage Notes: This study produced a global-scale LULC dataset that includes 6 LULC types with a 1 km resolution from 2020 to 2100 under different SSP-RCP scenarios. The dataset displays robust simulation accuracy across world regions at the water-basin level (FoM = 0.10, Kappa coefficient = 0.94, OA = 0.97), which can efficiently capture the differential impacts exerted by each SSP-RCP scenario on the future expansion of LULC. This LULC dataset is fully supportive for mapping the geospatial heterogeneity of future land use and can provide spatially-explicit data for simulating earth system dynamics and anthropogenic impacts on the environment.
Compared with existing global LULC datasets for future periods, our dataset gave full account to the variation in future suitability probability relative to its historical counterpart, and employed future driving factors to derive updated suitability probability for LULC expansion across different SSP-RCP scenarios. Moreover, we used the PLUS model, a CA model that is capable of modeling the expansion of multiple types of natural LULC Fig. 
Yet, this dataset still has some limitations. Compared with the natural LULC types, the correlation coefficient between the simulation results and the observed data for urban areas is relatively lower (see Table ","Spatiotemporal patterns and characteristics of land-use change in China during 2010-2015 (, 2018) || Land use/land cover change and the effects on ecosystem services in the Hengduan Mountain region (, , , , 2018) || Global land change from 1982 to 2016 (, 2018) || Measuring the sustainable development implications of climate change mitigation (, 2020) || The MAGNET model: Module description (, 2014) || Scenarios of land use and land cover change in the conterminous United States: Utilizing the special report on emission scenarios at ecoregional scales (, 2012) || Land use representation in a global CGE model for long-term simulation: CET vs. logit functions (, , , , 2014) || Harmonization of land-use scenarios for the period 1500-2100: 600 years of global gridded annual land-use transitions, wood harvest, and resulting secondary lands (, 2011) || Harmonization of global land use change and management for the period 850-2100 (LUH2) for CMIP6 (, 2020) || Global land use for 2015-2100 at 0.05¬∞ resolution under diverse socioeconomic and climate scenarios (, 2020) || Downscaling land use and land cover from the Global Change Assessment Model for coupling with Earth system models (, , , , , 2016) || Exploring SSP land-use dynamics using the IMAGE model: Regional and gridded scenarios of land-use change and land-based climate change mitigation (, 2018) || Gridded emissions and land-use data for 2005-2100 under diverse socioeconomic and climate mitigation scenarios (, , , , , 2018) || Global land-use allocation model linked to an integrated assessment model (, , , , , 2017) || A New Global Land-Use and Land-Cover Change Product at a 1-km Resolution for 2010 to 2100 Based on Human-Environment Interactions (, 2017) || Global projections of future urban land expansion under shared socioeconomic pathways (, 2020) || Future Land Use/Land Cover Change Has Nontrivial and Potentially Dominant Impact on Global Gross Primary Productivity (, 2022) || Global land projection based on plant functional types with a 1-km resolution under socio-climatic scenarios (, , , 2022) || Spatial Sequential Modeling and Predication of Global Land Use and Land Cover Changes by Integrating a Global Change Assessment Model and Cellular Automata (, 2019) || Cell-level coupling of a mechanistic model to cellular automata for improving land simulation (, , , 2023) || CMIP6 Earth System Models Project Greater Acceleration of Climate Zone Change Due To Stronger Warming (, , , , 2023) || Present and future K√∂ppen-Geiger climate classification maps at 1-km resolution (, 2018) || Evaluating the economic impact of water scarcity in a changing world (, 2021) || Global Energy and CO 2 to the Year 2050 (, , 1983) || Can updated climate pledges limit warming well below 2 ¬∞C?

"Detecting and Analyzing Land Use and Land Cover Changes in the Region of Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar, Libya Using Time-Series Landsat Data from 1985 to 2017",Jamal Alawamy; Siva Balasundram; Ahmad Husni; Mohd Hanif; Christopher Boon,"The region of Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar in northeastern Libya has undergone rapid, wide-ranging changes in the land use and land cover (LULC) intensified by the conversion of natural resources for food purpose, urbanization, and other socioeconomic benefits. This study examined the use of geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing techniques to gain a quantitative understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of LULC. In addition, the major factors behind LULC changes and decline of natural vegetation in the region were analyzed. A post-classification comparison approach was used to detect LULC changes in the study area between 1985 and 2017 using four Landsat images from 1985, 2000, 2010, and 2017. The observed changes were indicative of a decrease in the expanse of the natural Mediterranean forest which lost 9018 ha over 32 years, 39% of its total area, with the highest deforestation rate registered between 2010 and 2017 estimated at 513 ha. year -1 . Orchards and rain-fed agriculture lands gained 4095 ha, which matches 55% of initial area, whereas the land under irrigated crops increased by 2266 ha, about 85% of the original area. The area of urban and built-up land in 2017 was more than double in 1985 and achieved the highest urbanization rate between 2010 and 2017 at 203 ha.year -1 . Results indicate an unstable trend of bare and low vegetation lands which generally increased by about 50%. From the outcomes of this research, it is strongly recommended that urgent measures be taken to conserve the natural forest and to achieve a rational use of agricultural land in the region of Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar.","Introduction: Many countries in the world are faced with rapid, wide-ranging changes in land use (e.g., human activities and various utilization of the land) and land cover (e.g., physical characteristics of the land surface) 
Globally, land use change through the conversion of the world's forest land to other uses continues on an increasing scale due to the unprecedented growth of the human population which increases the demand for food and land 
In Libya, LULC changes have been intensified by the conversion of natural resources for food purpose and other socioeconomic benefits which have increased land exploitation and conversion by humans both on spatial and temporal scales 
Land cover classification is one of the most important remote sensing applications in the interests of identifying features such as land use by employing commonly multispectral satellite imagery 
In Libya, LULC change continues without a national monitoring program  | Materials and Methods:  | Study Area: Libya lies along the southern side of the Mediterranean coast, approximately between the latitudes of 19 ‚Ä¢ 30 N and 33 ‚Ä¢ 10 N and the longitudes of 09 ‚Ä¢ 30 E and 25 ‚Ä¢ 00 E. Libya is mostly a desert country with a dry climate and a rare vegetation cover. However, the region of Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar in the northeastern part is an exception with a relatively high annual rainfall (250-650 mm) combining intense farming areas, natural forests, and shrubs. This region is the most favored part of the country from the climatic aspect with human settlements and land use dating back to the classical period and where agricultural activities are concentrated and expanding until today. As shown in Figure  | Data Collection: Satellite imagery and ancillary data were used for investigating the historical changes of LULC in the study area over 32 years from 1985 to 2017. Four Landsat satellite scenes for Path/Row 183/37 from three types of sensors were downloaded from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/). Table 
The dates of imagery were defined based on events that had considerable impacts in expanding deforestation activities and LULC changes in Libya. The image of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) This work was carried out in an area covering the middle northern part the of Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar region between the latitudes of 32 ‚Ä¢ 42'N and 32 ‚Ä¢ 56'N and the longitudes of 21 ‚Ä¢ 30 and 21 ‚Ä¢ 50 E (Figure  | Data Collection: Satellite imagery and ancillary data were used for investigating the historical changes of LULC in the study area over 32 years from 1985 to 2017.

The dates of imagery were defined based on events that had considerable impacts in expanding deforestation activities and LULC changes in Libya. The image of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) captured in 1985 was used to represent the status before the first abolishment of the Ministry of Agriculture in 1986. Unfortunately, we could not get a usable image from the same year. The Landsat 7 Enhanced Thermal Mapper Plus (ETM+) image of 2000 was captured in May, about two months after the second abolishment of the Ministry of Agriculture, and thus was selected to picture the LULC status at the beginning of the second period. The popular uprising in Libya which started on 17 February 2011, was an important event, after which the whole country experienced dramatic changes in many political, economic, and social aspects that significantly contributed to LULC change; therefore, the Landsat 7 ETM+ image acquired on 5 September 2010, just five months before this event, was used as a reference for the beginning of the third period.
Ancillary data comprised a collection of Ground Control Points (GCP) and a combination of digital and paper maps covering the study area including a series of topographic maps at scale (1:50,000) and land use and land cover maps of 2005. In addition, aerial photographs covering a part of the study area taken on 30 May 1979, with a scale of 1:6000, were obtained and used for identification of areas subjected to LULC change. Ground truthing points were collected using a hand-held Geographical Positioning System (GPS) through field visits organized in 2016 during the same season in which satellite images were acquired. Points were separated into two groups, one for training samples used in the classification stage and another for test samples for classification accuracy assessment. | Image Processing and Analysis: Image data were treated using ENVI 5.3 and Arc-GIS 10.3 software packages. The data processing steps are given in Figure

The data processing steps are given in Figure  | Satellite Image Preprocessing: Comparative analysis using different Landsat data (i.e., TM, ETM+, and OLI (Operational Land Imager)) can be challenging due to the instrumental errors related to ache sensor, noise from several sources, and uncertainty in scale and geometric conditions 
To reduce radiometric errors, images were calibrated using the radiometric correction tool in ENVI 5.3, where raw data from the sensors (DNs) were converted to top-of-atmosphere reflectance. For atmospheric correction, a dark object subtraction model was applied in the current study as it is relatively the simplest and most widely used empirical method for classification and change detection applications 
The imageries were projected to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system, Datum LGD2006, zone 34 North and corrected for geometric errors from the sources. Image-to-map rectification method was applied to geometrically correct the Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS (Operational Land Imager and Thermal Infrared Sensor) satellite image dated 11 May 2017 using well-distributed ground control points (GCPs) taken from topographic maps at a scale of 1:50000. The other three Landsat images (1985 TM, 2000 TM, and 2010 ETM+) were then referenced by performing the image-to-image registration method using the corrected Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS 2017 image as a reference image. The first-degree polynomial method and nearest neighbor resampling technique were applied when performing the geometrical rectification and image registration.
Because of scan line corrector (SLC) failure (known as the SLC-Off problem) that occurred on May 31, 2003, for the Enhanced Thermal Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor of Landsat 7, all Landsat 7 images collected from that date till 2013 have had line gaps appear as long lines on both sides of each image, resulting in a loss about 22% of data. However, it was found that the effect of those missing data was slight or passable in some applications, such as monitoring land use change and crop quality 
Landsat 8 OLI and Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery were sharpened to increase the resolution from 30 m to 15 m, where the spatial information in the high-resolution panchromatic bands and the color information in the multispectral bands were merged using the nearest neighbor diffusion (NNDiffuse) pan sharpening technique in order to create a more valuable color image with high resolution that improves mapping and classification accuracy  | Image Classification: Image classification is an important remote sensing technique used to catalog all pixels in an image or raw remotely sensed data into a finite number of individual LULC classes to produce beneficial thematic maps and information 
For this study, a classification scheme was developed after Anderson et al.  | Image Classification: Image classification is an important remote sensing technique used to catalog all pixels in an image or raw remotely sensed data into a finite number of individual LULC classes to produce beneficial thematic maps and information 
For this study, a classification scheme was developed after Anderson et al. 
There are several different methods of imagery data classification; however, unsupervised and supervised techniques are the two main approaches commonly used for mapping land cover 
Classification accuracy was assessed using measures derived from the error matrices, and these included overall accuracy and kappa coefficient. In addition, user's and producer's accuracies were also obtained for each class, which respectively measure the commission and omission errors. The value of overall accuracy greater than 70% is regarded as an acceptable classification accuracy  | Change Detection: Change detection is defined as ""the process of identifying differences in the state of an object or phenomenon by observing it at different times"" 
The post-classification approach involves the classification of multiple date images separately to generate thematic maps, after which a pixel-based comparison of the corresponding classes is used to produce tables and maps of changes that have occurred 
The magnitude of change (MC), the percentage of change (PC), and the annual rate of change (ARC) for each LULC class during each period of time were computed based on the following equations:
ARC ha. year
where A i is the class area (ha) at the initial time, A f is the class area (ha) at the final time, and n is the number of years of the time period. | Results and Discussion:  | Accuracy Assessment: The use of maximum likelihood classifier to categorize the Landsat images (TM, ETM+, and OLI/TIRS) has produced maps showing the distribution of the five prevalent LULC classes in the study area for the years 1985, 2000, 2011, and 2017. Accuracy assessment was carried out for the classified maps of 2010 and 2017 to examine the agreement between the produced maps and what actually exists on the ground. Table 
The LULC classification of Landsat ETM+ 2010 and OLI 2017 recorded the largest commission and omission error within the BLV, IC, and OR classes (Figure  | Year: Overall Accuracy (%) The classified maps of 2010 and 2017 achieved overall accuracy values of 81% and 83%, respectively, indicating that both LULC maps met the criterion. Furthermore, values of the kappa coefficient for both the two maps were more than 0.75, indicating good agreements. Results also showed that means of commission and omission errors were less than 20%, inferring an acceptable classification accuracy.
The LULC classification of Landsat ETM+ 2010 and OLI 2017 recorded the largest commission and omission error within the BLV, IC, and OR classes (Figure  | Supervised Classification: The processing and supervised classification of Landsat imagery (TM, ETM+, and OLI/TIRS) acquired in 1985, 2000, 2010, and 2017 produced four classification maps for the five LULC types prevalent in the study area (Figure  | Supervised Classification: The processing and supervised classification of Landsat imagery (TM, ETM+, and OLI/TIRS) acquired in 1985, 2000, 2010, and 2017 produced four classification maps for the five LULC types prevalent in the study area (Figure  | Supervised Classification: The processing and supervised classification of Landsat imagery (TM, ETM+, and OLI/TIRS) acquired in 1985, 2000, 2010, and 2017 produced four classification maps for the five LULC types prevalent in the study area (Figure  | LULC Change Detection: The outcomes of the post-classification comparison give an account of the amount and type of change that has taken place for each LULC class. Areal change of LULC types in all imageries was obviously visible and occurred as either an expansion or a decline between sequential dates. Attempts to further study these outcomes can give insight to the land use behavior, pattern, and rate at which the changes occur in the study area in particular and in the region of Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar in general. This essential information would be vital for development planners and decision makers.
Change matrices and statistics for the periods of 1985-2000, 2000-2010, and 2010-2017 were generated from the comparison of classified maps of 1985, 2000, 2010, and 2017 and will be discussed in detail in the following sections. | LULC Change between 1985 and 2000: In 1985, the NMF class constituted the major type of LULC in the study area at 64.17% of the total area, followed by OR (20.62%), IR (7.44%), and UB (4.79%), whereas BLV only covered 3% and occupied the smallest area. During the 15-year time frame from 1985 to 2000, the area covered by NMF declined by 2724 ha, viz. 11.79% of the initial area, while other LULC types increased at different rates. Table 
It is important to remember that, in 1986, under the previous political regime, the Ministry of Agriculture in Libya was abolished with all its departments and various control and enforcement agencies at the national level including the forest guard; thus, the agricultural sectors in all regions regrouped under the management of the sector directors, and this encouraged forests encroachment and failure of protection efforts. The weakness of institutions and absence of accountability among other factors encouraged the local people to engage in forest encroachment by either clearance of vegetation cover for agricultural expansion or by cutting trees for gathering firewood, especially for making the popular Libyan bread, in addition to producing charcoal for heating, barbecue, and cooking. In addition, some landowners have tried exploiting forest land in an attempt to regain their lands that were confiscated and turned into state property by law (No. 142 of 1970). Although the Ministry of Agriculture was reinstated in 1990 and a new forest law was enacted in 1992 to correct the accesses committed, the disaster of forest loss had already taken place and its negative effects were visible and tangible.
On the other hand, forests in Libya, like others in the Mediterranean region, which is one of the most affected regions by forest fires, have suffered excessive degradation by fires which are mainly due to manmade activities 
The area of agricultural land in 2000, in comparison to 1985, increased by 2050 ha, where the area of OR increased from 7426 ha (20.62%) to 8659 ha (24.05%) with an annual rate of 82 ha.year -1 , while the area of IC increased from 2679 ha (7.44%) to 3496 (9.71%) with an annual rate of 55 ha.year -1 (Table 
Libya has given the agricultural sector the largest share of the allocation of its transformation agenda through developmental projects during the 1970s and 1980s such as vertical and horizontal expansion in crop and fodder production. The region of Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar received a large share of these allocations that were used to reclaim large tracts of land estimated at about 160,000 ha. New farms were established in the Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar region to produce fruit and grain crops to attain self-sufficiency in food production; however, substantial areas of natural cover have been left without change for conservation purposes or to be used for natural grazing, particularly on hilly sites. The local people later exploited these marginal unused areas for establishing more private fields to produce cereal crops as well as fruits and irrigated vegetables in order to capitalize on the increasingly lucrative market.

The results shown in Table  | LULC Change between 2000 and 2010: During the 10 years between 2000 and 2010, more forest land was cleared or changed to other land uses. NMF areas, which amounted to 20,385ha (56.61%) in 2000, decreased to 17,685 ha (49.11%) in 2010, with an annual rate of 270 ha.year -1 (1.32%) (Table  | LULC Change between 2000 and 2010: During the 10 years between 2000 and 2010, more forest land was cleared or changed to other land uses. NMF areas, which amounted to 20,385ha (56.61%) in 2000, decreased to 17,685 ha (49.11%) in 2010, with an annual rate of 270 ha.year -1 (1.32%) (Table 
During the second period, each of the OR and IC classes increased by 1214 ha, with an annual rate of 121 ha.year -1 (Table 
Population growth and the consequent increase in food demand encouraged farmers in the study area to extend their cultivated areas through the clearance of more forests in order to benefit from the increased profits by marketing the agricultural produce in neighboring towns and cities as well as in the remote areas in the west of the country. Drilling more underground wells by the local population in the study area, either at their own expense or through state support in form of agricultural and pastoral loans, has greatly augmented the rate of deforestation and land conversion for irrigated agriculture.
Classification results shown in Table 
The increase in urban expansion might be attributed to population growth within the region of Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar through the period 1995-2006 (Figure 
The area of BLV in the period between 2000 and 2010, unlike in the previous period  | LULC Change between 2010 and 2017: The results shown in Table 
It should be recalled that the deforestation during the third period was induced by some factors entirely unlike those during the previous periods from 1985 to 2010. Presently, increased deforestation might be attributed to a of factors including the total breakdown of the Al-Qaddafi regime in 2011 and the accompanying chaos and spread of weapons, the inability of subsequent governments to prevent forest clearance, the lack of housing projects, and the significant increase in land price. Some citizens exploited the fall of the government regime, the cessation of regulatory agencies, and the complete absence of agricultural policing to clear more forest land for agricultural expansion or to sell cleared land building houses or construction of holiday homes and resorts.
The supervised classification analysis indicated an increase in the area of agricultural land in the study area during the third period (2010-2017), which was estimated at 1883 ha, where the area of agricultural land use increased from 14,583 ha (40.50% of total area) in 2010 to 15,466 ha (44.72% of total area) in 2017 (Table 
The results shown in Table 
During the third period, UB extended from 6.75% to 10.70% of the total land use and had an annual rate of increase of 8.36%, which was much higher compared to the previous periods. The UB area increased from 2430 ha in 2010 to 3852 ha in 2017, achieving a total increase of 1422 ha and representing about 58.52% of the initial area. The annual rate of increase during this period which was estimated at 203 ha.year -1 (Table 
Results in Table 
Several factors were responsible for the increase in the urban expansion in the Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar region. The most important factors are administrative causes that are related to the state policy, the weak application of legislation, and urban laws relating to the protection of agricultural and forest lands. Furthermore, population concentration in cities is not in tandem with their needs for residential schemes due to poor planning and organization which have contributed to the emergence of social and financial motivation for unplanned urban sprawl represented in the dominance of some tribes on large areas of land who capitalized on the housing deficit and the lack of new housing projects to sell land as residential plots without approval from the state. On the other hand, after the fall of the previous political regime in 2011, some people misappropriated state funds and bought lands in or around cities and then constructed residential or holiday houses as a means of money laundering. Additionally, some people from outside the district, particularly displaced citizens and migrants from some Arabic countries who left their homelands fleeing the menace of ongoing wars and armed conflicts, have shown interest in acquiring land and building houses to live in the study area. These people perceive the study area as comparatively safer than other regions in Libya, so land ownership is regarded as a means of attaining stability.
Additionally, because the region of Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar includes the finest places for tourism and recreation in Libya, the demand for accommodations for tourists and visitors has increased, which encouraged some citizens to establish more holiday homes and resorts in the absence of government control and stringent regulations.
The results in Table 
On the other hand, forest fires were a serious occurrence that led to the increase in the area of BLV land and to the decline of natural vegetation. Government reports indicated a significant increase in forest fires in Libya after 2011. In May 2013, after a dry season with severe shortage of rainfall and severe heat wave, a total of 5924 ha was destroyed in Libya due to more than seven fires of at least 40 ha, most of which occurred in the Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar region, which includes a single very large fire of more than 3300 ha 
The increased demand for firewood during the years following the Libyan uprising as a result of the wars which broke out in some Libyan cities was another factor that contributed to the decline in forest cover and to the increase in BLV. A severe shortage of cooking gas and kerosene in addition to electricity outage were common during the period after 2011. This has forced citizens to seek alternatives for heating and cooking; regrettably, they found cutting forest trees to be the easier option for gathering firewood and for producing charcoal for use or selling in local markets. Cutting forest trees is a negative phenomenon that can lead to stripping plenty of spaces of their natural vegetation cover. In fact, in such a semiarid climate, the loss of natural trees is difficult to recover due to the inability of the existing tree species in the region to regenerate naturally in addition to other limiting factors such as insufficient moisture due to frequent droughts and soil shallowness resulting from increased erosion rate after removal of protective vegetation. | Conclusion: Remote sensing is an effective tool for mapping natural resources at a regional level. The outcomes of the investigation enumerated in this research highlight the importance of satellite digital image processing with the aid of GIS technology in mapping and detecting LULC changes. Maximum likelihood supervised classification of Landsat TM5, ETM+7, and OLI8 imagery and post-classification comparison approach can be used to predict and obtain fairly accurate maps of LULC changes. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient values of the LULC classifications achieved in this research is encouraging. It was generally observed that there was a significant decline in natural Mediterranean forest (NMF) and a corresponding increase in other land uses such as orchards and rain-fed agriculture (OR), irrigated crops (IC), urban and built-up lands (UB), and bare and low vegetation (BLV). The changes observed were indicative of a decrease in the expanse of NMF land, which lost about 39% of its total area over the 32 years, and the highest deforestation rate was registered in the third period (2010-2017). The high deforestation was generally a result of citizen exploitation of the weakness of the state's institutions post 2011 revolution in addition to the frequency of forest fires. Most of the changed area of NMF were converted for agricultural land use. Land under the OR class increased by about 55% and achieved a greater rate of increase during the third period, whereas the land under the IC class increased by about 85% with a higher rate of increase achieved between 2000 and 2010, and the lowest rate was recorded during the third period from 2010 to 2017. The urban expansion in the study area was mostly at the expense of forest and agricultural lands. The annual rate of urbanization during the third period was approximately 10 and 5 times more than those recorded in the first period 
Indeed, if the present trend of deforestation continues, the forest in the study area will lose more than 50% of its current natural forest cover over the next 15 years. Deforestation in the study area and Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar in general is an important environmental challenge.","Monitoring land-cover changes: A comparison of change detection techniques (, 1999) || A study of change in agricultural and forest land in Gwalior city using satellite imagery (, , , , 2017) || Monitoring and predicting land use change in Tripoli Metropolitan City using an integrated Markov chain and cellular automata models in GIS (, , 2014) || Time series land cover mapping and change detection analysis using geographic information system and remote sensing (, , , , , , , , 2018) || Changing consumption patterns-Drivers and the environmental impact (, , , 2018) || Land use change around protected areas: Management to balance human needs and ecological function (, , , , , 2007) || Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015: How are the World's Forests Changing?

Impact of Land Cover Changes on Land Surface Temperature and Human Thermal Comfort in Dhaka City of Bangladesh,H Imran; Anwar Hossain; ‚Ä¢ Saiful Islam; Ataur Rahman; Md Abul; Ehsan Bhuiyan; Supria Paul; Akramul Alam,"Urbanization leads to the construction of various urban infrastructures in the city area for residency, transportation, industry, and other purposes, which causes major land use change. Consequently, it substantially affects Land Surface Temperature (LST) by unbalancing the surface energy budget. Higher LST in city areas decreases human thermal comfort for the city dwellers and affects the urban environment and ecosystem. Therefore, a comprehensive investigation is needed to evaluate the impact of land use change on the LST. Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques were used for the detailed investigation. RS data for the years 1993, 2007 and 2020 during summer (March-May) in Dhaka city were used to prepare land cover maps, analyze LST, generate hazard maps and relate the land cover change with LST by using GIS. The results show that the built-up area in Dhaka city increased by 67% from 1993 to 2020 by replacing lowland mainly, followed by vegetation, bare soil and water bodies. LSTs found in the study area were ranged from 23.","Introduction: Urban land use changes play an important role in influencing regional climate 
Published in partnership with CECCR at King Abdulaziz University surfaces to built-up areas affects the amount of humidity in the air, which is related to atmospheric temperature 
The increased global population is accelerating the demand for accommodations, agricultural production, food and shelter. Consequently, the land cover characteristic is changing for meeting the increased demand of population and replacing the vegetated area with impervious surfaces due to anthropogenic activities, and therefore, leading to climate changes inadvertently 
Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) are widely used tools to investigate LULC changes and associated LST 
Some studies show that the temperature vegetation index (TVX) was constructed to investigate the influence of land changes over LST 
Rapid urbanization has been taking place in the major cities particularly in capital cities (e.g. Delhi, Dhaka, etc.) of the developing countries. Dhaka is the capital of Bangladesh and one of the most densely populated megacities in the world with a population growth of 37.38% in the last decade which leads to its rapid urbanization 
Many recent studies focused on the prediction of future land use change and their relationship with LST based on 1 3
Published in partnership with CECCR at King Abdulaziz University four LULC indexes over three major cities: Dhaka, Chittagong and Rajshahi in Bangladesh 
On the other hand, a few studies in Dhaka city investigated the thermal comfort conditions affecting by urbanization.  | Methodology:  | Study Area: This study investigates the LULC changes and LST in Dhaka (Fig.  | Remote Sensing and Temperature Data: Landsat satellite image data of the Dhaka city for the years  | Methods of Land Cover Classification:  | Land Cover Classification: Supervised classification has been followed in this study to classify land cover from Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI/ TIRS data. The user defines the known land cover in supervised classification and develops the cell signature value for each land cover type. Built-up area, water bodies, vegetation, bare soil and low land have been chosen as major land cover based on the previous research in Dhaka city (Ahmed 1 3
Published in partnership with CECCR at King Abdulaziz University   | Accuracy Assessment of Land Cover Map: The accuracy assessment of classified land cover maps for different years was made by using the confusion matrix method. Total 250 points were randomly selected on the classified image, which was matched with Google Earth and Sentinel images for verification and accuracy calculation. The overall accuracy of the classified images was obtained from accuracy assessment, which indicated the percentage of correctly classified points to the total number of points taken as Eq. 1:
There are two commonly used approaches named Producer's accuracy and User's accuracy, which are calculated individually for all land cover classes. The producer's accuracy is found in percentage by dividing the number of correct points in one class by the total number of points as derived from the reference image. It measures how well the land base has been classified. The error of omission is considered in the Producer's accuracy, which represents the proportion of observed points on the ground but not classified in the map 
Finally, all the derived LULC maps were validated based on the remote sensing images captured by Google Earth and Sentinel-2 for different locations in the city.

Specifically, to retrieve LST, TM band 6, ETM + band 6_1 (high gain) and TIRS band 10 were used in this study. TIRS band 11 was not used as the USGS recommended not to use because of its more significant calibration uncertainty 
LST was retrieved using digital numbers (DN) of the thermal band of Landsat 5 TM (band 6), Landsat 7 ETM + (band 6) and Landsat 8 OLI (band 10). Thermal band 6 of Landsat 5 and 7 was acquired by 120 m and 60 m resolution, respectively. In contrast, thermal band 10 was acquired by 100 m resolution, but all of those were resampled to 30 m resolution (Table  | Conversion of the Digital Number (DN) to Spectral Radiance (L Œª ): The following equations (Eqs. 7 and 8) were used to calculate the spectral radiance (L Œª ) from thermal bands of Landsat

where M L = band-specific multiplicative rescaling factor (0.0003342), QCAL = digital numbers of band 10, A L = band-specific additive rescaling factor (0.1). | Conversion of Spectral Radiance (L Œª ) to At-Satellite Brightness Temperature: The following equation (Eq. 9) was used to derive the atsatellite brightness temperature from spectral radiance:
where T B = at satellite brightness temperature (K), L Œª = spectral radiance, K 1 and K 2 = calibrated constant depending on the sensor of  | Calculation of Land Surface Temperature (LST): Obtained brightness temperature or black body temperature had to be corrected for spectral emissivity (Œµ) to determine LST.

Emissivity can be expressed as (Eq. 11):
where P V = proportion of vegetation; P V is calculated by Eq. 12:
Emissivity (Œµ) and Proportion of vegetation (P V ) were calculated by following  | Calculation of Human Thermal Comfort: Human thermal comfort (HTC) in urban areas provides information to the city dwellers and the urban planner about the adverse impacts on human health due to extreme temperatures and the increase of LST. To evaluate the HTC, two bio-meteorological indices were considered in this study: (a) the Discomfort Index (DI), and (b) the approximated wet-bulb globe temperature (AWBGT). 
where Ta is air temperature (¬∞C) and RH is relative humidity (%). This study used LST instead of Ta to calculate DI at the surface level as only LST is calculated from Landsat data. The thermal comfort at skin surface level is not usually evaluated as compared to pedestrian level; however, this study presents an understanding of how LULC changes can impact HTC at surface level.
Furthermore, AWBGT is an index that indicates outdoor thermal stress conditions. AWBGT is calculated following Eq. 14 by 
where e is water vapor pressure (hPa) and Ta is air temperature (¬∞C). In this case, LST was also used to calculate AWBGT at surface level instead of Ta. Water vapor pressure (e) used in Eq. 14 to calculate AWBGT was calculated using relative humidity and LST instead of air temperature. First, the Goff-gratch equation shown in Eq. 15 was used to calculate the saturation vapor pressure, and then vapor pressure was computed by using relative humidity:  | Calculation of NDVI, NDBI, NDWI and NDBAI: NDVI, NDBI, NDWI and NDBAI were used to characterize land cover class associated with LST 
where NIR in the near infrared band of the image (TM band 4, OLI band 5), RED = red band of the image (TM band 3, OLI band 4).
NDBI is sensitive to the built-up area and used as an indicator of built-up extent. NDWI is used to monitor water content in vegetation. In addition, to monitor the bareness of soil, NDBAI was also applied in this study area. NDBI, NDWI and NDBAI values vary between -1 and + 1. NDBI, NDWI and NDBAI was calculated following Eqs. 17, 18 and 19  | Results:  | Analysis of Land Cover Changes: Five major land cover classes in Dhaka City have been analyzed for representing the dominant land cover according to the area proportion of land cover classes. Different land cover analyses have been shown in the following sections starting with the accuracy assessment. | Accuracy Assessment: Land cover maps usually contain some errors due to classification techniques and methods of image acquisition  | Changes of Land Cover Areas: The final classified map was generated by showing different land cover types in Dhaka city for the years 1993, 2007 and 2020 (Fig. 
On the other hand, vegetation and water bodies gradually decreased while a considerable decrease in the lowland was found in the second stage of the study period (Fig. 
Trends and amount of land cover changes are shown in Table  | Changes in Land Surface Temperatures: The spatial distribution of LSTs with classified temperature zones was derived from Landsat thermal band for summer seasons in the years 1993, 2007 and 2020 (Fig.  | Variations of LSTs for Different Land Covers: Figure  | LST Changes in Converted LULC Areas: LST changes between 1993 and 2020 in newly grown land cover units are shown in Table  | LST and Observed Air Temperature: A comparison of derived LST for the specified date of the summer season for the particular years 1993, 2007 and 2020 and observed air temperature (March-May) from Dhaka weather station during the years of 1993 to 2020 is shown in Fig. 
The relationship between LST and air temperature in the study period from 1993 to 2020 for the weather station at Dhaka is shown in Fig. 
Published in partnership with CECCR at King Abdulaziz University therefore, the LST was substantially higher than the air temperature. The greater variations between LST and the air temperature was indicating the lower coefficient of determination (R 2 ). However, the relationship showed an increasing trend of LST and air temperature. | Analysis of Human Thermal Comfort: Changes in the human thermal Discomfort Index (DI) over the study area are shown in Fig. 
In the case of AWBGT, the index values are classified in three categories that represent an absence of heat stress conditions (< 27.7 ¬∞C), the heat stress increases (27.7 ¬∞C to < 32.2 ¬∞C) and great heat stress danger occurs (> 32.2 ¬∞C)  | Relationship Between LST and Land Cover Indices: Variation of LST depends on land cover types. 
The impact of land cover change on the LST has mainly been focused on the previous sections, however, there was also an impact of climate change. Several previous studies in Bangladesh showed the trend of temperature change due to climate change. For example, 
From the above results and discussion, the findings of this study can be summarized more specifically as follows:
(1) This study revealed significant growth (67.41%) of urban or built-up area, which was converted from vegetation, lowland, bare soil and water bodies. On the other hand, bare soil drastically increased by filling lowland with sand. As a result, the area of the higher temperature zone increased substantially.
(2) Built-up area and bare soil showed higher LST than other land covers while lowland exhibited lowest LST for all years. The spatial mean LST significantly increased by 6.43 ¬∞C during the study period.
(3) Gradual increase of LST was found for all land covers over the study period, which was the evidence of urban microclimate warming effect in Dhaka city and consistent with the previous studies 
Finally, regression analysis shows that LST increased (decreased) with the increase (decrease) of built-up (NDBI) and bareness indices (NDBAI). On the other hand, LST decreased with the increased vegetation (NDBI) and water body indices (NDWI) and vice-versa. | Conclusions: This study investigated the impact of land use and land cover changes on LST from 1993 to 2020 in Dhaka city of Bangladesh. Regression analysis was conducted to find the relationship between LST and four land cover indices. The land cover of Dhaka city was substantially altered due to rapid urbanization and socio-economic development. Built-up and bare soil areas increased by 13.61% and 25.24% from losing water bodies, vegetation and lowland during the study period. The built-up area drastically increased in the periphery and northern part of the city while substantial newly grown bareness area replaced most of the lowland and naturally vegetated areas. Expansion of urban area changed the surface radiative properties that imbalanced surface energy budget, and consequently, affected the LST with an increasing trend. Spatial distribution of maximum and mean LST in Dhaka city showed the increase of 4.62 ¬∞C and 6.43 ¬∞C, respectively, during the study period, while the change in minimum LST was not substantial. Area of higher temperature zones increased due to the expansion of urban areas and bare lands. It is also notable that the mean LST gradually increased from 1993 to 2020 irrespective of land cover type. This was partly due to the impact of climate change; however, further study will be needed to confirm this. Builtup area and bare soil showed a higher LST while lowland showed the lowest LST. The increase of LST over time was mainly occured due to urbanization. Furthermore, human thermal discomfort substantially shifted from moderate to strong heat stress during the study period. Finally, the results show that NDWI and NDVI were negatively correlated with LST while NDBI and NDBAI were positively correlated.
Based on the above findings, policymakers in Dhaka city should concern about future urban expansion both horizontally and vertically and should make a proper plan for environment-friendly construction, green building, and green or cool roof technology to reduce the urban microclimatewarming effect. Growth management policies should be suggested to reduce the LST-related urban heat island problem.","Simulating land cover changes and their impacts on land surface temperature in dhaka, bangladesh

Land-Use Land-Cover Classification by Machine Learning Classifiers for Satellite Observations-A Review,Swapan Talukdar; Pankaj Singha; Susanta Mahato; Swades Pal; Yuei-An Liou; Atiqur Rahman,"Rapid and uncontrolled population growth along with economic and industrial development, especially in developing countries during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, have increased the rate of land-use/land-cover (LULC) change many times. Since quantitative assessment of changes in LULC is one of the most efficient means to understand and manage the land transformation, there is a need to examine the accuracy of different algorithms for LULC mapping in order to identify the best classifier for further applications of earth observations. In this article, six machine-learning algorithms, namely random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy adaptive resonance theory-supervised predictive mapping (Fuzzy ARTMAP), spectral angle mapper (SAM) and Mahalanobis distance (MD) were examined. Accuracy assessment was performed by using Kappa coefficient, receiver operational curve (RoC), index-based validation and root mean square error (RMSE). Results of Kappa coefficient show that all the classifiers have a similar accuracy level with minor variation, but the RF algorithm has the highest accuracy of 0.89 and the MD algorithm (parametric classifier) has the least accuracy of 0.82. In addition, the index-based LULC and visual cross-validation show that the RF algorithm (correlations between RF and normalised differentiation water index, normalised differentiation vegetation index and normalised differentiation built-up index are 0.96, 0.99 and 1, respectively, at 0.05 level of significance) has the highest accuracy level in comparison to the other classifiers adopted. Findings from the literature also proved that ANN and RF algorithms are the best LULC classifiers, although a non-parametric classifier like SAM (Kappa coefficient 0.84; area under curve (AUC) 0.85) has a better and consistent accuracy level than the other machine-learning algorithms. Finally, this review concludes that the RF algorithm is the best machine-learning LULC classifier, among the six examined algorithms although it is necessary to further test the RF algorithm in different morphoclimatic conditions in the future.","Untitled Section: Knowledge of land-use/land-cover (LULC) change is essential in a number of fields based on the use of Earth observations, such as urban and regional planning 
Several techniques have been developed to map LULC patterns and dynamics from the satellite observations, including traditional terrestrial mapping, as well as satellite-based mapping. Terrestrial mapping, known as a field survey, is a direct way of mapping in which the map can be produced at various scales incorporating information with different levels of precision, although it is a manpowerbased, time-and money-consuming way to map large areas 
Recently, the application of machine-learning algorithms on remotely-sensed imageries for LULC mapping has been attracting considerable attention 
Over the last decade, more advanced methods, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), SVM, RF, decision tree, and other models, have gained exceptional attention in remote sensing-based applications, such as LULC classification. Thus, numerous studies on the LULC modelling have been carried out using different machine-learning algorithms 
Several studies found that the LULC classification using medium-and low-resolution observations from satellites has several spectral and spatial limitations that affect its accuracy  | Materials and Methods:  | Study Area: We selected a stretch of riparian landscape of the river Ganga from Rajmahal to Farakka barrage in India emphasizing three major dynamic river islands (locally, charland) dominated by patches. LULC classification in relatively stable areas is easier than highly dynamic landscape like charland and such work is undertaken by many scholars. How far the advanced methods are useful for delineating LULC units in such a dynamic area was given emphasis with different approaches of accuracy assessment. Successful application of one method in different similar sites proves its usability. Hence, to test the precision of the applied methods three such patches from the study stretch were used. The study area covers parts of Jharkhand and the West Bengal states of India. More precisely, it covers some parts of Sahibganj District of Jharkhand and Malda and the Murshidabad districts of West Bengal (Figure  | Materials: In this work, the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image (path/row 139/43) downloaded from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov) ) has been used to map the LULC using different machine-learning algorithms (Figure  | Methods for Land-Use/Land-Cover (LULC) Modelling: The LULC classification was performed using the six most popular machine-learning classifiers. The descriptions of the parameters for optimizing the models and software used to perform the LULC classification are given in Table 
The ANN is a forward structure black-box model, which is trained by back propagation algorithm (supervised training algorithm). The ANN is functioned like a human brain or nervous system containing nerve fibres with many interconnections through other axons 
One of most important algorithms that ANN usually uses is the back propagation algorithm, which is a gradient-decent algorithm. The main function of it is to minimize the error between the actual network outputs and the outputs of training input/output pairs 
The MLP architecture can be explained mathematically. In MLP architecture, the input layer comprises the n0 neurons, which collect a normalized set of input variables of xi (i = 1, 2‚Ä¶‚Ä¶n0). The second layer is also known as the hidden layer that contains the n1 neurons and receives a set of variables of yj(j = 1, 2‚Ä¶‚Ä¶...n1), which are the output of the first layer. Each of the layers receive a bias value of 1 in each of the neurons that rectify their outputs. The third or output layer consists of the n2 neurons with number equal to output variables of zk(K = 1, 2‚Ä¶., n2). A continuous non-linear mapping is performed in the n0 neurons of xi variables in the output layer to the yi variables in the hidden layer after summing them up using an activation function. The parameter of this function is also defined as weights of neurons in each hidden layer for each result of neurons of the input layer 
where n represents the number of classes, i a denotes the expected output, and i b is the response of designed ANN from the i neuron of the total n neurons in the output layer.  | Support Vector Machine (SVM): SVM is a non-parametric supervised machine learning technique and initially aimed to solve the binary classification problems 
The original SVM method has been launched with a set of data, and its objective is to find the hyper-plane that can separate the datasets into a number of classes, as the aim of SVM is to find the optimal separating hyper-plane from the available hyper-planes  | 3.Fuzzy ARTMAP (FA): The fuzzy ARTMAP technique is based on the similarity of the fuzzy subset calculation as well as the adaptive and vibrant category selection through the feature space search. The structure of fuzzy ARTMAP includes two modules, i.e., ARTa and ARTb. These two modules can be further sub-divided into two sub-modules in the function (attention and orientation subsystem). The attention subsystem has several functions. For example, it deals with the modules, establishes the exact internal illustration, and creates fine-tuning for the modules. In contrast, the orientation subsystem is used for dealing with the newly appeared module 
Based on the comprehensive investigation of fuzzy ARTMAP as well as the characteristics of remote-sensing data, a simplified fuzzy ARTMAP algorithm has been applied using the Terrset software. It comprises two layers in which the first is used for the feature data input and the second for the classification of remote-sensing data. In the first layer, the numbers of neurons are equal to the feature dimensions of the data, while in the second layer, the numbers of neurons are decided by the user as per the trial and process results 
4. Random Forest RF is a new non-parametric ensemble machine-learning algorithm developed by Breiman 
In recent times, several studies have shown a satisfactory performance for LULC classification using RF in the field of remote-sensing applications  | Method for Parametric Classifier:  | Mahalanobis Distance (MD): Supervised image classification is performed to detect the quantitative approach in the remotesensing image. The prime goals of supervised classification are to segment the spectral domain into the areas that match the ground cover interest classes for a particular purpose. The Mahalanobis distance (MD) supervised image classification algorithm was developed by an Indian applied statistician Mahalanobis in the 1930s 
where i
x is the vector showing the pixel of image data, k x is the sample mean vector of the k th class,
V is the variance/covariance matrix for class i ; and T represents transpose of the matrix. | Method for Non-Parametric Classifier: 1. Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) SAM is an auto-generated supervised spectral classifier machine learning technique that is used to determine the spectral similarity between the given image spectra and reference spectra in an n (here n denotes the spectral band number) dimensional space using the calculation of the angle between the spectra 
In SAM, only angular information can be used to identify the pixel spectra. Thus, SAM uses only angular information to identify the pixel spectra, which assumes that an observed reflectance spectrum in a vector format is a multidimensional space with the number of dimensions equal to the number of bands. The difference between image spectra and reference spectra is shown as the level of angle where a small angle indicates high similarity and a high angle indicates low similarity. The maximum threshold limits of tolerance of angle are not classified. Hence, it is better to define a threshold angle limit (in radians) under which a pixel cannot be classified. In our study, SAM has been applied using the ENVI 5.3 image processing environment for LULC classification. This technique is comparatively intensive for illumination and albedo conditions while calibrating reflectance information. The SAM is auto-generated supervised classification. | Similarity Test among the Classifiers: For representing the difference of performance of the algorithms for delineating LULC, similarity ratio (SR) is computed. It is simply the ratio between proportions of area of a given LULC computed by two algorithms. SR = 1 signifies the absolute similarity of the areal proportion of LULC computed by two algorithms. A value >1 or <1 means growing dissimilarity. | Accuracy Assessment and Correlation among the Classifiers: The post-classification accuracy assessment has been considered as the most vital part of validating the LULC maps produced by the models 
The receiver operating characteristics (RoC) curve graph was plotted to validate the performance of LULC classifiers for detecting the different features of LULC. The graph was plotted between sensitivity and specificity being on y and x axes, respectively. The sensitivity of a model represents the proportion of correctly predicted positive pixels (i.e., the pixels belonging to a particular LULC class were correctly predicted or identified), while the specificity refers to the proportion of correctly predicted negative pixels (i.e., the pixels not belonging to a particular LULC class was correctly predicted or identified). The sensitivity and specificity were calculated following Equations ( 
where represents true positive, d refers to true negative, b means false positive, and c represents false negative. The area under curve (AUC) of the RoC curve depict the performance of classifiers for predicting the LULC. The value of AUC ranges from 0-1, while the AUC close to 1 represents the high degree of model performances.
The root mean square error (RMSE) was computed to evaluating the performance of machine learning classifiers using the observed and prediction sample points. The RMSE was calculated by using Equation 
where n represents the number of sample points.
The ""index-based technique"" has been introduced to evaluate and select the best machinelearning technique for LULC mapping. Thus, three satellite data-derived indices; normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), normalized differential water index (NDWI) and normalized differential built-up index (NDBI), have been calculated for this purpose. Each index has been classified based on a manual threshold. For better visualization, LULC classes (water, vegetationagricultural land, built-up area) and threshold-based NDWI, NDVI, NDBI have been masked out from the study area using the selected three windows. The closeness of the area between the indexderived area and classifier-derived LULC area could be considered as a good result and vice versa. Then, we used correlation matrix among the area of land use classes of six LULC models and satellite data-derived indices to statistically validate the index-based methods:
We also used a visual interpretation procedure to evaluate the accuracy assessment of LULC models. Furthermore, Karl Pearson's coefficient of correlation technique was applied to understand the association among the results of area coverage of land use classes obtained from the six LULC models. Higher correlation coefficient values indicate conformity of the models. | Results:  | LULC Classification: The spatial analysis of the LULC map shows that the built-up area, and rivers and wetland are more prominent and clearer in the outputs of SVM and random forest classifiers, while they are least prominent in the output of SAM. On the other hand, the fallow land and agricultural land are more prominent in the output of ANN, followed by fuzzy ARTMAP and Mahalanobis distance classifiers. The vegetation cover and sand bar are fairly classified in all classifiers. In RF and SVM, they are excellently classified (Figure  | Validation of the LULC Classification: The overall accuracy (in percentage) using Kappa coefficient (K) for all the classifiers is shown in Table 
The water bodies and wetlands have been classified very well and they can be matched with the Google Earth images in three sites, whereas both vegetation and agricultural land have been prominently visualized by all classifiers. In the cases of RF, fuzzy ARTMAP and SVM, the land-use features were classified very well as proved by comparing with the Google Earth images. Although it is very difficult to model a built-up area with 30-meter resolution images, machine-learning algorithms with good training sites can perform predictions very well. Therefore, in the present study, some classifiers like MD and fuzzy ARTMAP generated more built-up area than the other classifiers and even the reality. However, the ANN, RF and SAM have classified built-up area as found in Google Earth images and even similar to what we have found in the field survey. | Discussion:  | Variation in LULC in the Output of Classifiers Used: Several studies reported that the areas of LULC classes are not equal in all the classification techniques, whether machine-learning algorithms or traditional classification techniques are adopted  | Comparison of Accuracy Assessment of Different Classifiers with the Literature: The accuracy of a classification varied with methods, techniques, time and space  | Conclusions: This study was conducted to examine the accuracy of different machine-learning classifiers for LULC mapping for satellite observations. The aim was to suggest the best classifier. Six machinelearning algorithms were applied on the Landsat 8 (OLI) data for the LULC classification. Accuracy assessments were undertaken by using the Kappa coefficient, an index-based technique and empirical observations. Results suggest that the area under each LULC class varies under different classifiers. The maximum variation is observed for the agricultural and fallow lands, while the minimum for the water bodies and wetlands. Such variation requires a need to prove the best suited classifier.
Furthermore, the Kappa coefficient and index-based analysis also show variation in the accuracy of each LULC classifier. The variation in the accuracy of the classifiers used is found to be minor, but this minor variation has very important significance in the area of LULC mapping and planning. Both the Kappa coefficient and index-based analysis show that the RF has the highest accuracy of all classifiers applied in this study. To justify the result, previous literature on this was taken into consideration and most of the studies concluded that either RF or ANN is the best classifier. Although the previous studies found a higher accuracy for RF and ANN than this study, this study concludes that RF is the best machine-learning classifier for LULC modelling in the highly dynamic charlanddominated areas. Furthermore, numerous studies suggested that the accuracy of LULC mapping varies with time and location. Thus, for future research, it is suggested to analyse the accuracy of the classifiers for different morphoclimatic and geomorphic conditions."," (, ) || Change analysis of land use/land cover and

Past and Future Land Use/Land Cover Changes in the Ethiopian Fincha Sub-Basin,Motuma Shiferaw; Michael Nones,"The increasing human pressure on African regions is recognizable when looking at Land Use Land Cover (LULC) change maps, generally derived from satellite imagery. Using the Ethiopian Fincha watershed as a case study, the present work focuses on (i) identifying historical LULC change in the period 1989-2019; (ii) estimating LULC in the next thirty years, combining Geographical Information Systems (GIS) with Land Change Modelling (LCM). Landsat 5/8 images were combined with field evidence to map LULC in three reference years (1989, 2004, 2019), while the Multi-Layer Markov Chain (MPL-MC) model of LCM was applied to forecast LULC in 2030, 2040, and 2050. The watershed was classified into six classes: waterbody, grass/swamp, built-up, agriculture; forest; and shrub. The results have shown that, in the past 30 years, the Fincha watershed experienced a reduction in forest and shrubs of about -40% and -13%, respectively, mainly due to ever-increasing agricultural activities, and such a trend is also expected in the future. In fact, for the period 2019-2050, LCM simulated a significant decrease in both forest and shrubs (around -70% and -20%, respectively), in favor of more areas covered by grass (19%) and built-up (20%). It is worth noting that a decrease in natural forests can drive an increase in soil erosion, fostering siltation in the water reservoirs located in the sub-basin. The study pointed out the urgency of taking actions in the sub-basin to counteract such changes, which can eventually lead to a less sustainable environment.","Introduction: Land use is defined as how land is utilized by human beings and their habitats, usually with an accent on the practical role of land for economic activities, whereas land cover is a physical characteristic of the Earth's surface or attributes of a part of the Earth's land surface and immediate subsurface, including biota, soil, topography, surface and groundwater, and human structures 
The Land Change Modeler is a model used to evaluate the changing trend from one land use category to another and has been found to provide high spatial and temporal resolution with a reduced computational effort 
Few studies of LULC change provide a combined assessment of the driving forces and consequences of such variations, particularly in developing countries such as Bangladesh 
Indeed, in this region, the dynamics of LULC intensities and rates are changing and highly associated with overexploitation of natural resources, while the process is governed by climate (long dry periods followed by heavy precipitation), soil characteristics (thin layer of topsoil, silty texture, or low organic matter content), vegetation (barren land), topography (steep-slope), and natural hazards (forest fire, landslides) 
Focusing on the Fincha River sub-basin in Ethiopia, this research aims to: (i) understand the historical LULC changes over the past three decades (1989-2019); (ii) predict possible LULC patterns in the future three decades (2030-2050). The objectives of the paper will be tackled by combining satellite imagery (Landsat dataset) and modeling (LCM), using field evidence such as photos and information from local farmers to support the study. The study area and the methods used will be described in Section 2, while the results are presented and discussed in Section 3. In Section 4, the results are then discussed in light of actual policies on land management, showing the current limitations and possible future directions. The main outcomes of the study and its limitations are summarized in Section 5. | Materials and Methods:  | Study Area: The Fincha sub-basin is located in Ethiopia, Oromiyaa regional state, Horroo Guduruu Wallaggaa, in the Upper Blue Nile basin (UBNB), between latitudes 9 ‚Ä¢ 9 53 N to 10 ‚Ä¢ 1 00 N and longitudes 37 ‚Ä¢ 00 25 E to 37 ‚Ä¢ 33 17 E, at around 300 km from Addis Ababa (Figure 
Natural resources, such as the Fincha, Amarti, and Nashee lakes (see Figure  | Dataset: The study was performed using freely available satellite imagery and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The latter, having a resolution of 30 m and referring to 2019, was acquired from the GIS and Remote Sensing Department, Ministry of Water, Irrigation and Energy of Ethiopia 
Landsat-5 TM (L5, for the years 1989 and 2004) and Landsat-8 OLI-TIRS (L8, for the year 2019) data were downloaded from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website (earthexplorer.usgs.gov). As the Landsat-5 mission started in March 1984, it was not possible to acquire the images every 10 years, so the first reference year was set to 1989. The images referred to January, when there is a clear sky corresponding to the dry season, and were atmospherically corrected via QGIS (qgis.org). To cover the whole watershed area, a composite of Landsat images from different paths/rows was created, ensuring that the images refer to the same season (Table 
Open-ended questions about LULC's significant changes in the study area, the connection between the biophysical environment, institution, socioeconomic activity, and demography were utilized during both KII and FGD. To learn more from a management point of view, assess the efforts made towards resource management, and identify obstacles, discussions on the practices and regulations that affect land management and policies in the area were held. The topic of land degradation and the most urgent problems that need solutions were also covered. The major goals of the discussion and interviews were to gather enough information on the historical and present trends of LULC changes, identify their fundamental causes, and assess their effects on regional socio-economic life and the environment. In detail, farmers were asked to describe the areas of the landscape that have altered and to recognize the reasons behind those changes. Moreover, they were questioned on the effects of the modifications to their way of life, their surroundings, and their working environment. In addition, farmers were asked to describe how their socioeconomic activity affects the change in land usage.
Based on a checklist created in advance to assess the situation in the watershed, field observations were conducted, and images of significant sites were obtained. | Land Use Land Cover Classification of Historical Data: To map LULC, satellite images should be classified, assigning predefined LULC classes to some pixels. As pointed out by Jemberie et al. 
The study was performed by classifying three reference years 
Following ample literature on this topic e.g., 
To quantitatively assess the accuracy, statistical methods such as overall accuracy and kappa value were applied. Based on this, random sampling data were prepared to check the overall accuracy OA and to determine the kappa coefficient K. Comparing the total corrected samples TCS and the total samples TS, OA provides an idea of how many sites are correctly classified (Equation (

In LCM, there are two options for modeling algorithms that are used to model the transition variables: logistic regression and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network 
To evaluate the capability of LCM in predicting future LULC, a predicted map of 2019 was created based on 1989 and 2004 LULC, and then compared with the actual 2019 map. To evaluate the quality of the 2019 predicted map against the 2019 reference map, the TerrSet validation module was used 
Kappa indices, such as kappa for no information (Kno), kappa for location (Klocation), and kappa standards (Kstandards)l are used to identify potential errors 
To corroborate the study outcomes, a series of statistics were considered 
Driving forces are the factors that affect LULC changes at the local scale, and therefore they should be locally investigated and addressed 
The type of land cover is strongly correlated with anthropogenic disturbance, for example, the local population can access resources more conveniently while changing the land use because of the distance from the stream. The ease with which land can transition to urban usage depends on the distance from urban centers, which can be a highly powerful force for change. One of the key factors in drawing more urban uses and expansion is the distance from roads, which determines accessibility. The primary topographic component known to affect LULC change is elevation. In addition, it seems reasonable to use the evidence likelihood, a quantitative variable that reflects the likelihood of discovering change between agricultural land and all other land classes at the relevant pixel, given that the annual pace of agricultural expansion was considerable. The watershed slope influences the spatial trends of land cover change, leading one to assume that changes in land use are highly influenced by the terrain slope: gains in urban land are primarily concentrated on relatively flat slopes and deforestation declines as the slope's gradient increases.
It is worth remembering that the selection of variables and indicators, to a certain extent, may cause some differences in the simulation results or model parameters, which will have effects on the prediction of LULC change. For example, for distance from the road, if the forest is very close to the road, the rate of forest clearance (deforestation) is very high, and vice versa, i.e., if there is road availability, the people living nearby can clear the forest for agriculture or other purposes. This is also applicable to other driving factors. The Cramer's V Coefficient (CVC), sometimes called Cramer's V strategy  | LULC Detection: LULC changes were detected via a few parameters: magnitude of change C, rate of change R, and change percentage P, using the following equations [2,72,73]:
where i represents the LULC class, B i and L i are the areas [ha] with the earliest and latter LULC, respectively. The period between B i and L i is T [year] and determines the rate of change R i . Positive values of P i mean an increase in a specific LULC in the study period T (L i > B i , R i > 0), while negative values mean a decrease (L i < B i , R i < 0). | Results:  | Historical LULC Maps: Three reference years (1989, 2004, and 2019) were considered to evaluate historical LULC via a maximum likelihood supervised classification (Figure  | Accuracy Assessment for Historical LULC: The overall accuracies OA and kappa values K were 82.80%, 85.57%, and 89.82% and 80.51%, 82.54%, and 87.84%, respectively, for the three reference years (Tables 
Hailu et al.  | Historical LULC Changes and Transition Probability Matrix: Comparing the three reference years, it is possible to observe a considerable reduction in the area covered by forest and shrubs during the observation period (Table 
The results presented here are in line with the existing literature on LULC in the Fincha watershed 
Between 1989 and 2004, the highest and the lowest persistent LULC classes were waterbody and grass/swamps, characterized by a percentage of stability of 91% and 42%, respectively. During the period 2004-2019, the most and the least stable LULC class categories were waterbody and grass/swamp, which accounted for around 80% and 31%, respectively. Over the entire temporal horizon observed (1989 to 2019), a large part of the forest was converted to agriculture and grass/swamps (see Tables A4-A6 for the detailed LULC transition matrixes).
According to information obtained during field investigations (KII and field evidence), waterbodies increased after the construction of the Nashe Dam. During the construction of the reservoir, many farmers along and downstream of the Nashe stream were displaced to other agricultural places or towns. The abandonment of fields and the need for resettling in other areas caused a decrease in forests and an increase in built-up areas. In addition, poorly planned and long-term urban development and agricultural management strategies contribute to negatively affecting natural resources, causing a significant decline in the last decades (Figure  | Model Validation: The LULC map of 2019, predicted from the 1989 and 2004 data, has been validated with the classified LULC map of the very same year (Table  | Future LULC: To forecast future LULC changes, it is necessary to account for the most important driving variables (Table  | Discussion and Policy Implications: As suggested in the review carried out by Regasa et al. 
The reduction in forest cover pointed out in the present study compares well with similar research performed at the Ethiopian level 
As pointed out by Tolessa et al. 
As with other Ethiopian basins 
To provide both decision-makers and local stakeholders such as farmers with more evidence on the importance of safeguarding water resources and ecosystem services at the basin scale, additional studies are needed, also taking advantage of information remotely acquired, such as satellite imagery, or considering different simulation algorithms and expanding the dataset of field evidence. Indeed, acquiring ground truth data and information from the local population, paramount for assuring a proper calibration/validation of the model, in locations that are hardly reachable or with unstable political situations such as the Fincha sub-basin, could be very difficult and expensive. | Conclusions: The present study investigated the historical LULC 
The study results have shown that, over the last thirty years, the forest covering the Fincha watershed was mostly converted to agricultural and grass/swamp areas. An increase in zones covered by waterbody and built-up was also observable, mainly connected to the increasing human pressure and the construction of new hydropower reservoirs. This trend is recognizable not only in the study sub-basin but also in many Ethiopian basins 
As pointed out by the modeling results, in the future, a similar trend is more than probable. Indeed, if management strategies are not changed towards a more sustainable approach, also via proper reforms at the national level, an even more significant decrease in forest coverage should be expected in favor of new settlement areas and cropland. This change could help locals in sustaining their livelihood in the short term, but, in the medium/long term, the reduction in areas covered by forest will contribute to decreasing biodiversity and ecosystem services, as well as fostering soil erosion, with detrimental consequences such as reservoir siltation.
It is worth remembering that, to corroborate the results presented here and to reduce the uncertainties, additional data should be included in the study, mostly deriving from laborious and expensive field investigations. However, due to the current conditions of the study area, obtaining such information in the coming months could be very challenging. On the other hand, the increasing availability of commercial high-resolution satellite images could partially help in enlarging the dataset of field evidence, pointing out LULC changes happening at a more detailed scale. Therefore, in the future, a deeper analysis of satellite information is planned.

Rapid Land Cover Change in a Submerging Coastal County,Keryn Gedan; Rebecca Epanchin-Niell; Man Qi,"Sea level rise is reshaping the coasts, allowing coastal habitats such as tidal marshes to migrate inland. To predict where changes will occur, it is critical to understand the factors that influence land cover transition. Here, we test the influence of land cover type on land cover transition. We hypothesized that marsh migration may vary by upland land cover type, due to dominant plant species' differences in salinity and inundation tolerance. Additionally, the response of people may make specific land cover types more likely to be protected from transition. We measured land cover change in high resolution aerial imagery over the relatively short period of 2009 to 2017 in coastal Somerset County, Maryland. In logistic models of land cover transition, we found that 'agricultural land' and 'scrub shrub wetland / forested wetland' cover classes were more likely to transition to 'emergent wetland' than 'forest/scrub shrub' or 'urban or built-up land' cover classes, after controlling for elevation and distance to shore, two wellknown predictors of marsh migration. Over only 8 years, loss of upland area in the county totaled 6.1 km 2 , of which 5.7 km 2 was agricultural land. This represents a loss of over 2% of the farmland in the county, the majority of which converted to emergent wetland during the study period.","Introduction: Accelerated sea level rise is having a marked impact on coastal ecosystems. One of the most striking effects of sea level rise is the transition of uplands to tidal wetlands and open water 
Characteristics of the landscape are important determinants of the timing and pace of upland transition 
One landscape factor that has rarely been considered as a determinant of upland transition to marsh is upland land cover type, and that is the focus of this study. In one explicit consideration of upland land cover type, 
Furthermore, human interventions have great potential to alter the way upland land cover types transition by either slowing or accelerating change. The installation of tide gates, levees, or berms can prevent tidal influence and slow change, or fail suddenly and cause rapid change to marsh or open water. Terracing or surface regrading to raise the elevation of the land could also prevent upland conversion of areas in the so-called ""accommodation space"", where marsh migration is predicted to occur. Lastly, land management practices, such as timber harvest, might affect the water budget of forests or remove relict trees and alter light conditions in areas where forest regeneration has already ceased (""the persistent zone"", 
In this study, we investigated land cover transitions in a rapidly submerging county on the coast of the Chesapeake Bay over a short time period of 8 years. Using high resolution aerial imagery, we classified land use and land cover change from 2009 to 2017 to detect land use transitions and determine the effect of initial upland land cover type on the probability of upland transition. We also investigated the effect of other known landscape predictor variables, namely elevation and distance to shoreline, and their interaction with upland land cover type in determining transition to marsh. | Methods:  | Study Area: Somerset County, Maryland on the Lower Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay was selected as the study region due to the high rate of land use transition that has been observed there in recent years and attributed to rapid relative sea level rise  | Spatial Imagery Data: The National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) program provides statewide, high-resolution imagery during the growing season of every other year. The earliest NAIP images available for Maryland with complete spectral information (four spectral bands: near infrared, red, green, and blue) were collected in August 2009. June 2017 was the most recent available image. NAIP imagery has a spatial resolution of 1 m and a horizontal accuracy of 6.0 m. From our observation of error in 67 stable features (e.g. road intersection and building corners) from across the study area, there is a horizontal offset of 2.96 ¬± 1.65 m between images from 2009 to 2017.
One disadvantage of using NAIP data for classification is the high heterogeneity of images at fine scale spatial resolution, which can be challenging for classification algorithms. Additionally, processing time of these images is much greater due to the amount of data in even a relatively small study area such as ours. However, one advantage of using high resolution imagery is the ability of the human eye to detect land use cover types and validate classifications. Additionally, as opposed to coarser imagery such as Landsat, very fine scale changes can be detected. | Image Classification: We used a combination of automated classification and postclassification manual checking and review to interpret land cover from the NAIP images. The land cover types in our study area mainly included agricultural land, such as cropland, orchards, poultry houses, irrigation canals, and ponds; urban or built-up land, such as houses, lawns, highways, power infrastructure, towns, and commercial complexes; upland forest; estuarine and palustrine wetlands; and water bodies (see Fig. 1b, e). The land cover classes we used in this study were based on 
We ultimately selected six land cover classes, described in more detail below: (1) Forest/Scrub Shrub, (2) Agricultural Land, (3) Urban or Built-up Land, (4) Water, (5) Scrub Shrub Wetland / Forested Wetland, and (6) Emergent Wetland. It should be noted that Agricultural Land had two subclasses during classification, i.e. Bare Agricultural Land and Vegetated Agricultural Land, as agricultural lands can be bare or vegetated depending on the point in the harvest cycle at the time NAIP images were collected. These two subclasses were merged as Agricultural Land during post-classification.
Forest/Scrub Shrub Areas dominated by trees and/or shrubs with tree and shrub coverage of 30% or greater, regardless of tidal regime, salinity level, or understory plant community type.
Agricultural Land Crop fields, pastures, orchards, groves, vineyards, and nurseries, ornamental horticultural areas, confined feeding operations, farmsteads, holding areas for livestock.
Urban or Built-up Land Areas of intensive use with much of the land covered by structures. Included in this category are residential buildings, cities, towns, villages, commercial and industrial buildings and parking lots, and transportation and power infrastructure.
Scrub Shrub Wetland / Forested Wetland Wetlands with 10 to 30% coverage of woody vegetation, regardless of tidal regime or salinity level.
Emergent Wetland Tidal and nontidal wetlands with at least 30% coverage of emergent plants, emergent mosses or lichens and less than 10% coverage of trees and shrubs.
Water Permanent open water, aquatic bed, streams and canals, lakes, reservoirs, bays and estuaries, ditches and canals, and small ponds for farms.
These classes are here forth referred to by the bolded words for brevity.
For automated classification, we applied the Normalized Difference Water Index 
While training the classifier, two rounds of supervised classification were conducted with each of the segmented subset images using a decision tree algorithm. The decision tree algorithm was selected after visually comparing the performance of several other algorithms, namely k-nearest neighbor, Wetlands random forest, and support vector machine, in distinguishing the most similar or difficult to distinguish classes in our study system: e.g. 'Vegetated Agricultural Land' versus 'Emergent Wetland', 'Scrub Shrub Wetland / Forested Wetlands' versus 'Emergent Wetland', 'Bare Agricultural Land' versus 'Water' (Fig. 
After automated classification, we performed manual review and correction of 100% of the interpreted area of each individual year with incremental screen by screen (working west to east or north to south) qualitative review and corrected misclassified objects at 1:3000 scale with a Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) for each class as shown in Table  | Classification Accuracy Assessment and Change Detection: To assess classification accuracy, we randomly sampled 200 map objects per year from within 2009 and 2017 images and visually determined land cover type. The percentage of correctly classified points indicated the classification accuracy, i.e. Producer's Accuracy (PA). PA was calculated for each land cover class after automated classification and after manual correction.
We measured land cover change within polygons resulting from the intersection of the objects in the 2 years using the thematic change workflow tool in ENVI 93 + IDL85. This approach provides ""from-to"" information, hereafter called ""transition,"" for all polygons in the theme. We reduced noise by excluding small segments (less than 1000 m 2 ) that were a result of horizontal inconsistency between years. Landscape transitions were calculated and mapped within ENVI. | Statistical Analysis of Change Patterns: We investigated how observed land cover transitions in Somerset County were explained by two landscape characteristics, elevation and distance to shoreline, which jointly determine the expected reach of changes associated with rising sea levels. Elevation of each object within the classified images was extracted as the median elevation within the DEM of all pixels within the object, and distance was measured between the shoreline (defined as where open water and tidal creeks met any other land cover type within the 2009 classified scene) and the center of each object. We calculated the mean elevation and distance to shoreline of transition area sorted by their original land cover type (i.e. 2009), and compared them with the elevation and distance to shoreline of total area of each land cover type in 2009.
In a separate analysis using area weighted logistic regression, we statistically examined the influence of elevation, distance to shoreline, and upland land cover type on the probability of upland transition to emergent wetland. This enabled us to explicitly test whether initial upland land cover type influenced the rate of marsh migration, controlling for distance and elevation. We limited analysis to the set of objects that were classified as upland land cover (1) Forest, 2) Agricultural Land, 3) Urban Land, or 4) Scrub Shrub Wetland) in 2009. We assigned the binary response variable a value of 1 if the object had transitioned to emergent wetland by 2017 and 0 if it remained as upland in 2017. To focus on the primary region of anticipated change, we consider a focal area for our analysis that only included objects between -1 and 4 m (NAVD88) elevation and distance to shoreline of less than 2 km. We also considered an expanded analysis that incorporated the full span of predominant conditions in the We used logistic regression because our response variable (transition to emergent wetlands or not) is binary. Furthermore, because objects in our analysis were delineated as contiguous areas of uniform land cover and transition, spatial autocorrelation among objects is avoided. However, objects are non-uniform in size. As such, each observation in our data represents a different sized ""population"" of locations on the landscape (e.g. different numbers of pixels), so we weighted observations by object size to capture their differential spatial representativeness. Furthermore, we use the sandwich estimator (i.e., Huber and White) of variance to obtain standard errors that are robust to underlying heteroskedasticity. We examine variance inflation factors to ensure that multicollinearity among predictor variables is not a problem. Analyses were conducted in STATA 15.1 (StataCorp 2019), using the logit command and pweights (probability weights); predicted probability graphs were created using mgen. | Results:  | Accuracy Assessment and Description of the Study Region: The segmentation process identified a total of 109,278 and 104,974 segments in the 2009 and 2017 map areas, respectively, which ranged in area from 1 to 686,920 m 2 (see Fig. 
The most common land cover type in the study area in 2009 was forest (39.9%, or 249.23 km 2 , Fig.  | Land Cover Transitions: We found that 1651 patches comprising a total area of 16.1 km 2 , or 2.57% of the total area, transitioned during the study period (Fig. 
One of the most striking changes in the study region during this time was a loss of agricultural land. Agricultural lands were the largest source of change (38.0%) (Table 
Forest area experienced little net change during the study. Land transitioning out of forest (25.9%) approximately equaled land transitioning into forest (25.5%). Scrub shrub wetland behaved similarly; the same proportion of land transitioned out (16.1%) and into (16.5%) scrub shrub wetland. Minimal land transitioned out of urban or water during the study period (3.2 and 1.4% of the transition area, respectively) (Table  | Predictors of Land Cover Transitions: Overall, the study region was extremely low elevation, with 71% of the area at less than 2 m (NAVD88) (Fig. 
We observed a divergent pattern in land cover transitions across elevations. Transitions to emergent wetland from any land cover class occurred at low elevation (<1 m NAVD88), whereas transitions to forest from almost any land cover class occurred at higher elevation (>4 m NAVD88, high for this region) (Fig.  | Probabilities of Upland Land Use Types Converting to Emergent Wetland: Logistic regression results demonstrated that elevation is an important predictor of upland conversion to emergent wetland, with low-lying areas having higher probabilities of conversion (Table 
In our base model (<2 km from shoreline; <4 m median elevation), the VIF was highest for distance (VIF = 4.06) and the coefficient on distance was insignificant, so our preferred model excluded distance (Table  | Discussion: The land use transitions that we observed occurring over the last decade in Somerset County, Maryland are consistent with predicted marsh migration in response to sea level rise.
Emergent wetland area increased, upland area decreased, and upland to emergent wetland transitions were more likely at lower elevation and closer to shore. Importantly, we found that upland land cover type affected the likelihood of transition to emergent wetland. Transition to emergent wetland was more likely for agricultural and scrub shrub wetland areas than for urban or forest areas after controlling for elevation and distance to shore. This is the first study to demonstrate an effect of upland land cover type on marsh migration rates.
There are a number of reasons why agricultural land may be more likely than forest to transition to marsh. First, crops grown in this region, primarily corn and soy, are more sensitive to salinity and flooding than the predominant forest canopy tree in the region, the loblolly pine Pinus taeda 
Another consideration is that some land use types may exhibit more frequent and more reversible land cover transitions than others. For example, agricultural land could be taken out of production and effectively transition to emergent wetland, only to be farmed again in later years if conditions allow. Other land use types might exhibit more unidirectional change. Forest, for  Wetlands example, can subsist in the persistent zone until a single climatic event kills adult and causes a state change to marsh 
The scrub shrub wetland cover class included tidal and non-tidal freshwater swamps with low tree or shrub cover, whereas tidal and non-tidal freshwater swamps with high tree cover were classified as forest (Fig. 
The present rate of sea level rise in the study region is 4.1 mm/yr (NOAA data from 1971 to 2019, Fig. 
The changes that we observed in land cover were likely affected by this gradual increase in sea level, but additional factors cannot be dismissed in this type of analysis. Other contributors may include overtopping by storm surge or extreme tides and groundwater dynamics that affect saltwater intrusion. Surge from a single storm can salinize groundwater for months or years 
The study period also included a prolonged, extreme drought in summer 2011, with the lowest observed Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) values since 1930 and extreme drought values well below -4 during the growing season months of May, June, and July 2011 (Fig. 
Conversion of upland area to emergent wetland or open water totaled 6.1 km 2 . The largest net loss, 5.7 km 2 , was from agricultural land cover (Table  | Predictors of Land Cover Change: Interestingly, transitions from agriculture to forest exhibited a similar elevation profile to those from agriculture to emergent wetland. In our experience working in the region with farmers whose land is affected by saltwater intrusion  | Detection of Change: Our results are based on visual detection of land cover change using a supervised classification algorithm. It is likely that land cover changes which did not substantially shift the spectral signature of an area were missed by this approach. For example, agricultural land transition was only detected when the parcel's spectral signature resembled a scrub shrub wetland, forest, or emergent wetland more than agriculture. Prior to major spectral change, these lands can still visually and spectrally resemble agriculture in high resolution images (KG, personal observation). Effects such as reductions in yield due to saltwater intrusion or recent abandonment would not have been detected in this analysis. We were unable to track these subtler shifts in plant communities, or changes occurring under a forest canopy, what has been termed ""invisible migration"" 
Most prior mapping studies of marsh migration have been over centennial time scales (e.g. Smith 2013;  | Future Directions: These findings have led us in a number of directions to investigate the future of coastal land cover transitions in this region. First, we are investigating changes in cropping and land use decisions on agricultural lands to enhance understanding of the transition paths by which agricultural lands may respond to sea level rise and coastal salinization, as mediated by crop susceptibility and economic factors. In field trials, we are evaluating the suitability of transitioning agricultural lands for production of alternative crops, such as sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), and planted wetland restoration species, such as Spartina patens. We are also investigating the transition of emergent wetlands to open water during marsh pond expansion  | Wetlands:  | Conclusion: We report rapid rates of marsh migration and upland conversion in a low-lying tidally dissected county in Maryland. Agricultural land and scrub shrub wetland were more able to conversion to emergent wetland than forest or urban land, after controlling for two important variables in land use transition, elevation and distance to shore. Questions remain about the proximate social, landscape, and climate drivers responsible for this greater vulnerability; these will be the subject of future research. Further insight into variables influencing coastal change can guide the development of policies and land management efforts to promote coastal resilience and improve predictive models of land cover change on the coast.","A land use and land cover classification system for use with remote sensor data (, 1976) || Upslope development of a tidal marsh as a function of upland land use (, , , 2017) || Salt marsh migration into lawns revealed by a novel sediment-based approach (, , , , 2019) || Evaluating the effects of land-use change and future climate change on vulnerability of coastal landscapes to saltwater intrusion (, , , , , , , , , 2018a) || Seekamp EL (2018b) Sea level rise impacts on rural coastal social-ecological systems and the implications for decision making (, , , , , , , , ) || Sea-level rise: projections for Maryland (, , , 2018. 2018) || Nonlinear change in sea level observed at north American tide stations (, , 2015) || Ecology of tidal freshwater forests in coastal deltaic Louisiana and northeastern South Carolina.

Landsat Analysis Ready Data for Global Land Cover and Land Cover Change Mapping,Peter Potapov; Matthew Hansen; Indrani Kommareddy; Anil Kommareddy; Svetlana Turubanova; Amy Pickens; Bernard Adusei; Alexandra Tyukavina; Qing Ying,"The multi-decadal Landsat data record is a unique tool for global land cover and land use change analysis. However, the large volume of the Landsat image archive and inconsistent coverage of clear-sky observations hamper land cover monitoring at large geographic extent. Here, we present a consistently processed and temporally aggregated Landsat Analysis Ready Data produced by the Global Land Analysis and Discovery team at the University of Maryland (GLAD ARD) suitable for national to global empirical land cover mapping and change detection. The GLAD ARD represent a 16-day time-series of tiled Landsat normalized surface reflectance from 1997 to present, updated annually, and designed for land cover monitoring at global to local scales. A set of tools for multi-temporal data processing and characterization using machine learning provided with GLAD ARD serves as an end-to-end solution for Landsat-based natural resource assessment and monitoring. The GLAD ARD data and tools have been implemented at the national, regional, and global extent for water, forest, and crop mapping. The GLAD ARD data and tools are available at the GLAD website for free access.","Introduction: The joint National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat program, which started in the early 1970s, provides the longest continuous global archive of the satellite earth observation data. Since the launch of 
The methods for globally consistent, multi-temporal land cover characterization and change detection were developed in the late 1990s-early 2000s using the low spatial resolution data from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 
Landsat imagery is available globally as Level 1 data (geometrically corrected data processed to sensor units) from the USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science Center (USGS EROS). The Level 2 (surface reflectance) data are available on request. The lack of Landsat Level 3 products requires users to develop and implement custom solutions for spatial and temporal data aggregation. Several initiatives are aimed to create a consistent ARD data products from the Landsat data archive, including Web-enabled Landsat Data (WELD) 
The Global Land Analysis and Discovery (GLAD) team at the University of Maryland has developed and implemented an automated Landsat data processing system that generates globally consistent analysis ready data (GLAD ARD) as inputs for land cover and land use mapping and change analysis. The data processing algorithms were developed by Hansen et al.  | The GLAD ARD Methodology:  | Landsat Image Processing:  | Image Selection: We employ the archive of Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI/TIRS data collected from the year 1997 to present available from the USGS EROS Data Center (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/). The Landsat Collection 1 Level 1 data are organized into three categories (tiers): Tier 1, Tier 2, and Real-Time 
The purpose of the ARD is to map land cover and land use during the growing season, hence images affected by seasonal snow cover are excluded from processing. The seasonal snow cover was analyzed using the MODIS/Terra Snow Cover Monthly L3 Global product (https://nsidc.org/data/MOD10CM/versions/6) and Landsat imagery. We excluded all 16-day intervals (see section 2.1.5) that feature seasonal snow cover. The snow-free window duration (Figure 
Almost 3 million images (2,984,860) from 1 January 1997, to 31 October 2019, were selected and processed to create the global ARD. The annual image count (Figure 
The Tier 1 data delivered as precision and terrain corrected products (L1TP) with image-toimage registration Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of or below 12 meters  | Conversion to Radiometric Quantity: Due to the differences in spectral band configuration between Landsat sensors, only spectral bands with matching wavelengths between TM, ETM+, and OLI/TIRS sensors are processed (Table 
Landsat Collection 1 data contain radiation measurements for reflective visible/infrared bands in the form of scaled reflectance (OLI) or radiance (TM/ETM+) recorded as integer digital numbers (DNs) 
For the TM and ETM+ data, we use the TOA conversion methods and coefficients from 
œÅ -scaled TOA reflectance; œÄ -pi constant; d -Earth-Sun distance; G -gain factor; DNoriginal digital number; B -bias factor; ESUN -mean exoatmospheric solar irradiance; sunelev -solar elevation angle. Parameters d, G, B, and ESUN are taken from 
Parameter sunelev comes from the image metadata.
The OLI data are provided as TOA reflectance without solar zenith correction. We apply Equation 2 to perform the correction for the incoming solar radiation angle. œÅ=(0.0002√óDN+0.1)/(sin(sunelev√óœÄ/180)) √ó 40,000

Parameters G, B, K1, and K2 are taken from  | Observation Quality Assessment: The per-pixel observation quality assessment is used to highlight observations with a high probability of atmospheric contamination by clouds, haze, or cloud shadows. In addition, observation quality assessment performs generic snow/ice and water mapping. Observation quality assessment is based on the aggregation of the Landsat quality assessment band and GLAD quality assessment model output.
The Landsat Collection 1 data include a Quality Assessment (QA) band based on the globally consistent CFMask cloud and cloud shadow detection algorithm 
The GLAD observation quality assessment model developed by our team represents a set of regionally adapted decision tree ensembles 
A comparison of the GLAD and CFMask cloud and cloud shadow detection results in Southeast Asia (Table 
For the Landsat 5 TM sensor, we applied an additional observation quality check to remove sensor errors. Specifically, we excluded observations which have incorrect (usually, abnormally low) radiance measurements for selected bands. We assigned a ""no data"" flag to all pixels that have DN values for visible and NIR bands below 7 (empirically derived threshold). For Landsat 5 data from the years 2001 and 2002, when most of the sensor anomalies were detected, an image was removed from ARD processing if it contained more than 10,000 of such pixels. | Reflectance Normalization: Reflectance normalization is a required step that allows extrapolation of the image characterization models in time and space by ensuring spectral similarity of the same land-cover types. Normalization addresses several factors that affect surface reflectance measurement from space, including scattering and attenuation of radiation passing through the atmosphere, and surface anisotropy. We implemented a relative normalization procedure 
(2) Pseudo-Invariant Objects
The mask of pseudo-invariant objects is derived automatically and used to calibrate the perscene surface reflectance normalization model. The mask includes clear-sky land observations (pixels) that represent the same land cover type and phenology stage in the Landsat image and MODIS normalization target composite. Water and snow/ice observations are excluded from the mask due to different properties of surface anisotropy. To select the pseudo-invariant pixels, we first exclude all observations except clear-sky land using the scene QF. Second, we calculate the absolute difference between Landsat and MODIS spectral reflectance for red and shortwave infrared bands. Only pixels with differences below 0.1 reflectance value for both spectral bands qualify for the pseudo-invariant mask. Bright objects (with red band reflectance above 0.5) are excluded from the mask. To avoid reflectance normalization artifacts due to insufficient calibration data, Landsat images with less than 10,000 pseudo-invariant pixels are discarded from the processing chain.
( | 3) Model Parametrization: To parametrize the reflectance normalization model, we calculate the bias between Landsat TOA reflectance and MODIS surface reflectance for each spectral band within the mask of pseudoinvariant objects. We collect per-band median bias for each 10 km interval of distance from the Landsat ground track. The set of median values is used to parametrize a per-band linear regression model using least squares fitting method. For each image and each spectral band, we derive gain (G) and bias (B) coefficients to predict the reflectance bias as a function of the distance from the ground track (Equation  | ŒîœÅ=G√ód+B (4): ŒîœÅ -reflectance bias; G -gain factor; d -distance from the Landsat ground track; B -bias factor.
Figure 
œÅ NORM -normalized surface reflectance; œÅ TOA -TOA reflectance; G -gain factor; d -distance from the Landsat ground track; B -bias factor. GLAD ARD normalized surface reflectance is highly correlated to the MODIS surface reflectance data used for normalization model parametrization (Figure  | Temporal Integration and Tiling: The final step of the GLAD ARD processing is a temporal aggregation of individual Landsat images into 16-day composites. The compositing interval was selected corresponding to the Landsat orbital cycle and the MODIS Level 3 data products  | GLAD ARD Structure:  | Global Tile System: The GLAD ARD tile system was developed to simplify global data handling. The geographic coordinates using the World Geodetic System (WGS84) were selected as the most universal way of sharing global data. The coordinate system is defined by EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset as EPSG:4326 (https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84/), or using PROJ standard (http://proj.org) as +proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs. The nearest neighbor resampling may be used to re-project the geographic data into the original Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Landsat pixel grid without distortion, assuming that the output UTM zone is the same as for the source Collection 1 Landsat imagery.
The spatial resolution of the ARD dataset is 0.00025 degree per pixel, which corresponds to 27.83 m per pixel on the Equator. The pixel size is a compromise between the need to preserve the original Landsat data pixel size (30 m/pixel) and to avoid using a repeating decimal number for pixel size (which may cause problems with georeference precision).
The ARD product is stored in 1 √ó 1 geographic degrees tiles. The tile format facilitates data handling and the parallelization of data processing. The exact 1 √ó 1 degree tile format, however, is not optimal for contextual analysis when neighboring pixels are located on different tiles. We implemented a partial solution to this issue by creating a tile system with a 2-pixel overlap. The actual ARD tile size is 4004 √ó 4004 pixels, an extent of 1.0005 by 1.0005 degrees. The 2-pixel buffer allows implementing contextual analyses using 3 √ó 3 and 5 √ó 5 kernels without the need to read data from multiple tiles at a time.
Tile names are derived from the tile center, and refer to the integer value of degrees. E.g., the name of a tile with center 17.5E and 52.5N is 017E_52N. The ARD product is only generated for tiles that include ice-free land area and where Landsat Tier 1 data exist (Figure  | 16-Day Composite Data: Each data granule contains observations collected during a single 16-day interval. There are 23 intervals per year (see Table 
ID -interval identification number (file name), Year -selected year (1980 and later), Interval -selected annual 16-day interval .
The 16-day data for a tile are stored as 8-band, 16-bit unsigned, LZW-compressed GeoTIFF files. The list of image bands is provided in Table  | Multi-Temporal Metrics: Despite the global radiometric consistency of the 16-day GLAD ARD product, direct application of this dataset as input to a land cover characterization model is hampered by the irregular frequency of clear-sky observation. The availability of clear-sky observations is a function of the Landsat orbital constellation, data acquisition strategy, and cloud cover. As a result, annual 16-day time-series for the same area may have dramatically different numbers of clear-sky observations between seasons and years 
The multi-temporal metrics method is a time-series data transformation that improves spatial and temporal consistency, simplifies phenological analysis, and facilitates land cover mapping and change detection at large geographic extents. The metrics approach helps to overcome the inconsistency of clear-sky data availability that is typical for sensors with low observation frequency, such as Landsat. The metrics method was developed in the mid-1980s to extract phenological features from the AVHRR-based NDVI time-series  | Annual Phenological Metrics: The annual phenological metrics serve as source data for land cover, land use, and vegetation structure mapping models. Metrics represent a set of statistics extracted from the normalized surface reflectance time-series within a corresponding calendar year (January 1 -December 31). However, limited and inconsistent data availability in regions with a short snow-free season or frequent cloud cover may preclude consistent phenology characterization by annual observation time-series. To fill long gaps in observation time-series we use the data from the three previous years. Optionally, the gap-filling algorithm can be disabled to create metrics solely from data collected during the corresponding year. The process of phenological metrics processing includes two stages: (1) selecting clear-sky observations and filling gaps in the observation time-series; and (2) extracting reflectance distribution statistics from the time-series of selected observations. First, we compile a gap-filled time-series of annual observations with the lowest atmospheric contamination (Figure 
NR AB -Normalized ratio between bands A and B; œÅ A , œÅ B -normalized surface reflectance of bands A and B.

SVVI -Spectral variability vegetation index; œÉ -standard deviation; œÅ Blue , etc. -normalized surface reflectance.
Multi-temporal metrics are generated from the time-series using two observation date ranking approaches (Figure  | Annual Change Detection Metrics: To extract statistics, we use three different approaches (Figure 
Observations in each time-series are ranked by (a) spectral band or index value, and (b) corresponding NDVI and brightness temperature values. Similar to phenological metrics, we record selected ranks and average between ranks for each spectral variable. ÔÇ∑ The time-series I is used to analyze unidirectional trend of spectral reflectance within a two-years interval. We use least squares method to fit linear regression model that predicts spectral reflectance or index value from the observation date (date range is from 1 to 46) for clear-sky observations. We record the slope of linear regression as a metric value. In addition, we calculate and record standard deviation of spectral variable within the time-series I. ÔÇ∑ The time-series D consists of per-16-day interval spectral reflectance or index differences. We rank difference values, and extract a set of statistics (selected ranks and averages) from these ranking.  The high variability of metrics allows using the generic change detection metric set for the wide spectrum of land cover monitoring applications. Annual metrics for the corresponding and preceding years (Figure 
Annual change detection metrics serve the operational update of the global forest cover change product that is developed by the GLAD team for Global Forest Watch initiative (www. globalforestwatch.org). The data users should be aware that while using four years of data to create a change detection metrics set improves the classification quality, the metric set is sensitive to changes that happened not only between the corresponding and preceding years, but also between the corresponding year and the years i-2 and i-3. The ""last annual observation"" metric may be used to exclude changes that happened earlier. Alternatively, a change detection algorithm can be applied annually to eliminate redundant change detections. | Known Issues and Limitations: The GLAD team is constantly updating the ARD product to ensure data completeness and quality. Here, we list known issues that users should consider when using the product. Some of these issues will be addressed in future revisions of the GLAD ARD. ÔÇ∑ The current version of the GLAD ARD product is not suitable for real-time land cover monitoring.
The ARD product rely on Tier 1 data which currently features up to 26 days processing delay by USGS (https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat/landsat-collection-1). A 16-day interval data are processed only after all daily data are available as Tier 1. Thus, the ARD update usually features a 1-month delay. ÔÇ∑ Landsat 5 images for 2001-2002 were filtered for possible sensor artifacts during ARD processing.
However, after examining images recently processed to Collection 1 standard we suggested that some of these artifacts were removed by the data provider. A re-processing of the year 2001 and 2002 ARD will be scheduled to include corrected L5 data. ÔÇ∑ Images crossing the 180¬∞ meridian were not processed due to technical difficulties. This issue was not addressed yet due to low demand for the data in these regions. The images will be processed and the corresponding 16-day composites will be updated later. ÔÇ∑ Due to low sun azimuth and similarity between snow cover and clouds during winter season in temperate and boreal climates, the GLAD Landsat ARD algorithm is not suitable for winter time image processing above 30N and below 45S Latitude. We are not processing images during times affected by seasonal snow cover so the resulting 16-day intervals have no data. Some of the images (and resulting 16-day composites) may still include snow-covered observations. We suggest further filtering such observations using the ""snow/ice"" observation quality flag or by removing certain 16-day intervals from data processing. ÔÇ∑ The surface reflectance normalization is not equal to a physically-based atmospheric and surface anisotropy correction. While the comparison of ARD data with MODIS-based surface reflectance and successful ARD applications for global land cover mapping suggest that the product has sufficient quality for intended use, the ARD data may not be suitable for precise analysis of land surface reflectance. ÔÇ∑ Users should be aware that the image normalization method is not designed to deal with specular reflectance and thus introduces bias over the water surfaces. We do not recommend using the ARD product for water quality assessment or any other hydrology applications beyond surface water extent mapping.

Land use land cover change and the resilience of social-ecological systems in a sub-region in South west Cameroon,Ewane Ewane,"LULCC and magnitude of impact of the drivers and predictors of LULCC in the sub-region by engag-| ing 25 stakeholders in a focus group survey. Other cultivated areas of cropland, built-up, oil palm, and banana plantation covers increased by 21,360 ha (10.5%), 3152 ha (1.6%), 5721 ha (2.8%), and 1823 ha (0.9%), while dense forest, rubber and tea plantation covers decreased by -44,945 ha (-22.1%), -15,557 ha (-7.7%), and -110 ha (-0.1%), respectively, from 1986 to 2018. Most of the deforestation and LULCC was caused by expansion of other cultivated areas of cropland by smallholders, contrary to the widely publicised narrative of agro-industrial and built-up areas expansion. The spatial pattern of LULCC showed that expansion of other cultivated areas of cropland and agro-industrial plantations were highest in the north and east zones, respectively, while expansion of builtup areas and decrease in agro-industrial plantation covers were highest in the central, south and western coastal zones of Fako division. The variations in the spatial patterns of LULCC between the sub-divisions are attributed to differences in rates of population growth and urbanisation, topography, size of farming population, proportion of cultivable land, socioeconomic opportunities, and strength and resilience of Abstract The old paradigm of horizontal expansion of agricultural land and built-up areas over highland and lowland ecosystems remains highly prevalent in Cameroon, causing significant changes in LULC and undermining the resilience and sustainability of social-ecological systems.

In addition, we explored the likelihood of Highlights ‚Ä¢ Most of the deforestation and LULCC was caused by expansion of other cultivated areas of cropland by smallholders, contrary to the widely publicised narrative of agro-industrial plantation and built-up area expansion from 1986 to 2018. ‚Ä¢ Dense forest and rubber plantation covers decreased, while oil palm and banana plantation covers increased, owing to local economics and increase in local and international palm oil demand. ‚Ä¢ Spatial patterns of change in LULC classes were highly variable within the sub-region, but common temporal trends in LULCC were observed on the most part. ‚Ä¢ Differences in biophysical and socio-economic factors explained the variability in the spatial patterns of LULCC among sub-divisions. ‚Ä¢ Changes in LULC decreased with elevation, but increased with nearness to the sea and national road networks.","Introduction: Holistically, landscape as a geographical area is characterised by its biophysical contents of observable, natural, and human-induced characteristics, including ecosystem type and socio-cultural relations to areas at different spatial scales 
Decision-making in land use land cover change (LULCC) can be explained, to a large extent, by the socio-economic, climatic, and soil conditions of a location 
SES are integrated complex and adaptive systems, in which social and ecological sub-systems are coupled and interdependent, each a function of the other, expressed in a series of mutual feedback relationships 
Landscapes and their ecosystems are influenced by the institutions that govern their use and by the indigenous communities dependent on the forest resources 
The spatio-temporal patterns, processes, and causes of LULCC are still not well understood in land system science 
The old paradigm of horizontal expansion of agricultural land and built-up areas over highland and lowland ecosystems remains the norm in Cameroon, causing significant changes in LULC and undermining the resilience and sustainability of SES along its western highland region, where the study area of Fako division is located. The biophysical landscape of the study area is composed of important lowland agricultural estates, mountain forests, and coastal mangrove ecological systems across its five sub-divisions, which are undergoing increasing transformation. In this study, the concept of SES was used to understand human-environment interactions and outcome, while that of LULCC was used to understand the spatio-temporal patterns and processes of change related to biophysical and socio-economic factors in Fako division from 1986 to 2018. 
The main objective of this study is to explore LULCC and expert stakeholder perceptions of changing SES in Fako division, South west region of Cameroon. Specifically, the study aims  | Methods:  | Study area: The study area is Fako division (Fig. 
The sub-region falls within the tropical rainforest zone with an equatorial monsoon climate. Annual rainfall ranges from 2000 to 4000 mm, attributed to the effect of the forested Mount Cameroon (4095 m above sea level), which intercepts wet air masses and its proximity to the Atlantic Coast of Cameroon. The highest rainfall comes between July and September with monthly amounts ranging from 400 to 500 mm, particularly in Limbe, Buea, and West Coast sub-divisions, with the latter receiving even higher monthly and annual rainfall. The high annual rainfall and historical volcanic eruption of lava and ash contributes to the very high soil fertility in the sub-region, which is highly exploited for small-, medium-, and large-scale agricultural production activities. The sub-region presents the best example of historically human-induced progressive conversion and changes in lowland dense forest and grassland cover in Cameroon, predominantly for plantation agriculture, a legacy of German colonial administration. Current urban sprawl dominated by housing development and expanding arable cropland and agro-industrial plantations in peri-urban areas are significantly transforming the landscape and producing varied social-ecological systems in Fako Division. | Data sources:  | Land use land cover data: A combination of Multispectral Scanner 3 (MSS), Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus 7 (ETM +), and Landsat Operational Land Imager 8 (OLI) was used to obtain the LULC and LULCC data of Fako division, in the South west region of Cameroon (http:// glovis. usgs. gov/), supplemented with Google Earth Imagery data. Details of the methods of LULCC data collection and the general procedure for acquisition of the LULC maps and classification of LULC classes can be found in 
The study is based on the biophysical landscape characterisation approach using statistical analyses to obtain LULC data in order to identify gradients of variation in the presence and /or abundance of landscape diversity 
The study used two LULC maps of Fako division for the period 1986 (Fig.  | Focus group survey data: This exploratory study followed a stakeholder-driven scenario development during multi-stakeholder questionnaire administration in focus group discussion sessions held in Buea, headquarter of Fako division. Focus group survey is a form of group interview that capitalises on communication and deliberation between participants to generate data based on a group consensus 
Stakeholders play an important role in scenario analysis, especially for assessing and modelling future LULCC and their possible impacts 
The identification and selection of participants for the stakeholder focus group interview took into consideration the participant's knowledge of evolving land uses, their drivers, and indicators, and demonstrated interest, willingness, and readiness in local knowledge sharing and collaborative learning. The survey method involved the selection of economic sectors and development of qualitative and semiquantitative sector trajectories; assessing the likelihood of LULCC, identifying the drivers, indicators, and the spatial patterns. In the stakeholder scenario analysis, we used the business as usual scenario (BUS) and green economy scenario (GES). In the BUS, continuous expansion of human degradation activities such as land use conversion to agricultural uses impacts forests, woodland, and wetlands, with no productivity gain expected. In the GES, decreasing deforestation and degradation with increasing productivity and implementation of payment for ecosystem service schemes is envisaged 
In this study, we identified 8 socio-economic drivers of LULCC specific to Cameroon, including population growth, agricultural and cropland expansion, biomass energy (fuelwood and charcoal) exploitation, livestock grazing, commercial logging/timber exploitation (legal and illegal), bushfires (human-set fire), infrastructural development, and mining expansion. All the 25 participants in the focus groups were presented with these socio-economic sectors most relevant to local livelihoods and national economy. It is invaluable to define a representation of the proximate and most important groups of drivers and underlying causes of deforestation and LULCC 
During the focus groups, participants were encouraged to use information such as specific sites of potential LULCC such as administrative units or gazetted sites, or biophysical factors associated with them such as nearness to mountain, sea and national road network, proportion of cultivable land, endemism, conservation attraction, size of farm labour, and business growth attractions, among others, in the ranking exercises. The stakeholders discussed their different perspectives to generate consensus and harmonise visions within each sub-division and in the sub-region. Each expert focus group discussion session was led by a facilitator, who took notes and ensure a collective understanding of the objectives, without actively participating in the discussion. The structured questions were designed to explore expert stakeholder observations, perceptions, and future scenarios of either continuous resource degradation or improved resource governance, sustainable land use planning and green economy development based on the current activities and practices in the sub-region. | Data analysis: Quantitative analyses for LULCC assessment statistics and understanding of evolving spatial patterns and trajectories in the sub-region from 1986 to 2018 were performed using ArcGIS 10.2. Data on the likelihood for potential changes from one LULC class to another in each of the sub-divisions was analysed using a likelihood probability ratio scale to locate the points of similarity or dissimilarity of variables within the sub-divisions and sub-region. We used the likelihood probability ratio scale of 0.95-1.0 (Extremely likely), 0.9-1.0 (Very likely), 0.66-1.0 (Likely), 0.50-1.0 (Possible), 0.33-1.0 (Unlikely), 0.10-1.0 (Very unlikely), and 0.05-1.0 (Extremely unlikely). This vulnerability or likelihood scale enabled stakeholders to deliberate and negotiate uncertainty and confidence intervals of variables in the LULCC and scenario analysis framework. Data from stakeholder ranking of the drivers and indicators of LULCC under the BUS and GES were also analysed using radar charts while statistically significant differences in the stakeholder perceptions ranking across the five sub-divisions was detected using Friedman test statistics in XLSTAT version 2020. In a radar chart, the data length of a spoke is proportional to the magnitude of the variable for the data point starting from a center point of 0.0 relative to the maximum magnitude point of 1.0 of the variable across all the data points  | Results:  | Spatial distribution of land use land cover change assessment: The spatial distribution of LULCC among the five sub-divisions in the sub-region showed appreciable spatial and temporal variability but with somehow similar trends from 1986 to 2018 (Appendix 1). In Buea sub-division, dense forest cover decreased from 25,937 to 12,736 ha (-50.9%), that is, by 22.3% of the total land surface area, and at an annual rate of 0.7% (Table 
In Limbe sub-division, dense forest cover decreased from 12,675 to 9818 ha (-22.5%), that is, by 11.76% of the total land surface area, and at an average annual rate of 0.37% from 1986 to 2018 (Table 
In Tiko sub-division, dense forest cover decreased from 16,221 to 5179 ha (-68.1%), that is, by 23.8% of the total land surface area, and at an average annual rate of 0.67% from 1986 to 2018 (Table 
In Muyuka sub-division, dense forest cover decreased from 29,618 to 6859 ha (-76.8%), that is, by 47.4% of the total land surface area, and at an average annual rate of 1.48% from 1986 to 2018 (Table 
In West Coast sub-division, dense forest decreased from 17,565 to 6232 ha (-64.5%), that is, by 46.1% of the total land surface area, at an average annual rate of 1.44% from 1986 to 2018 (Table 
For LULCC at the sub-regional scale, mangrove forest, grassland, and montane forest increased from 14,971 to 20,155 ha (2.55%), 9062 to 9686 ha (0.31%), and 2795 to 28,733 ha (12.8%), respectively, from 1986 to 2018 (Table 
Under the GES analysis, sustainable land management (e.g. adequate master and land use plans), good governance (e.g. law enforcement, capacity building, community awareness), conservation (e.g. creation of protected areas, community forest, council forest), and afforestation and reforestation (ecosystem restoration initiatives) were ranked as the most important measures towards LULCC reduction in all the subdivisions. On the other hand, sustainable forest management (good practices, access, and equity in benefit sharing), incentives (payment for ecosystem services to smallholders and communities), and technological improvement (improved stoves, alternative energy sources) were ranked as the lowest impact measures towards LULCC reduction under GES in the subdivisions (Fig. 
Furthermore, the expert stakeholders ranked the indicators of the socio-economic drivers of LULCC under the BUS and GES and the results were similar on the most part, with only small variations in the order of the ranking of the indicators among the subdivisions (Figs. 
The likelihood of a potential change from one LULC to another was envisaged to be highest for mangrove forest, oil palm plantation, banana planation, water, dense forest, and other cultivated areas in Buea subdivision (Fig. 
The spatial pattern of degradation of LULC under the BUS in the future is presented in Fig. 
The spatial pattern of degradation of LULC under the GES in the future is presented in Fig.  | Discussion: In the 1980s, landscape transformation in the study area was mainly dominated by conversion of lowland dense forest and grassland to agro-industrial plantations in a time of low population growth and low land and food demand, thus producing more resilient and adaptable SES. In the 2000s, the historical hot zones for agro-industrial plantations that were initial sites of rapid dense forest cover conversion became attractive sites for conversion to built-up areas and other cultivated areas of cropland in the sub-region, following increased population growth and high land and food demand, thus producing less resilient and adaptable SES. The spatial pattern of LULCC show some appreciable common decreasing trends in dense forest cover in all the five sub-divisions, with the decrease ranging from 11.76 to 47.4% from 1986 to 2018. The increased LULCC from the year 2000 are associated with the dwindling resilience and adaptability of SES in areas closer to the sea and national road networks in the sub-region, where social systems such as student villages, residential suburbs, migrant settlements, and farming and fishing village communities have developed and expanded at the detriment of ecological systems such as lowland forests, grassland and mangroves. Consistent with this result, forest cover loss showed increasing trends in four community forests in Fako division from 2001 to 2018, due to mainly to agricultural expansion, illegal exploitation of wood and non-wood products, and weak governance 
The decrease in rubber plantation cover, ranging from 1.08 to 13.2% across all the sub-divisions, is indicative of changing global commodity consumption patterns and falling commodity product prices in the export market, consistent with the observations of 
The population of Fako division has almost doubled over the last 30 years, that is, from 248,032 inhabitants in 1987 to 466,412 inhabitants in 2005 with a growth rate of 4.89, compared to a national average of 2.59%. Urban sprawl remains the dominant and widely prevailing form of urban growth in the sub-region. The observed significant differences in the increase of built-up areas between the sub-divisions are attributable to differences in population growth, socio-economic attractions, and strength and resilience of the local economy. Buea and Limbe sub-divisions have higher population growth rates (> 4.5% compared to 2.59% national average), urbanisation rate, socio-economic attractions, business growth rate, and traffic density than Tiko, Muyuka, and West Coast sub-divisions with significantly more agrarian local economy. Beyond 2000, much of the expansion in built-up areas and other cultivated areas of cropland occurred more in non-forest than forest areas in Buea and Limbe subdivisions, leading to a decrease in the area cover of agro-industrial plantations. Built-up land expansion due to urban growth usually occurs at the expense of ecological land cover classes in many developing countries 
In addition, the rapid population growth is causing high land value and increasing competition for farmland, leading to increased food prices, and threatening food security in Buea and Limbe sub-divisions. In particular, the rapid population growth rate due mainly to migration is triggering unprecedented progressive land tenure change from public land tenure to customary tenure and private land ownership since the 2000s to meet up with the increasing land demand for housing and farmland development. The wellintended government development strategy of land redistribution (land reform) has increased land and land use conflict, systematic land grabbing by local elites, wealthy business owners and decentralised government administrators, and exacerbated forest clearing and land use conversion for personal gains, consistent with the results of 
The old paradigm of horizontal expansion of smallholder cultivated areas of cropland and agro-industrial (including non-industrial oil palm) plantations remains the main form of agricultural growth in the sub-region. It occurs in both non-forest and dense forest areas, mostly in West Coast, Muyuka, and Tiko sub-divisions of the sub-region, with higher farming population and poorer socio-economic development. Smallholder land use decision-making in terms of survivalist, subsistence-oriented, and market-oriented types are more likely found in areas with higher poverty levels and overall lower levels of socio-economic development 
Results on the spatial distribution of LULCC in the sub-region indicated dense forest cover and other cultivated areas of cropland, respectively, decreased and increased the highest in the Northern and Eastern zones, located in Muyuka (-47.4% and 16.2%) and Tiko (-23.8% and 11.9%) sub-divisions from 1986 to 2018. In both sub-divisions, the topography is relatively low-lying, high farming population, and large proportion of cultivable land favoured the conversion of dense forest to cocoa, arable cropland, and agro-industrial plantations. In the northern zone, the on-going armed conflict in Anglophone Cameroon is causing more and more people to seek semi-permanent refuge in the forests, clearing more forest land to expand farmland and semi-permanent settlements. In general, the lowland ecological systems in the subregion experienced tremendous transformation due to greater vulnerability to overwhelming human pressure, undermining their resilience and sustainability. The lowland dense forest and grassland covers were converted to other land uses, mainly other cultivated areas (10.51%), oil palm (2.82%), banana (0.92%) plantations, and built-up areas (1.6%). In the lowland ecological systems, LULCC mostly increased with nearness to the Atlantic Coastline and settlements, and along national road networks and major markets linking main cities, towns, and villages in the sub-region, emphasising the vulnerability of lowland and coastalland boundary ecosystems. Consistent with this study results, 
On the other hand, the conversion of dense forest to other land uses was lower (-13,201 ha and -22.3%) in the mountain ecological systems in Buea sub-division, indicating their greater resilience to human-induced change relating to deforestation and forest degradation, and lesser vulnerability to agricultural expansion activities compared to lowland areas of Muyuka and Tiko sub-divisions. The results confirm the hypothesis that LULCC decreased with increase in elevation of Mount Cameroon (4095 m), a biophysical barrier in the northwest zone, emphasising the resilience of the mountain ecosystem in the sub-region. 
The stakeholder groups successfully ranked the drivers and indicators of LULCC under the BUS and GES despite the technical complexity of the questionnaire, thanks to the higher education level, academic and professional background, and technical experience. Under the BUS, the expert stakeholders emphasised that population growth, agricultural land expansion, infrastructural development, and biomass energy exploitation (fuelwood and charcoal), respectively, are the key drivers of increased LULCC in the sub-region. This is consistent with the findings of  | 338: Page 20 of 23
The expansion of agricultural and croplands is consistent with government policy encouraging more youths to engage in agriculture as a means of employment, with the aim of increasing national GDP from export earnings, food security, nutrition diversity, household income, and local economic resilience. This is consistent with reports that arable production in Cameroon is declining or stagnating, and the situation is pushing more people to facing the problems of food insecurity 
The expert stakeholders ranked sustainable land management, good governance, conservation, and reforestation, respectively, as the highest impact drivers and predictors of green economy development, with only small variations in stakeholder perceptions between the sub-divisions. Consistent with this result, 
The stakeholders emphasised that population growth and sustainable land management, respectively, are the main drivers of increased and decreased degradation under the BUS and GES in the subregion. Population growth drives expansion in oil palm plantations at small scale, while national agricultural development plan triggers expansion of agroindustrial plantations at large spatial scales in the subregion  | Conclusion: Natural vegetation landscapes are undergoing significant human transformations, causing significant alterations of ecosystem services and functions, and undermining the resilience and sustainability of SES. We analysed satellite imagery of 1986 and 2018 to examine the extent and spatial patterns of LULCC and validated current and future LULCC scenarios with expert multi-stakeholder perceptions in five subdivisions of Fako division of Cameroon. The increase in other cultivated areas of cropland, oil palm plantations and built-up areas, and decrease in dense forest and rubber plantation covers dominated the LULCC in the sub-region from 1986 to 2018. However, most of the deforestation and LULCC was caused by expansion of other cultivated areas of cropland by smallholders, contrary to the widely publicised narrative of agro-industrial and built-up areas expansion. Expansion of other cultivated areas of cropland, oil palm, and banana plantations were highest in the northern and eastern zones located in Muyuka and Tiko sub-divisions, respectively. The low-lying topography, higher proportion of cultivable land, farm labour, and predominantly agrarian local economy favoured horizontal agricultural land expansion more in the northern and eastern zones of the subregion. The increase in built-up areas was highest in Page 21 of 23 338 the central, south, and western coastal zones due to rapid population growth, unregulated urbanisation, and better socio-economic opportunities in Buea and Limbe sub-divisions. Due to the rapid unregulated urbanisation, urban sprawl was the dominant mode of urban growth in the sub-region. Rubber plantations and lowland dense forest are extremely vulnerable to degradation based on the economics of changing commodity market prices. Oil palm and banana plantations, mangrove, and montane forests showed appreciable resilience to human transformation activities in the sub-region. Population growth, agricultural and farmland expansion, and infrastructural development were ranked as the three most important drivers of degradation under the BUS, while sustainable land management, good governance, and afforestation/reforestation were ranked as the three most important predictors of LULCC reduction under the GES. LULCC decreased with increase in elevation of Mount Cameroon (4095 m) in the northwest zone, but increased with nearness to the Atlantic Coast in the western zone and national road networks, emphasising the resilience of the mountain ecosystem and the vulnerability of lowland and coastal-land boundary ecosystems. The west and south facing slopes of Mount Cameroon harbours high value forests with high endemism and conservation attractiveness, and remains a key biodiversity hot spot, watershed providing clean water, healthy soil and regulating the climate in the central Africa sub-region and beyond. In general, production and living land covers significantly increased at the expense of ecological land covers. Therefore, increasing the legal protection of the mountain and coastal land-boundary ecological systems while providing for production and living land is invaluable for the sustainability of ecosystem functions and services in the western highland region of Cameroon and in the rainforest-rich Congo Basin.","Urbanization, land use transformation and spatioenvironmental impacts: Analyses of trends and implications in major metropolitan regions of Ghana (, , , , , , , , 2020) || Shifting patterns of oil palm driven deforestation in Indonesia and implications for zero-deforestation commitments (, , , , , , 2017) || The impact of urbanization on agricultural dynamics: A case study in Belgium (, , , , 2020. 17692) || Environmental governance for the Anthropocene?

"Drivers and Implications of Land Use/Land Cover Dynamics in Finchaa Catchment, Northwestern Ethiopia",Wakjira Takala Dibaba; Tamene Demissie; Konrad Miegel,"Understanding the trajectories and extents of land use/land cover change (LULCC) is important to generate and provide helpful information to policymakers and development practitioners about the magnitude and trends of LULCC. This study presents the contributing factors of LULCC, the extent and implications of these changes for sustainable land use in the Finchaa catchment. Data from Landsat images 1987Landsat images  , 2002Landsat images  , and 2017   were used to develop the land use maps and quantify the changes. A supervised classification with the maximum likelihood classifier was used to classify the images. Key informant interviews and focused group discussions with transect walks were used for the socio-economic survey. Over the past three decades, agricultural land, commercial farm, built-up, and water bodies have increased while forestland, rangeland, grazing land, and swampy areas have decreased. Intensive agriculture without proper management practice has been a common problem of the catchment. Increased cultivation of steep slopes has increased the risk of erosion and sedimentation of nearby water bodies. Multiple factors, such as biophysical, socio-economic, institutional, technological, and demographic, contributed to the observed LULCC in the study area. A decline in agricultural yield, loss of biodiversity, extended aridity and drought, land and soil degradation, and decline of water resources are the major consequences of LULCC in the Finchaa catchment. The socio-economic developments and population growth have amplified the prolonged discrepancy between supply and demand for land and water in the catchment. More comprehensive and integrated watershed management policies will be indispensable to manage the risks.","Introduction: Land use/land cover change (LULCC) is among the major factors that affect biophysical systems at all scales 
In the past, recognition of the importance of the natural environment for human well-being has been less influential in maintaining sustainable development and poverty alleviation strategies 
In recent years, the study of LULCC has become an important topic of research 
LULCC processes are triggered by the interaction of anthropogenic and biophysical drivers 
The upper part of the Blue Nile Basin is characterized by a very rich diversity of natural resources, including land, vegetation, genetic diversity, and water in a diverse biophysical and socioeconomic environment experiencing multi-faceted pressures 
Relatively abundant water resources in Ethiopia have played a minimal role in the development of the national economy. As a result, the country intends to place a priority on water resource development as an essential strategy for economic and social development 
The Finchaa catchment has a large share of Ethiopia's hydroelectric power, sugar, and ethanol supply. However, there has been limited multidisciplinary and independent research in the catchment compared to other areas. There are few studies on Finchaa catchment in LULCC 
The goal of this study is to investigate problems of scale and temporal variability of the LULCC in the Finchaa catchment. Specifically, the objectives of this study are (i) analyze the changes in land use/land cover over the last 30 years (1987-2017), (ii) examine the LULC inter-category transitions and the LULCC associations with slope, (iii) identify the major driving factors and explore the implications of the LULCC in Finchaa catchment. | Materials and Methods:  | Study Area: The study was conducted in the upper Blue Nile Basin, Finchaa sub-basin in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Finchaa sub-basin lies in 9¬∞10' to 10¬∞00' North latitude and 37¬∞00' and 37¬∞40' East longitude, covering a 3781 km 2 area. The catchment is characterized by high topographic relief, with elevation ranging from 851 to 3213 meters above sea level. The area has large upstream water potential sites, intensive irrigable downstream lands, and high hydropower potential 
The annual rainfall of Finchaa catchment ranges from 1367 to 1842 mm, with the lower rainfall occurring in the northern lowlands and the higher rainfall greater than 1500 mm occurring in the southern and western highlands of the sub-basin. June to September is the main rainy season of the catchment, with an average annual rainfall of 1604 mm and a peak occurring between July to August  | Data Sources and Methodology:  | Spatial Data: Landsat images, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and field data were used in this study. A 30 m DEM obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) at https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/ was used to delineate the watershed and generate slope maps of the study area. Ground Control Points (GCP) for image classification and accuracy assessment were collected through direct field observations using Global positioning system (GPS), Landsat composites, and Google Earth. Two sets of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery and one set of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI-TIRs) image obtained from USGS at https://landsatlook.usgs.gov/ were used for the analysis of LULCC (Table  | Socio-Economic Data: We used a socio-economic survey to collect information to improve the understanding of local resources, resources use, interactions with the government decision-making process, and community perceptions of trends and priority issues 
During both KIIs and FGDs, open-ended questions were used concerning the major shifts in LULC, the relationship among the biophysical environment, institution, socio-economic activities and demography. Discussions on practices and regulations that influence land management in their locality were held to get information on the management perspectives, evaluate the efforts made towards resource management and their challenges. The issue related to land degradation and the most priority issues that require interventions were also discussed. During the discussion and interviews, the main focuses were to get sufficient information about the past and present trend of LULCC, identify the root driving factors of the changes and implications of LULCC on the socioeconomic activity of the community and the environment. To better understand the major observed problems of the catchment and resource management practice, transect walks, field walks, and informal talks with people in their farms/fields were used. Farmers were asked to explain what parts of the landscape were changed and explained why the change had occurred. The farmers were also asked to describe the consequences of the changes in their livelihood, surroundings, and environment. Furthermore, farmers were asked to explain how their socio-economic activity contributes to the land-use change.
Field observation was carried out based on checklists designed in advance to observe the situation in the watershed, and photographs of important sites were taken to enrich the study. With the aid of field observation, information from experts, and review of documents from national and regional offices, eight classes of land use/land cover types were identified as depicted in Table  | LULC Classes Description:  | Agricultural land: Areas used for crop cultivation (both annual and perennial), fallow plots, scattered rural settlements, some pastures and plantations around settlements. Sparsely located settlements and roads constructed from earthwork were included here as it was difficult to separate them from agricultural lands. Rangeland (Shrubland) Sparsely located trees with brush and shrub form types, bushes, woodlands, grasses, mixed rangelands, and transitional forests (less dense forests) were included. | Forest land: Areas covered with a dense growth of trees that include: evergreen forests, mixed forest land, deciduous forest lands. Plantations of indigenous specious of trees were also considered here. | Urban and built-up: Residential, commercial and services, recreational sites, public installation, infrastructures. Due to their similar reflectance, bare lands and rock query sites were considered here. Roads made from pavement are also included in this category. | Water bodies: Areas that are completely inundated by water like lakes and major rivers. | Grazing land: Area covered with small grasses, scattered bushes and trees, and wetland (intermittent) used for grazing. | Swampy land: Areas that are swampy during both wet and dry seasons Commercial farm Areas used for sugarcane plantations and sesame cultivations. | Data Analysis: The analysis and quantification of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the LULC from 1987 to 2017 were achieved through Landsat image processing, classification, and post-processing. Image preprocessing involved geometric and radiometric correction before the image analysis. In this study, only six spectral bands of TM (band 1-5 and 7) and eight spectral bands of Landsat 8 OLI (bands 1-7 and 9) were used during the image processing for LULC classification. A 15-m spatial resolution layer (band 8) found in OLI was fused with 30 m multispectral bands using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method found in ERDAS. The pan-sharpened OLI image was used only to get a better visualization and interpretation of the images.
The maximum likelihood parametric rule was used to classify each pixel based on the known ground truth. A minimum of 50 samples is recommended for image classification with maps having less than 12 classes  | Accuracy Assessment: The process of doing an accuracy assessment involved generating a set of points from the classified image and comparing the positions of points whose location was determined by the ground truth data and corresponding coordinates from the original maps 
From the error matrix, overall accuracy, user's accuracy, producer's accuracy, and kappa statistics were derived. Kappa coefficients typically lie between 0 and 1. According to Viera and Garrett  | Land Use/Land Cover Change Analysis: Once the land cover classifications were derived, Arc Geographic and Information System (ArcGIS 10.1) was used to prepare the LULC maps of 1987, 2002, and 2017. Then, the areas of the LULC classes were calculated from the maps, and analysis of LULCC and rates of changes were computed. Total LULCC between the two periods is calculated as follows:
Total LULC Gain/loss = Area of the final year -Area of the initial year
Percentage of LULC Gain/loss = (Area of the final year -Area of the initial year) Total area of the catchment
A LULC matrix was developed by ArcGIS to analyze the LULC inter-category transitions and examined the catchment experience in LULC transitions. The matrix was developed for the 1987-2002 and 2002-2017 transitions. Through the matrix, the area of gains, losses, persistence, and swapping between the LULC types are calculated.
The terrain slope-LULC relationship was developed by overlaying the slope generated from the DEM of the study area and the classified maps. Then, the distribution of LULCC with slope was quantified. The result was helpful to see how continuous demand for agricultural land had brought changes in LULC of higher slope areas.
The socio-economic data from the KIIs and FGDs were analyzed thematically with the focus on the past and current conditions of LULC, drivers, and implications of the LULCC. The ranking was used to identify the most common drivers and consequences of the changes. | Result and Discussion:  | Accuracy Assessment: The confusion error matrix and Kappa statistics used for the classification accuracy of 1987, 2002, and 2017 LULC maps are presented in Table  | Spatio-Temporal Distributions of Land Use/Land Cover Changes in Finchaa Catchment: Agricultural lands, the dominant land use type of the catchment, covered 36.27% of the study area in 1987, 42.64% in 2002, and 51.86% in 2017 (Table 
In 1987, forestland, rangeland, and grazing land were the major LULC accounting for 21.55%, 20.63%, and 13.55% of the catchment, respectively. Similarly, forestland, rangeland, and grazing land were the major LULC in 2002 and 2017. For the periods of 1987 to 2002 and 2002 to 2017, forestland and rangeland showed the highest decline, whereas agricultural land showed the highest increase. Comparatively, the LULCC was higher for the changes from 2002 to 2017 than the changes from 1987 to 2002. The distribution of LULCC over 30 years is given by Figure  | LULC Inter-Category Transitions and Changes Trajectories in Finchaa Watershed: The LULCC analysis of Finchaa showed that the catchment experienced intricate LULC transitions. LULC matrix was developed for the 1987-2002 and 2002-2017 transitions. Through the matrix, the areas gained, lost, persisted, and swapped among the LULC types were calculated (Table 
During 1987-2002, the highest losses occurred in rangeland class, followed by forest land and grazing land. Urban and built-up areas followed by water bodies and swampy areas showed the lowest loss. Similar patterns of changes were observed during the 2002-2017 period with the highest losses shown by rangeland, followed by forest land and agricultural land, whereas the lowest loss was shown by urban and built-up followed by swampy area and water bodies. The highest gain for the period of 1987-2002 was shown by agricultural land followed by rangeland and forest land, whereas the lowest gain was shown by urban and built up followed by water bodies. For period's 2002-2017, agricultural land followed by rangeland and grazing land has shown the highest gain while water bodies followed by swampy and urban and built-up area shows the lowest gain.
Concerning net persistence, the ratio of the net change (gain-loss) to diagonals of each class, urban and built-up area has shown the highest net change to persistence ratio during 1987-2002 and 2002-2017. The highest net change to persistence ratio implies the lowest persisting class of the LULC. The lowest persisting LULC class in the Finchaa catchment was urban and built-up followed by rangeland during 1987-2002, whereas agricultural land followed by grazing land has shown the highest persisting LULC class. During 2002-2017, urban and built-up, and commercial farm were the lowest persisting LULC, and water bodies followed by agricultural lands were the highest persisting LULC classes.  | Land Use/Land Cover Change with Slope Gradients in Finchaa Catchment: The continuous demand for agricultural land brought changes in LULC, especially in higher slope areas. A large part of the land (22.7%) was found in moderately rolling (8% to 15%), followed by the strongly rolling slope (15% to 30%) with the dominant agricultural land. In 1987, forest lands were higher in undulating slope (2% to 5%), followed by the gently rolling slope (5% to 8%). However, in 2017 forest land was higher in the hilly slope (30% to 60%), followed by a strongly rolling slope. The shift by forest land dominance from the undulating and gently rolling to the hilly and strongly rolling was owing to the agricultural land expansion, urban and built up, and increased water body on the lower slopes. Over the three decades (1987 to 2017), agricultural land expanded with the maximum rate of expansion shown on slope classes of strongly rolling to very hilly. The forestland was decreased in all slope ranges with the maximum rate of loss in gently undulating to moderately rolling slopes. Likewise, the swamp area was decreased in all slope ranges.
From 1987 to 2017, the urban and built-up area expanded in all slope ranges with the highest expansion on the moderately rolling to gently rolling slopes. Grazing land was increased only on the slope ranges of 2%-5% and 0%-2% (gently undulating). The water bodies increased on all slope ranges except with higher slope areas. The highest increase by water bodies was shown on slope ranges from 0% to 2%. In contrast to water bodies, rangeland decreased on all slope ranges except in very hilly slope areas. The highest decline was shown in the slope ranges from 8% to 15%.
The spatial distribution of LULCC with terrain slope in 1987 and 2017 is given in Table  | Drivers and Impacts of Land Use/Land Cover change: The results of FGDs, KIIs, and field observation revealed that both anthropogenic and natural processes derived LULCC. However, anthropogenic activities were found to be predominant and immediate as compared to the natural process as a driver of LULCC. Further, some drivers are not only limited to local specific issues; rather, they are regional, national, and global issues. From a range of different drivers, respondents perceived six human-related activities as major drivers of LULCC in the study area (Table 
KIIs and FGDs showed that the focus of the government to build hydropower projects and irrigation projects were among the major socio-economic and institutional causes of LULCC. The expansion of irrigation projects increased commercial farms, and the construction of reservoirs increased water bodies in the catchment. Infrastructure and built-up are also increasing in the catchment. For example, the construction of institutes like the Teacher Training College, Technical and Vocational Education and Training, private colleges, the Wollega University Shambu campus, a sugar factory, the Horro Cattle breed production center, and the Shambu referral hospital contributed to urban and built-up area expansion.
The expansion of hydropower projects has displaced the community from their farmland and forced them to resettle in other places without adequate compensation. The increased resettlement on unproductive lands coupled with the relative depreciation of agricultural land made it difficult for inhabitants to remain, forcing them to move. Further, the lack of jobs for youths and urban developments in the catchment amplified the socio-economic activities for LULCC. Group discussions with the community and interviews with agricultural experts on how the construction of projects and weak environmental consideration caused LULCC were added as follows:
""The construction of Fincha Dam 1973, Amerti Reservoir in 1987, and Neshe Dam in 2012 displaced many households from their farmland and made the community landless. Then, those who have good wealth moved to the town and settled. The poor were forced to work for others who have owned land in other places. Others are also moved to the town to work daily labor activities."" (Community Members, Abay Chomen District and Horro District, Focus Group Discussion, March 2018).
""The displacements of the community from reservoir areas have made land scarcity, especially in highland parts of the catchment. Consequently, there were efforts to drain wetlands mainly for agricultural land expansion, which was described in the local language as 'Duula Caffee Qoorsuu' to mean campaign of wetland draining. On the other hand, wetlands are not equally valued as natural resources. For example, there is no one accused of wetland degradation. The use of wetlands for agriculture limited the area of communal grazing where many livestock populations were allowed for grazing."" (Agricultural Officer, Guduru District, Key Informant Interview, April 2018).
The expansion of agriculture on communal and private grazing lands reduced the area of grazing lands. Consequently, a small area of land is used frequently for grazing a livestock population beyond its capacity. The experience of the community in using controlled grazing is low.
According to KIIs and FGDs, the community perceived six major consequences of LULCC in Finchaa catchment. These include the decline of agricultural yield, biodiversity, and habitat loss, low and decreasing profitability of farmers, land and soil degradation, water resource decline, and extended aridity and drought.
Losses of soil fertility have caused the decline of agricultural yields. The following quotes show how crop yield and soil fertility is related to the profitability of the farmers:
""Agricultural yields are declined from time to time. Farmer's profitability from agriculture is decreasing. In some areas, the application of fertilizer is not adequate to recover crop yields due to the high decline in soil fertility. Soil acidity is increasing in the region and lack of adequate resources to treat soil acidity have worsened the situation."" (Agricultural Officer and Development Agent, Jima Geneti District, Key Informant Interview, May 2018).
""In the past, we used to produce adequate yields. But now, we are losing some parts of our farms as the land is becoming less fertile, and we are not getting adequate yields. Even, the benefits from the crop yields are not enough to cover the cost of the fertilizer. We are struggling just to get a hand to mouth production, and we are unable to support our children for a better life.""(Farmer group, Jima Geneti District, Focus group Discussion, May 2018).
The beginning and expansion of the commercial farms initiated the community to start new cultivation in the lowland areas. A 67-year-old man described the past and present situation in the catchment as follows:
""I was born and grew up in Gudane village. When I was young, forestland, woodlands, and grasslands covered a significant portion of the area, and there were a variety of animals. I used to hunt animals like buffalo and bushbuck with my friends. But now, the forests are cleared, and it is difficult to find animals like buffalo in the area."" (Abay Chomen District, March 2018).
The interview with the natural resource management expert on forest degradation was ""The community used to destroy forests to have new farmland, to build settlements, for charcoal and domestic fuel, timber and woodworks. Further, farmers expand agricultural lands to natural forests. After cutting the natural forests, the farmers plant exotic trees such as eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus), which were mechanisms to own the land. Consequently, forest covers are reduced to remnants and are remained around high pick mountain areas, inaccessible areas, and along streams and valleys areas.""(Natural Resource Management officers, Abay Chomen District and Horro District, Key Informant Interview, March 2018).
Currently, landslides have become the common form of land degradation in Jima Geneti (upstream of Fincha Reservoir). They are the main sources of sediment/siltation for the reservoir. An expert interview regarding landslides and their challenge was quoted as follows:
""Landslide was found to be the major problems that destroyed the farmlands, roads, and sometimes houses. The community sometimes perceives landslide as a natural process. However, the areas affected by landslides are areas that have been covered with forest once, but the forest is cleared now and areas that receive high erosion from the hillside. Erosion from the roadside, where there is no proper outlet, also caused gully and landslides. The efforts to manage landslide was limited by resources and skill required as landslide is becoming frequent."" (Natural Resources Management Officer and Environment and Climate Change Officer, Jima Geneti District, Key Informant Interviews, May 2018).
The other implication of LULCC revealed in the catchment was the decline of water resources. The discharges from the agricultural field and pollution from urban and domestic wastes are specified as the causes of water resource pollution in the catchment. The interview with the natural resource management expert regarding the status of the reservoir areas and streams described the issue as ""There is no established buffer zone for the reservoir areas, and there are no stream protections. The farmers cultivate until the edge of the stream and the streams are exposed to siltation and scouring by soil erosion. Braided rivers are formed when erosion deposits soil and the river depth gets decreased and begin to form new channels and even change the flow course."" (Natural Resources Management officer, Horro District and Abay Chomen District, Key Informant Interview, March 2018).
""In several areas within the catchment, groundwater is an important source of water supply. In areas where wetlands are drained, the springs are dried out, the levels of hand-dug wells are declined."" (Zonal Water Resources Officer, Horro Guduru Wollega Zone, Key Informant Interview, March 2018)
The field observation result was consistent with the interview. When the level of water in the reservoir area declines, free land will be formed. Then, farmers will use the free land for winter cultivation (locally named ""Bone"") and when the reservoir fills, it will submerge the farm areas and take all the minerals and soil into the reservoir. Figure  | Discussion:  | Land Use/Land Cover Changes: The LULCC analysis of Finchaa catchment over 30 years (1987-2017) revealed a dramatic LULCC (Table 
Although deforestation occurred throughout the catchment, the high decline of forest cover was because of the expansion of the commercial farms, land expansion, and continuous wood extraction. Before 1987, lowland areas of the catchment (also called Finchaa valley) were covered with forests, woodlands, and rangeland. In the Finchaa catchment, not only the coverage but also the qualities of the forest compositions (especially indigenous plants) were diminished. Studies conducted in different parts of the upper Blue Nile of Ethiopia also reported similar findings. For example, Wubie et al. 
Urban and built-up areas are continuously increasing, with the highest rate in recent years. The increments are due to the expansion and construction of infrastructures like roads, institutions, and settlements. The same trend was witnessed in the Blue Nile basin, the Gelda catchment 
The findings of forest decline and urban growth were also reported with different studies over Africa. For example, manmade impervious surfaces and built-up have increased at the expense of biomass over the whole of Africa between 2000 and 2015  | Drivers of LULC Dynamics and Their Consequences: Although both natural and anthropogenic drivers of LULCC were stated in the catchment, anthropogenic drivers were marked as the most immediate drivers. The community also enhances the natural process by deforestation and unsustainable agricultural practices, which worsen the effects of the LULCC. Restoring such land degradation and the effect of these processes could take time and require a huge amount of resources. A study conducted in southeastern Ethiopia reported that anthropogenic factors were the major responsible drivers of LULCC 
The construction of the reservoir had displaced farmers and caused land scarcity. The scarcity of land, coupled with the need to farm more land, has led the community to cultivate steep slopes. As presented under the analysis of LULCC with slope (Table 
Urban development, scarcity of grazing mismanagement, and lack of adequate technology to improve agricultural practices and livestock also contributed to LULCC. A similar study conducted in Munessa-Shashemene reported similar findings that the social, economic, and environmental policies and technology highly contributed to LULCC 
The adverse impacts of LULCC were associated with the underlying factors related to human activities. The scarcity of land and the need to farm more coupled with resettlement have reduced grazing lands. The reduction of the grazing land forced the community to reduce their livestock, which has negative effects on household income and their consumption of livestock products. Likewise, population growth and agricultural expansion were associated with biophysical degradations like soil, water, and environment. Equally important to the environmental problem, socio-economic and institutional problems were also posed a significant impact on the sustainability of the sub-basin. For example, increased agricultural land on a steep slope without proper management practices potentially have increased the vulnerability of the land to erosion and sedimentation in water bodies of the catchment. A similar study also reported that LULCC has a significant potential for reducing the production of subsistence agriculture production 
The process of the hydro-development process affected local communities and their livelihoods, mostly by changing access to land and also less water 
According to KIIs and FGDs, extended aridity and drought (longer dry season) are increasing in the catchment. The increase in the longer dry season has amplified the effects of water security in the catchment. A climate projection study reported that the upper Blue Nile basin will face regional water scarcity regardless of the increase or decrease in precipitation  | Conclusions: The quantitative spatio-temporal evidence obtained through interpretations of satellite images shows that Finchaa has undergone significant LULCC since 1987. Between 1987 and 2017, agricultural land, commercial farm, urban and built-up areas increased while rangeland, grazing lands, and swampy area decreased. The transition matrix developed to assess inter-category transitions and the change trajectories highlight the dominant dynamic events and internal conversions between LULC classes. The urban and built-up areas show the highest ratio of the net change to persistence, whereas agricultural land has shown the lowest net change to persistence ratio in the 1987-2002 transition. In general, the highest net change to persistence ratio is associated with the lowest persisting LULC classes. The spatial distribution of LULCC with slope shows a continuous expansion of agriculture and settlement and a reduction of forestland and swampy along all slopes. The rangeland has been decreased in all slope ranges except hilly slope areas.
Agricultural expansion, urbanization and infrastructure developments, timber and woodworks, resettlement, uncontrolled grazing, and weak environmental considerations were identified as the major driving factors of LULCC. The adverse impacts of LULCC are associated with the underlying causes of human activities related to the environment, socio-economic, biophysical, and institutional problems. The decline of agricultural yield, biodiversity and habitat loss, low and decreasing profitability of farmers, land and soil degradation, water resource decline, and extended aridity and drought are the major impacts of LULCC perceived by the community. Notably, increased cultivation of lands situated either on steep slopes or in flood-prone areas requires urgent action to avert the challenges of land and soil degradation as it is threatening the survival of forest remnants and other important natural resources. Further, the lifespan of the three reservoirs in the catchment depends on the sustainability of natural resources management.
The qualitative and quantitative study of the LULCC, its driving forces, and the impacts presented in this study could help a decision-maker by providing information that supports integrated watershed management and future developments. Special attention should be given to rehabilitate the degraded lands and to protect the natural resource in the catchment. With this, the undesirable effects of complex environmental dynamics in the catchment can be reduced.","The diagonals (written in bold) indicates area of land that remained unchanged for each class during the transition.

Keywords Text mining ‚ãÖ Information extraction ‚ãÖ Topic identification Scientific databases ‚ãÖ Mobile learning ‚ãÖ Higher education | Introduction: Nowadays, almost all of the existing information in different institutions (e.g. government, business, industry, and others) is preserved in electronic documents in which it contains semi-structured data. In these documents, the ""abstract"" is an example of unstructured text component. Whereas, examples of structured fields in a document are: author's name, publication date, title, and category 
Text mining intends to detect the information that was not recognized before through extracting it automatically from various text-based sources. Structured data can be handled through data mining tools while unstructured or semi-structured datasets like full-text documents, emails, and HTML files can be handled through text mining. Typically, the information will be kept in a natural form known as text. Text mining is not similar to web mining. When something is explored on the web by the user, it means that it is previously known and it was written by someone else 
Data is the basic kind of information, which is required to be organized and mined for the knowledge generation. Discovering patterns and trends from huge data is a significant challenge. Finding out the unknown trends and patterns from databases properly is a major objective of data mining. It is a method where data pre-processing is necessary before applying any other method. Many approaches like clustering, classification, and decision trees are involved in data mining. All the textual based information is stored by electronic means, either on a client's personal computers or on a web server. Due to the increasing growth in hardware storage devices, any computer or laptop has the ability to store an enormous amount of data. Creating new information can be simple while finding out relevant information from a huge amount of data is challenging. In order to extract the relevant information, knowledge, or patterns from various sources that are in unstructured form, text mining technique can be employed. The common structure of text mining involves two consecutive stages: text refining and knowledge distillation. In text refining, free-form text documents are converted into an intermediate form, whereas in knowledge distillation, patterns or knowledge are derived from intermediate form. Intermediate form (IF) can be either semi-structured like the theoretical graph illustration or structured like the relational data illustration. IF can be either a document-based where every entity symbolizes document, it can be a concept-based where every unit symbolizes an object or a concept of interest in a particular area.
Various research areas, techniques, and models are involved in different research domains. The hottest topics of the research domains are the primary focus of many research papers. The research results of a particular domain may influence other research domains since some research domains may have similar topics. These research topics always discuss such a promising research area that is worth studying. Therefore, the trend of cross domain is determined in this research. The longitudinal trends of academic articles in Mobile Leaning (ML) were explored in this research with the help of text mining methods. We recovered and examined (300) refereed journal articles and conference proceedings from various authentic databases.
The primary goals of this research are (1) Using text mining techniques for identifying the topics of a scientific text related to ML research and developing a hierarchical and evolutionary connection among these topics. (2) Using visualization tools for presenting both the topics and the association among them as a convenient way to help users to determine relevant topics.
This paper is categorized as follows: Sect. 2 provides an inclusive background concerning in the text mining field. Other related studies are addressed by Sect. 3. Research methodology is presented in Sect. 4. The results are demonstrated in Sect. 5. Conclusion and future perspectives are presented in Sect. 6. | Background on Text Mining and Information Extraction:  | Text Mining: The development in the fields of web, digital libraries, technical documentation, medical data has made it easier to access a larger amount of a textual documents, which come together to develop useful data resources  | Information Extraction: An initiation point for computers to evaluate unstructured manuscripts is to use Information Extraction (IE). IE software recognizes key phrases and relationships included in the manuscript. This is performed through finding the predefined arrangements in a text; this technique is called pattern matching. Regular language text documents consist of information that cannot be utilized for mining. IE agrees with the documentation, choosing appropriate articles, and the association among them to make them more available for added guidance  | Extracting Knowledge from Text: Under most of the conditions, only specific data is obtained from the information extracted from unstructured text instead of abstract knowledge. In such a case, it is required to employ a text mining task along with additional techniques to mine knowledge from the data in hand  | Text Mining Methods and Techniques: Text mining is usually employed to obtain quick results  | Text Clustering: Text clustering is based on the Cluster hypothesis which proposes that relevant documents must have more similarities with one another than the non-relevant ones 
Various methods and algorithms based on unsupervised document management are included in the process of document clustering. In the clustering process, the numbers, properties, and associations of the grouped sets are initially unknown. The grouping of documents is performed by categorizing them into a particular category such as medical, financial, and/or legal  | Association Rule Extraction: A study by 
The ARM identifies the variable-value combinations which tend to occur frequently. The method of ARM in data mining also known as knowledge discovery in databases; that is similar to the correlation analysis that finds out the relationships between two variables. Wong et al.  | K-Means Algorithms: The k-mean approach divides the data set into k clusters, where every cluster is subjected to be represented by the mean of points; called the centroid. A two-step repetitive process is employed for the application of the algorithm: (1) Assigning every point to the nearest centroid. (2) Evaluating the centroids for a recently developed group. The process is ended when the cluster centroid comes to a constant value. The k-mean algorithm has an extensive application owing to its direct parallelization. Furthermore, the order of respective data does not affect the kmean algorithm which attributes the numerical characteristics to it. It is required to mention the maximum value of k at the beginning of the process. The representation of the cluster is made by the k-medoid algorithm that chooses the object adjoining the center of the cluster. Though, the selection of the k objects is done randomly in the algorithm. The selected objects help to determine the distance. A cluster is formed on the basis of the nearest object to k, whereas the other objects acquire the position of k recursively till the required quality of the cluster is achieved  | Information Visualization: Information visualization puts great textual bases in a visual hierarchy or plan and offers browsing abilities as well as general searching. This technique offers improved and quicker comprehensive knowledge, which assists us to mine enormous accumulation documents. The operators can distinguish the colors, associations, and gaps. The assortment of documents can be demonstrated as a structured layout utilizing indexing or vector space model. | Word Cloud: Jayashankar and Sridaran 
Word cloud tends to serve as a preliminary stage for in-depth analysis of certain text material  | Related Work: Many research works contributed to the field of IE through the use of various techniques. The primary focus of these researches was to determine how different text mining procedures can be utilized as the structured data sets exist in the text document format. This part begins with defining the topic of the research, evaluating previous researches, and then major techniques are applied using information extraction and text mining. In order to determine the topic of each research area and to develop an evolutionary and hierarchical connection between these topics, 
Moreover, these tools are used in order to show the connection between these topics and to offer interactive functions so that users can effectively find the cross-domain topics and know the trends of cross-domain research. Moloshnikov et al.

We can observe from the surveyed literature that there is a limitation in addressing the issue of IE from research articles using data mining techniques. The synergy between these approaches (i.e. IE with data mining techniques) helps to discover different interesting text patterns in the retrieved articles. This approach could be applied to a variety of research topics, where in each topic can generate a wide range of knowledge patterns. Mobile learning (M-learning) has become one of the trendy fields in the higher education  | Research Methodology:  | Text Mining Processing Framework: We have developed our customized framework which is inspired by the designed framework proposed by  | Data Collection and Pre-processing: The research articles were collected from six scientific databases, namely: Springer, Wiley, Science Direct, SAGE, IEEE, and Cambridge. The search term used for data collection is simply ""Mobile Learning in higher education"". Based on that, 300 research articles in the field of mobile learning were collected. These articles are categorized into six folders, where each folder represents the database where these articles were retrieved.
The presence of the linguistic noise is a common problem in the content of the extracted articles and we have dealt with. Then, the cleaned data are uploaded into RapidMiner tool while the misplaced and unnecessary data have been removed from the dataset. In order to improve the performance and data quality, all the irrelevant characteristics are debarred while the data is being uploaded into RapidMiner tool. The major steps involve the separation of the document into tokens; this task is called Tokenization  | Experimental Results: The application of various text mining techniques on the collected articles presents different results and suggestions. In the present study, we are trying to apply almost all of the text mining techniques that were mentioned in the literature on the collected articles. Nevertheless, these techniques have not been applied to the research articles concerning mobile learning in higher education; the reason that makes this study is unique and adds a value to the research community. | Q1: What are the most frequent keywords in the collected articles?: As per the study of  | Fig. 2 Words cloud across all databases: Moreover, we have applied the word frequency technique on the text in the collected articles.

According to the surveyed literature, there is a limitation in discussing the issue of information extraction from research articles using data mining techniques. The synergy between information extraction and data mining techniques helps to discover different interesting text patterns in the retrieved articles. This approach could be applied to a variety of research topics, where in each topic it can generate a wide range of knowledge patterns. Mobile learning has become one of the trendy fields in the higher education. Accordingly, we can perceive that information extraction and data mining techniques were never applied to the mobile learning field. This creates a need for collecting a dataset that consists of several research articles in the field of mobile learning from different scientific databases, and applying the proposed approach on them.
Three hundred refereed journal articles from six scientific databases were collected, and textually analyzed through text mining techniques. The six databases are Science Direct, IEEE, Wiley, Cambridge, SAGE, and Springer. The selection of the collected articles was based on the criteria that all these articles should incorporate mobile learning as the main component in the higher educational context. In the present study, text clustering, association rule, word cloud, and word frequency are the main tasks used for text analysis.
By applying the word cloud and the word frequency techniques, results indicated that ""Learning"" is the most frequent keyword across all the collected articles; followed by ""Patients"" and ""Students"", respectively. The increasing number of the words: ""learning"" and ""students"" could be attributed to the fact that learning and students form the core of the higher educational processes. In addition, results revealed that the words: ""patients"", ""care"", ""medical"", and ""clinical"", were frequently mentioned in Springer database. These results indicate that the most frequent linked words are those focused on studies targeting mobile learning in medical education. Springer database represents the richest source that contains these words followed by Wiley and Science Direct, respectively. That is, researchers who are specialized in mobile medical education should benefit from these results as it shows them that Springer database is the topmost among other databases for finding research articles in this field.
By applying the association rule technique, findings showed that the term ""Education"" is shown as being central to the tree structure having all the relevant words connected to it. This could be referred to the fact that the text acquired from the collected research articles is mainly concentrated on the learning field. In addition, we performed the similarity measure on the collected articles in order to identify the topics that are highly similar to each other. Results revealed that the similarity operator could not detect a clear similarity among some topics the reason is that these topics are interrelated and similar in meaning to each other (i.e. all the articles are discussing the topic of mobile learning in higher education).
By applying the clustering technique, we used the k-means algorithm through the use of different k values. Results indicated that there were six clusters. Almost all of the articles (N = 285) were accumulated in one cluster; this indicates that these articles are discussing the main studied topic (i.e. mobile learning in higher education). On the other side, by further investigating the remaining articles (N = 15) that are accumulated in the other clusters; it has been found that these articles are discussing other topics in learning and education rather than the studied topic. By distributing the collected research papers across their years of publication, findings showed that there was a booming increase in the number of published articles during the years 2015 through 2016. This could be referred to the reason that mobile learning has witnessed in these years an enormous attraction from a lot of scholars who published many articles that contribute to the evolvement of mobile learning.
As a future work, we are interested in collecting articles from various research topics, i.e. not to focus on one area. This will help us to find more interesting patterns in these articles and how such articles are distributed among the targeted databases. In addition, this will allow the similarity operator to work properly and to draw a clear relationship among the articles.","Text mining methods and techniques (, , , 2014) || A Survey of text mining in social media: facebook and twitter perspectives (, , , , 2017) || Data warehousing and data mining (, , 2000) || A survey of text mining techniques and applications (, , 2009) || Automating content extraction of html documents (, , , , , 2005) || A review of data mining applications in crime (, , , , 2016) || Knowledge discovery in textual databases (KDT) (, , 1995) || Text mining: The state of the art and the challenges (, 1999) || Untangling text data mining (, 1999) || Text mining: natural language techniques and text mining applications (, , 1998) || A text mining technique using association rules extraction (, , , , 2008) || Text mining: challenges and future directions (, 2015) || Techniques on text mining (, , 2012) || A Survey of lexical functional grammar in the Arabic context (, , , 2016) || A survey of intelligent language tutoring systems (, , 2014) || Parsing modern standard Arabic using Treebank resources (, , , 2015) || Information extraction: Towards scalable, adaptable systems (, 2003) || Information extraction (, , 1996) || Knowledge representation and information extraction for analysing architectural patterns (, , , , , 2016) || Template-based information mining from HTML documents (, , 1997) || Text mining with information extraction, multilingualism and electronic language management (, , 2003) || TopCat: data mining for topic identification in a text corpus (, , , 2004) || Mining knowledge from text repositories using information extraction: A review (, , , 2014) || Technology Mining bibliometrics analysis: applying network analysis and cluster analysis (, 2015) || Similarity measures for text document clustering (, 2008) || TopCat: Data mining for topic identification in a text corpus (, , ) ||  (, 1999) || Clustering based on association rule hypergraphs (, , , , 1997) || A survey on text mining in social networks (, , , , , , , 2015) || An introduction to association rule mining: An application in counseling and help-seeking behavior of adolescents (, , 2007) || Visualizing association rules for text mining (, , , 1999. 1999) || Superlative model using word cloud for short answers evaluation in eLearning (, , 2016) || Get your head into the clouds: using word clouds for analyzing qualitative assessment data (, , 2014) || The folksonomy tag cloud: when is it useful?

The potential land requirements and related land use change emissions of solar energy,Dirk-Jan Van De Ven; I√±igo Capellan-Per√©z; I√±aki Arto; Ignacio Cazcarro; Carlos De Castro; Pralit Patel; Mikel Gonzalez-Eguino,"Although the transition to renewable energies will intensify the global competition for land, the potential impacts driven by solar energy remain unexplored. In this work, the potential solar land requirements and related land use change emissions are computed for the EU, India, Japan and South Korea. A novel method is developed within an integrated assessment model which links socioeconomic, energy, land and climate systems. At 25-80% penetration in the electricity mix of those regions by 2050, we find that solar energy may occupy 0.5-5% of total land. The resulting land cover changes, including indirect effects, will likely cause a net release of carbon ranging from 0 to 50 gCO 2 /kWh, depending on the region, scale of expansion, solar technology efficiency and land management practices in solar parks. Hence, a coordinated planning and regulation of new solar energy infrastructures should be enforced to avoid a significant increase in their life cycle emissions through terrestrial carbon losses.
The technologies harnessing renewable energy sources are characterized by a power density several orders of magnitude lower than fossil fuels 1 . As a consequence, the transition to these sources of energy is expected to intensify the global competition for land 
For sources of renewable energy other than bioenergy, land requirements and the associated environmental impacts remain understudied in the literature from a quantitative point of view 1,10 . In the case of solar energy, the land competition element is usually expected to be negligible due to its higher relative energy density compared to bioenergy and the possibility to integrate it in urban areas or non-productive land 7,14-16 , and as such is currently excluded from official statistical reporting and integrated assessment models (IAMs). However, recent studies based on satellite views of utility-scale solar energy (USSE) under operation, either in the form of photovoltaics (PV) or concentrated solar power (CSP), show that their land use efficiency (LUE) is up to six times lower than initial estimates 
The installation of USSE on land is subject to a diversity of constraints: solar resource constraints, which are related to the solar irradiance in a certain area; geographical constraints such as the slope and the existing use of the land; and regulatory constraints, e.g. the protected status of the land, often related to ecosystem and wildlife preservation ","Solar land occupation.: Table 
The future land requirements of solar energy obtained for each scenario and region can be put in perspective compared, for example, to the current level of built-up area and agricultural cropland. In the three regions, a large part of the total built-up area (urban and solar land) will consist of solar PV panels or CSP heliostats by 2050 if at least half of the produced electricity comes from solar power. Land for solar would amount to over 50% of the current EU urban land, over 85% for India, and over 75% in Japan and South-Korea. From a different perspective, a significant part of the sunlight captured for commercial use would be used for electricity generation instead of growing crops, especially in Japan and South-Korea (29-39%) and the EU (8-10%). The relative projected land area dedicated to either crops or solar energy strongly differs within each region, with potential local ecosystem and landscape implications (see Figure 
Land cover changes. Solar energy infrastructure currently occupies a negligible amount of land globally.
Our results show that this changes in scenarios with a high share of solar energy in the future electricity mix. Figure 
Figure  | Table 1.: Land occupation characteristics at different solar penetration levels by 2050. Ranges show results for with different future solar module efficiencies with left values within each solar-related column representing 28% efficiency and right values 20%. Results for bioenergy scenarios included for comparison. a These are realized penetration levels. See Section 1b in the SM for more information. b Land suitable for commercial purposes does not include the use of rooftop space, deserts or dry scrublands that are not suitable for crop, pasture or forest cultivation. Deserts and dry scrublands in India host about 11.5-12% of solar energy throughout all penetration scenarios of solar energy in India (see Figure  | Solar energy versus bioenergy.: IAMs which link energy, economy, land and climate modules tend to rely strongly on the cultivation of dedicated bioenergy crops (such as switchgrass and miscanthus) in global climate change mitigation scenarios 
Table 
deserts and dry scrublands, as well as bioenergy from waste or agricultural and forestry residue, are assumed not to contribute to LUC emissions nor carbon sequestration. | Discussion: By representing the land requirements of solar energy within an IAM that integrates energy, land, socioeconomic and climate systems, we were able to, for the first time in the literature to our knowledge, estimate the land cover impacts and related LUC emissions of solar energy within climate change mitigation scenarios up to 2050. The obtained results represent a contribution to the novel field of research which analyses the environmental impacts of significantly up scaling renewables other than biomass 
A combination of technical and geopolitical reasons complicates the installation of solar energy far from consumption points. Therefore, a high share of solar generation in the energy mix in relatively densely populated regions with high per capita energy demands can require a significant share of domestic land, comparable to the current built-up area in these regions. The most relevant factors influencing the land use per unit of solar energy are solar irradiation, latitude, and future solar module efficiencies. At the domestic level, solar energy is found to predominantly compete for land with cropland and managed forests, while on a global scale, 27 to 54% of the land required for solar energy is found to indirectly displace unmanaged forests, predominantly outside the Table  | Solar penetration level: Using an existing IAM to study the potential land impacts of solar energy expansion, we were bound to the limitations of this model. One of these was the division of land zones in the model (corresponding to Agro-Ecological zones, see ""Methods"" section), which determine the boundaries of the geographical competition to host solar energy within each region. This pre-defined distribution was originally designed to capture variations in crop yields, and is not ideal for defining the geographical diversity of solar energy ""yields"" within a region. Although a general good correspondence is found, there are also exceptions (see Figure 
To date, land use for solar energy is negligible compared to other human land uses. However, the obtained results show that in future scenarios, with a largely decarbonized electricity system, high penetration rates of solar energy will require significant amounts of land to be occupied by solar power plants. Further work applying ecological tools should be focused towards investigating the implications of these additional land occupation levels -including the additional transmission power lines-in terms of habitat fragmentation and ecosystem disturbance. Siting policies for USSE should avoid adverse land impacts and limit land competition, for example by excluding high yield cropland as already performed in some countries  | Methods: The Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), version 4.3, has been used as a base for this study 
In order to identify the effects that solar energy and bioenergy pathways have on land use and land use change emissions, three pathways have been modelled achieving a defined penetration level in the electricity mix from The land occupation of solar and bioenergy (Figs. 
Land competition in GCAM. Land use and agricultural output in GCAM version 4.3 are calibrated for pre-defined Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZs), which sub-divide geo-political regions in 18 different types of land regions, based on differences in climate zones (tropical, temperate, boreal) and the length of growing periods for crops 
Land use in GCAM has been divided in different nodes that affect the level of competition between different uses (see Figure  | Solar land-use module.: An additional module has been developed for the GCAM model to link the consumption of solar energy with land use, competing with other commercial (crops, timber and intensive pastures) and non-commercial (natural forest, grassland, scrubland) land uses. Specifically, the solarland category is included in the ""Crops"" land node (Figure 
To define the value of land for hosting solar energy, a yield in terms of energy output per unit of land has been defined for every AEZ. Equation (4) defines this yield for each AEZ, which depends on average solar irradiation (I) per AEZ, average efficiency of solar power plants (f 1 ) at the year of installation (t), the averaged performance ratio over the life cycle of the solar power plant (f 2 ) and the land occupation ratio (f 3 ) 1,17 . To estimate I per AEZ, (1) Land occupation i,p,r = land for i i,p,r -land for i NL,p,r 
we overlapped the solar irradiance annual average data 
Figure  | Impact of solar energy infrastructure on local carbon cycle. The impact of USSE infrastructures: on local microclimates is a field in early research stages, although some case studies have been performed. In the case of solar energy on pastures in wet climates, a significant loss of carbon in vegetation and soils can be expected in the land below the infrastructure that is permanently blocked from sunlight, but the year-round carbon cycle in gap areas between rows of solar panels will be hardly affected 
‚Ä¢ Land clearing: Clearing and grubbing of soil and roots, topsoil stripping and stockpiling, land grading and levelling, and soil compaction. Existing vegetation that supports habitat is removed and any other vegetation is often discouraged; weeds and other unwanted vegetation are generally managed with herbicides and by covering the ground with gravel; this is a common practice in various countries 
; Œ≤ and ‚àÖ in radians is based on a rationale of balancing cost minimisation (i.e. no seeding, no herbicides) with land conservation (i.e. minimising ecosystem disturbance). ‚Ä¢ Pasture conversion: Irrespective of the previous land use, all land below and around the infrastructure is (re)seeded with grass before or right after the construction phase, and the land will be managed as pasture, allowing for extensive animal grazing around the solar modules 
The impacts of each of these solarland management regimes on the local carbon cycle depend on the specific location, and the previous land use, and result from off-model calculations applied to the GCAM scenario outcomes which provide land cover changes per year, AEZ, and scenario. Section 2d of the SM gives full details on all applied assumptions and derived carbon cycle impacts.
Use of non-competing space on rooftops and in deserts and dry scrublands. Rooftop space is often used for smaller scale PV systems and has the advantage of not competing for space with other uses and avoiding some of the losses related to electricity transmission and distribution. On the other side, rooftop spaces are often not optimal, and only about 2 to 3% of urbanized surface area can be used for PV systems with reasonable efficiencies (taking into account specific factors such as roof slopes and shadows between buildings) 
Land that is not used and neither has potential for any other productive use from a human perspective, such as deserts and dry scrublands, can be suitable for solar energy. By default, deserts are exempted from land competition in GCAM, while only 10% of current scrublands are included in the land competition module in GCAM v4.3, taking into account both non-fertility of scrublands as well as the protected status of some of these land areas. The EU, Japan and South-Korea have limited amounts of deserts and scrublands (see Table

"Spatio-Temporal Changes of Land-Use/Land Cover Change and the Effects on Ecosystem Service Values in Derong County, China, from 1992-2018",Yanru Wang; Xiaojuan Zhang; Peihao Peng,"Monitoring the spatio-temporal variation of the land-use/land cover change (LULC) and ecosystem service value (ESV) changes will help achieve regional sustainable development and management. Derong County is a part of the Hengduan Mountains area, the most crucial ecological functional area in China, and LULC has changed tremendously in the past 30 years. However, the effects of LULC changes on ecosystem services is not well understood. Based on 1992Based on  , 1995Based on  , 2005Based on  ,  2013Based on  , and 2018   remote sensing images, we used visual interpretation to obtain LULC data and used global value coefficients and modified local value coefficients to assess the spatial-temporal changes of ESV and LULC from 1992 to 2018. The results showed that: (1) From 1992 to 2018, shrubland and grassland decreased, while built-up land, snow, forestland, water body, and cropland area increased. (2) The ESV with an overall decrease of 0.25 √ó 10 8 yuan, ecological projects have played a positive role in improving ESV. In contrast, the main decrease factor of ESV was the increase in agricultural economic development and urban expansion from 1992 to 2018. (3) The ESV spatial distribution indicated the value density of ESV was on the decline, and with the greatest deterioration in Dianyagong. The highest density of ESV area is distributed in Waka, and the lowest density of ESV area is distributed in Bari. This research points out the important role of Derong County in the regional life support system and provides a scientific reference for the sustainable management of dry-hot valley regions' land resources and ecosystem services.","Introduction: Ecosystem services are closely related to human well-being, are essential to human life, and involve all the benefits that humans obtain from natural ecosystems 
Globally, land-use/land cover change (LULC) is an extremely dominant factor affecting the ESV changes 
As a part of the Hengduan Mountains, Derong County is the most representative dry-hot valley region in China 
Based on the research gap identified above and remote sensing data, this study used the revised equivalent factor method, quantitatively evaluated the LULC changes, ESV changes and analyzed the effects of LULC on ESV of Derong County from 1992 to 2018. There are two specific goals:
(1) reveal the temporal and spatial variations of the LULC in Derong County from 1992 to 2018; (2) evaluate the temporal and spatial changes of the ESV in response to LULC. This research is essential for the rational use, protection, and management of land resources in Derong County, promotion of the sustainable development of ecosystem services, and the realization of the coordinated development of economic and ecological protection. These results will provide a scientific reference for scientifically formulating ecological protection measures in the Hengduan Mountains region and dry-hot valley regions of other countries. | Materials and Methods:  | Study Area: Derong County (99 ‚Ä¢ 07 E to 99 ‚Ä¢ 34 E, 28 ‚Ä¢ 09 N to 29 ‚Ä¢ 10 N) located in the southeastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and southwestern part of Sichuan Province, China (Figure  | Remote Sensing Data and Data Processing: The Landsat TM/OLI remote sensing image data were derived from the U.S. Geological Survey (https://www.usgs.gov/).

where V0 and V1 were the area (hm 2 ) of a given type of land-use in the starting and end years of the study period, and T0 and T1 were the starting and end years of the study time, respectively. | ESVs Assessment: Based on the ESV assessment system and historical literature, each land-use type included 11 ecosystem service function types  | LULC Change Dynamics: The single land-use dynamics (M) refers to the annual variability rate of a certain type of land-use area within a concrete time range, which can better analyze land-use changes

where ESV is the value of ecosystem services, i is a land-use type, j is ecosystem service type, A i is the area of the class i land-use type (hm 2 ), VC i is the ESV per unit area of class i land-use type (yuan/hm 2 a), EC j is the value equivalent of item j ecosystem services of a definite type of land-use, E a is the economic value of a unit ecosystem service value equivalent factor as 2112.03 (yuan/hm 2 a). | Elasticity of ESV Response to LULC: To eliminate the uncertainty caused by land-use type in ESV assessment, this study uses the conception of elasticity coefficient in economics to calculate the coefficient sensitivity (CS) of ESV to ensuring the reliability of research results. The ESV changes in response to 50% adjustments of the ESV coefficients for each LULC type were assessed 
where ESV is the estimated total value of ecosystem services, VC is the value coefficient, and ""i,"" ""j"" and ""k"" represent the initial, adjusted values, and LUCC categories, respectively. If CS > 1, the estimated ESV is elastic concerning that coefficient. If CS ‚â§ 1, the estimated ESV is inelastic. Thus, when CS < 1, even if the accuracy of VC values used as proxy biomes is low, the results of the estimation are credible. | Results:  | Changes of LULC: The spatial distribution of LULC in Derong County from 1992 to 2018 was shown in Figure  | Results:  | Changes of LULC: The spatial distribution of LULC in Derong County from 1992 to 2018 was shown in Figure 
From 1992 to 2018, forestland, water body, built-up land, cropland, and snow increased, while shrubland and grassland decreased. With agricultural economic development and urban expansion, the built-up land and cropland increased significantly. The built-up land has changed the most, increasing by 2679.68 hm 2 and with an increase rate of 294.09% by 1992. The cropland also increased by 2061.26 hm 2 and with an increase rate of 45.57% by 1992. The shrubland decreased most by 21403.66 hm 2 and with a decrease rate of 20.45% by 1992.
The results of land-use dynamics from 1992 to 2018 showed that shrubland and grassland decreased, with dynamics of -0.79% and -0.22%, respectively. The other landuse types increased, and the order of increasing speed was: Built-up land > cropland > snow > forestland > water body, with dynamic degrees of 11.31%, 1.75%, 0.94%, 0.44%, and 0.39%, respectively. | Changes of ESV: LULC change causes the variation of ecosystem service value. As can be seen from Table 
Soil and water conservation, the implementation of forest projects, and comprehensive ecological management have promoted the restoration of forestland and water body, and the increase in the ESV of forestland and water body. Agricultural economic development and urban expansion have led to the reduction of shrubland and grassland areas and associated ESVs.

As can be seen from Table  | Ecosystem Sensitivity Analysis: After adjusting the value factors of ecosystem services for each land-use type by 50%, respectively (Table 
This study conducts a temporal and spatial quantitative study on the ESV of Derong County, which has certain theoretical and practical significance for restoring and protecting the ecosystem of Derong County and accelerating the comprehensive management of the ecological environment in Derong County. The research results help people more intuitively understand the importance of ecosystem services in Derong County, and at the same time, provides a scientific reference for the effective protection and management of ecosystems in the area and the sustainable use of land resources. The intuitive monetary value highlights the importance of Derong County's land resources to the regional economy and ecology and also provides a scientific theoretical basis for the protection and management of land ecosystems in countries around the world. | Limitations and Future Work: The ESV assessment methods used in this study can be used for rapid spatial analysis, assessment, and quantification of long-term ecological benefit restoration. This research is of great significance to the optimization of regional land-use patterns, maintenance of regional ecological security, and sustainable development. It is of enormous meaning for the ecological protection and construction of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, especially for the ecological construction of dry-hot valley regions. Meanwhile, this study provides a case for assessing the impacts of the LULU on ESV, which has a certain reference value for the formulation of land-use policies. Next, we will conduct research on the impact of other factors (such as altitude, climate change) on the ESV. The shortcomings of the current research are as follows:  | Conclusions: With the support of Landsat TM/OLI remote sensing data and GIS technology, this study conducted a quantitative analysis of the temporal and spatial changes in ESV caused by LULC in Derong County from 1992 to 2018. The major study results showed as follows: (1) From 1992 to 2018, the ESV with an overall decrease of 0.25 √ó 10 8 yuan, and the most severe decline in the value density of ESV was in Dianyagong. (2) Ecological projects have played a positive role in improving ESV in Derong county. (3) Of the 11 individual ecosystem service values, the value contribution rate of climate regulation was the largest. (4) The sensitivity indexes were all less than 1, and the results were reliable. To continue to improve the ecological restoration in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and achieve sustainable development in the dry-hot valley area, it is necessary to strengthen soil and water conservation, natural forest protection projects, and other ecological restoration measures, and to provide better ecological well-being for local communities."," (, ) || The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital (, , , , , , , , , , 1997) || The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital (, , , , , , , , , , 1998) || Changes in the global value of ecosystem services (, , , , , , , , 2014) || Evaluation of forest ecosystem services in Mediterranean areas.

Land Use Policy,Shawky Mansour; Mohammed Al-Belushi; Talal Al-Awadhi,"As a result of the socioeconomic transformation, the rapid urban expansion of cities and towns in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states has predominately led to tremendous pressure on the limited natural resources and loss of productive lands. Indeed, the spatial patterns of urbanisation and their impacts on mountain resources and environment have received little attention, particularly in Oman. Predicting urban growth in the mountainous cities has the potential to better understand the interaction between the spatial growth patterns and the mountain topography. This study aims to analyse spatiotemporal dynamics of land use/land cover (LULC) (2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015)(2016)(2017)(2018) and simulate urban expansion  in Nizwa city, Al Dakhliyah governorate, Oman. Cellular Automata (CA)-Markov and geospatial techniques were utilised to assess and project urban growth and land cover changes. The analysis was based on three maps of LULC at equal intervals derived from satellite imageries: Landsat TM for 1998, 2008 and 2018, along with topographic spatial layers (elevation, aspects, and terrain slopes) derived from the ASTER digital elevation model. In addition, other spatial parameters (population density, proximity to urban centres, and proximity to major roads,) were incorporated in the simulation process. The findings revealed that the actual LULC change during 2008-2018 was 12,014 ha of net urban growth (418.5 % change), while the simulated change was expected to be 14,985 ha by 2028, with a total of 37,465 ha increase in the built-up area and urban growth by 2038. Although the topographic variability will control LULC changes, the urban expansion overly will occupy the arable land across the valleys along with the flat areas. During the next two decades, the built-up areas will dominant, with a large percentage of vacant land (net loss 12,813 ha) and vegetation cover (net loss 35 ha) will be gradually converted into residential land use. The output of the simulations in this research could serve not only as spatial guidelines for monitoring future trends of LULC dynamics, but also address the threats and deteriorates of urban sustainability in the Omani mountainous cities. Furthermore, identifying bare soils and vegetation areas that are susceptible to urbanisation is of value for the national strategy of future urban planning in Oman.","Introduction and theoretical framework: Globally, the percentage of the urban population has dramatically increased from 14 % in 1900 to 29.1 % in 1950, reaching 54 % in 2014 and is expected to increase to 66 % in 2050 
According to terrain and morphology, urban patterns in developing countries can be classified into various types, particularly coasts, deserts, plains, mountains, and upland. However, urban dynamics in mountainous cities remain poorly investigated and understood. Mountains cover a quarter of the earth surface, with almost 12 % of the world populations living in mountains and areas that are located in high elevations. Globally, populations living in mountainous urban zones are gradually increasing 
Since the recent oil boom 
During the last decade, an obvious shift in the urban population has taken place in Oman. In 2016, Oman had the highest annual urban population growth (6.43 %) in the world, with the urban population reaching 83.56 % in 2017. Moreover, almost 25 % of the Omani urban population live in large cities 
The majority of urban agglomerations in most Omani cities are characterised by scattered settlements that are incomplete, not only with regard to service provision but also in spatial accessibility 
Urban sprawl and expansion of unplanned built-up areas over mountain valleys and basins certainly exerted tremendous pressure on the natural landscape 
There is a lack of research regarding urban growth across the mountains of Oman, thus, this study aims to analyse spatiotemporal changes of mountainous urban in Oman using satellite images, employing advanced GIS algorithms. Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamic of LULC and predicting future urbanisation are crucial, particularly for sustainable development, formulating national development policies, and urban planning strategies. The study analysis adopts the Markov chain modelling technique, an effective method for quantitative simulation 
-To what extent are the substantial changes in the mountain landscape due to urban growth along the Omani mountainous cities? -What are the spatiotemporal divergences of LULC changes? -What is the nature and trends of future urban growth in the Omani mountainous areas?
Spatial modelling and simulation have been used to address these research questions and the pattern and mechanism of mountainous urban growth in Oman can provide an important basis for identifying driving forces of expansion. In addition, such analysis can provide decision-makers with clear visions of controlling unplanned urban sprawl and promoting sustainable urban development and proper land management.
A large body of literature has investigated land use dynamics as these changes have direct influences on population well-being and quality of life through the extent to which ecosystem elements are in balance. For instance, measuring and assessing the consequences of land use changes on natural resource preservation, production from agricultural land, air pollution, and access to potable water etc. have been previously reported (e.g. 
A second line of research on LULC changes has focused on understanding the impacts of land changes on environmental systems and communities 
In recent decades, urban agglomerations in the GCC states (e.g., Oman, UAE and Saudi Arabia) as well as cities have recorded higher rates of urban growth 
Regarding spatial algorithms, spatial models and advanced GIS methods have been widely employed to explain LULC patterns, distribution and directions as well as predict the amount of land use changes. For example, the multisystem agent model combines the cellular landscape with agent-based simulation to optimise the decision making process of LULC dynamics 
A more comprehensive investigation and description of the urban fabric, design and structure of cities in the GCC can be found in the literature (e.g. 
Ultimately, explicit modelling research on spatial drivers, geographical factors and future predictions of the comprehensive urban process in the Omani cities and urban clusters has not been conducted. Specifically, the dynamics of mountainous urban patterns and its associated processes need to be spatially investigated. Consequently, the present study, through the integrated GIS and image processing approach, is the first attempt to bridge the gap in existing literature by simulating, modelling and predicting LULC dynamics of mountainous urban area in Oman. Monitoring and simulating urban growth across the mountainous cities of Oman result in useful information and spatial guidelines for decision-makers and policy managers not only in domains of urban sprawl, housing planning, and provision of public infrastructure but also in other critical issues in the mountainous cities such as ecological balance, vegetation shrinking and land degradation in urban areas. | Study area: Oman is mountainous, with most of the populous places located in mountain valleys and basins. The physical landscape of Oman is characterised by two large mountain ranges, Al Hajar Al Sharqy and Al Hajar Al Gharbi mountains (Eastern and western rocky or stone mountains), which cover the northern eastern and western part of the country. Al Jabal Al Akhdr, which is more than 3000 m height, is the highest mountain in the region (Fig. 
The study area covers about 448.4 square kilometres including all urban agglomeration around Nizwa city is located in between latitudes of 22¬∞55‚Ä≤ 59 N and the longitude of 57¬∞31‚Ä≤ 59 E. It is an ancient city and located in the heart of Al Dakhliyah governorate at a crossroads between Muscat and the Hajar mountain range in the northern part of Oman. The city is the regional centre of the governorate and the largest city, located on the fringes of Al Jabal Al Akhdr Mountain, approximately 164 km from the capital Muscat. The total population of Nizwa city increased from 84,528 in 2010 to 123,396 inhabitants in 2017 
The climate is characterised as hot in the summer, with pleasant average temperatures in winter and rain fall, especially in the mountainous region of Al Jabal Al Akhdr. On average, the warmest month is July, while the coldest is January (World climates, 2019). The traditional market of Nizwa located in the city centre is famous for handicrafts, souvenirs and antiques and other items, and is the main tourist attraction in the city. The most important landscape feature in the city is Nizwa's splendid fort, which is one of the oldest and most impressive castles in the Sultanate of Oman, located in the inner part of the city and was built in 1660. Nizwa is famous for having the largest popular markets in Oman which include several local products, crafts and traditional industries, as well as gold and silver jewelry, wood and copper industry, textile and palm industries. Nizwa Fruit & Vegetable Market is the newest market built on the highest architectural specifications and play a crucial role in retail trading and linking rural to urban. In addition to small enterprises and retail activities, the city is also known as one of the top tourist destinations in Oman where various ancient monuments are located particularly castles, caves, forts, and waterfalls.
Topographically, the study area can be divided into three distinct regions: the mountainous area located to the north and northeast (Fig.  | Methods of data acquisition and analysis: Landsat images 
The Landsat images of L1T indicates precision and terrain corrected data which provides systematic radiometric and geometric accuracy by incorporating ground control points (GCPs). A rectification and georeferencing process for 1998, 2008, and 2018 Landsat images was performed using 8, 12, and 15 ground-control points respectively. The digital topographic map of 1:50 000 scale and the Global Positing System (GPS) were the source of the selected GCPs. Generally, road intersections, valleys, hills and building of public infrastructure were identified as major GCPs and these references are located near the corners and the middle of the study area. Comparisons of the GCPs points against common points in the images revealed that georeferencing was accurate within 1 pixel (15 m). The vector map layers were generated using various vector and grid data formats, such as population settlements and density, highways and roads, urban centres, and digital elevation model (DEM) 30 m resolution which was used to generate slopes, aspects and area elevation. In this analysis, LULC classification was implemented based on five classes and a brief description of major LULC classes is provided in Table  | Suitability maps: The formation of suitability maps for each land use class is influenced by spatial factors and constraints, with the parameters denoting the suitability of a location to be developed using continuous values (Fig. 
Suitability criteria were used to define the suitability of land use changes of a specific LULC class for each pixel, with 0 representing no suitability and 255 indicates the highest suitability of land use changes (Fig.  | Markov chain (MC): In order to predict LULC changes across the study area, CA Markov method was performed within Terrset software package. The Markov model is a stochastic model used to simulate randomly changing and continuous surfaces. It is also a theory based on the assumption that the future state of any object depends mainly upon the current state, not on the previous states. In LULC changes, the model describes quantities of conversion states between land classes and calculates rates of transfer among various land use types 
Fig. 
Where S (t), S (t + 1) are the phenomenon or system status at time t or t +1; P ij is the transition probability matrix in a state which is calculated as the following: (2)
Where, P is the Markov transition matrix, i,j is the LULC type in the first and second time, P ij denotes the probability of LULC type i to change into type j, N refers to the number of LULC classes in the region. | Cellular automata-Markov (CA-Markov): Markov chain alone is not sufficient for simulation and predicting of LULC dynamics because it does not consider spatial distribution of each land category or the spatial direction of growth  | LULCij: The transformation of cells from time t to another t + 1 is a function of its cell state, its neighbourhood proximity, and a set of transition rules. The evolution of cells can be calculated as follows: | ( ) .( ) .( ) ): Where + t 1 LULCi j , indicates the potential status of cell i.j to change at time t + 1 while t LULCi j , represents states of cell i.j at time t. t Si j , illustrates suitability indices of cell i.j at time t. t Px y i j , , , specifies the probability of cell i.j to change from x to y. t Nij denotes a neighbourhood index of cell i.j.
In CAM model, the transition rule is computed according to suitability indices, neighbourhood indices, and transition probabilities.
In this study, the multi criteria evaluation (MCE) suitability maps were created utilising weighted linear combination as follows:
.
Where t Si j , represents suitability index for cell i.j at time t, while tx i j , refers to a score of criteria m for cell i.j at time t. w m indicates the weight which is given to each criteria and c m signifies a Boolean value of growth constraints.
The transition rule was also calculated based on the transition potential of each cell, which is calculated based on changes of LULC classes of two periods as follows:  | Table 2: Characteristics of land use/land cover (LULC) types. | LULC type Description: Built-up area Developed environment including all residential, commercial and industrial areas, urban agglomerations and transportation infrastructure Vegetation Total plant cover which encompasses mixed palm trees, gardens, inner city recreational areas, cultivated lands, grasslands, and agricultural areas Bare land
Open land that has no buildings and is not being used, often bare soils, it can be used for several purposes, particularly for residential, agricultural and industrial use Rocky land
Land dominated by rocky blocks or consists of large areas of rock which almost cover the entire landscape Mountains Large landforms that rise above the surrounding lands and rugged terrains activity a y.
The third element of calculating the transition rule is the neighbourhood indices which is calculated as follows:
The t Ni j , was computed based on the extended Moore neighbourhoods which is a contiguity 5 √ó 5 filter, that is, each cell is surrounded by a matrix which composed by 5 √ó 5. A Moore neighborhood filter was utilized to capture local interaction among cells. The filter is a regular squared lattice and it is composed of a central cell and eight surrounding cells. This size of the neighbourhood was applied since it allows the influences of surrounding cells on the central one. | Findings:  | Model validation: To validate the model and evaluate its reliability in predicting LULC for projected years 2028 and 2038, the observed maps of the actual LULC for the year 2008 and 2018 were compared with the projected map for the same years. The validation process was based on the Kappa Index of Agreement (KIA), which is widely utilised in validating LULC predictions (e.g. 
In this study, the validation process was computed to the total LULC classes using the validate function in Terrset software. The Kappa statistics (K) were assessed to measure how closely the instances classified between actual and projected maps of the years 2008 and 2018 (Fig. 
Although all Kappa parameters in 2018 were higher than 2008, they were all higher than 0.8 in both years, ranging from 0.8050 to 0.9170, which can be described as substantial agreement to almost perfect agreement  | Transition probability matrices: From the transition probabilities between maps of 1998 and 2008, the transition probability matrix for 2008 was computed following Eqs. 4 and 5. The Markov matrix (Table 
The transition probabilities matrix between 2008 and 2018 for predicting LULC changes in 2028 and 2038 is presented in Table 
Proximity to major roads J-shape decreasing 100 m to 2.5 km = high suitability 2.5 km to 5 km = decreasing suitability 5 km to 8.5 km = lowest suitability Land close to highway and major roads is more accessible and more valuable; consequently, suitable for housing and urban growth

Slopes J-shape decreasing 0 degree to 21 degree = high suitability 22 degree to 31 degree = decreasing suitability 32 km to 73 degree = lowest suitability The steeper the slopes, the less suitable the land for urban growth; the lower the slopes, the more suitable for residential and build up expansion  | LULC dynamics: The dynamic changes of LULC categories for the years 2008, 2018, 2028, and 2038 are presented in Fig. 
Fig.  | LULC future predictions: The transition probability matrix of 2008-2018 was used to predict LULC changes in the future 20 years up to 2038. The map of 2018 was set as a starting year to forecast LULC changes in 2028. Similarly, to predict urban dynamics in 2038, the map of 2028 was set as a starting year utilising the same transition probability matrix of the 2008-2018 period. According to the successful simulation of LULC change patterns and distribution in 2018, future changes of urban landscape were projected across the study area from 2018 till 2038 (Fig. 
Fig.  | Discussion: One of the main aims of this research was to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of urban expansion in the mountainous regions of Oman. Landsat images 
The dynamic of built-up areas is associated with urban population growth 
Land use dynamics in the mountainous cities of Oman describe the influences of human footprints on ecological, hydrological and environmental structures, where the higher the level of intensively land use changes, the more destructive effects on the ecological balance of   urban environment 
The rapid consumption of space and natural resources in the Omani mountainous cities due to ongoing urbanisation is not only a major challenge of sustainable development, but also a burden for future strategic plans of 2020 and 2040. Evidently, the expansion of urban areas need to be equipped with sufficient basic infrastructure, mainly transportation, water, energy and other social amenities. Similar studies conducted elsewhere in developing countries 
Overall, the present study provides new insights into simulating LULC dynamics of mountainous urban areas. To the best of our knowledge, research on spatial analysis and LULC prediction in Oman generally is very rare. Consequently, these findings contribute new  understanding and have several key implications for research on urban planning of mountainous cities in Oman as well as in neighbouring countries. Using advanced GIS and image processing metric techniques to identify areas that are susceptible to urbanisation is invaluable for the national strategy of future urban planning. In addition, the output of the simulations in this research could serve not only as spatial guidelines for monitoring future trends of LULC dynamics, but also to address threats and deterioration of urban sustainability in mountainous cities. Image spatial resolution remains a key factor which directly influences spatial metrics, landscape details and analysis output  | Conclusion: During the last decade, Omani cities have experienced unprecedented urban expansion due to socioeconomic transformation, mega projects and consistent immigration to urban areas. Accordingly, there is growing pressure on major urban agglomerations, placing intense demand on vacant lands for housing development. Geospatial simulation is an important technique to model and forecast urban growth and its consequences on future planning and sustainable development. In this research, the integration of remote sensing and advanced GIS techniques with the CA-Markov model successfully simulated urban growth and LULC changes in Nizwa city. The model was validated with 2018 observed data and showed satisfactory reliability. The findings indicated that the spatial patterns of urbanisation in the study area were influenced by terrain, topography, and transportation network. In addition, the major urban expansion occurred across vegetation areas, substantially along open spaces and bare lands.
In the mountainous cities of Oman such as Nizwa, the urbanisation can lead to a sprawl pattern because of rugged terrains, higher slopes, hilltops and unsuitable topographies. The settlements often are surrounded by mountain ranges, thus flat lands close to existing urban centres are dramatically shrunk by the urban sprawl. The negative impact of urban sprawl, such as destroying vegetation and urban ecosystem, should be avoided. Planners and policy makers must consider the high risks of landslides, flash floods and difficulties of spatial accessibilities to basic and public services. Consequently, effective management policies should be adopted for tackling the urban sprawl expansions and the shrinking of green spaces and vacant lands, for example, providing residents with land for housing should be regulated based on spatial guidelines adopting planned locations that pose little development challenges.
To the best of our knowledge, research regarding spatial modelling of mountainous cities in Oman is very rare. This analysis employed advanced GIS techniques, spatial modelling and utilisation of satellite images in the simulations of LULC changes to successfully predict the future of urban growth. The modelling process gave promisingly accurate and reliable results for examining possible future urban changes, allowing urban landscape patterns and growth directions to be identified and predicted. These results can provide a great opportunity for addressing the future challenges of the urban mountainous environment, its sustainability and growth scenarios. The simulated results of this study can be employed to assess urban planning policies in the mountainous cities of Oman and the surrounding regions. Likewise, the produced results of this research can serve as an indispensable guideline for local governors and planners to manage the spatiotemporal directions of urban expansion and their future ramifications.

Analyses of land use land cover (LULC) change and built-up expansion in the suburb of a metropolitan city: Spatio-temporal analysis of Delhi NCR using landsat datasets,Waseem Mohd; Mohd Naikoo; Mohammad Rihan; Shahfahad Ishtiaque,"During past four decades, in post economic reforms period, Delhi and its surrounding regions has attracted a large number of populations which led to the rapid transformation of its LULC pattern. Therefore, this study is aimed to analyze the LULC changes during 1990-2018 as well as the growth and pattern of built-up surfaces in relation to the population growth and migration in the suburbs of Delhi metropolitan city which is also known as the National Capital Region (NCR). The Landsat 5 (TM) and Landsat 8 (OLI/TIRS) data has been used for the LU/LC classification of Delhi NCR. The K means clustering technique was applied on the Landsat data for the LULC classification and then the change detection technique was used to quantify the LULC change.
The result shows that the considerable changes in LULC have occurred with continuous increase in built-up area and open/fallow land and decrease in agriculture land and vegetation over the study time period. Built-up area increased by about 326 percent and open/fallow land by 44 percent while the agricultural land and vegetation cover have decreased by 12 percent and 34 percent of the total area of study respectively during the study period. Built-up area has mostly increased at the expense of agricultural land and vegetation cover while vegetation cover has been transformed into Built-up area, Ridge and Agriculture. The statistical analysis shows that the association between built-up expansion and the population and migrants varies from weak to high but the coefficient of determination was always positive.","Introduction: Though the environmental transformation of earth by human activities began in late-Pleistocene, it increased with the emergence of agriculture and urbanized societies 
The global changes are brought about as a consequence of the LULC changes which are being driven by the human to fulfil their need for food, water, fibre and shelter 
The LULC changes have shown to have both direct and indirect impacts on the various aspects of environment 
Numerous studies have analyzed the quantitative and qualitative changes in the LULC pattern and its drivers using different approaches and techniques. 
Population density of Delhi has increased from 6352 persons per sq. Km in 1991-11,297 per sq. Km in 2011 (Census of India, 2011). It had resulted not only in the formation of separate and extended regional planning Unit which is called National Capital Region or Delhi NCR  | Study area: Delhi NCR is the Indian central planning region comprising of National Capital Territory Delhi in its core with 18 adjacent districts from the states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan surrounding it (Fig. 
In NCR, Delhi has the dominances of impermeable concrete surfaces comprising of residential, industrial and commercial areas in its land use  | Materials and methods:  | Materials: For 1990 and 2003 the Landsat 5 (TM) data while for 2018, the Landsat 8 (OLI/TIRS) data downloaded from United States Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Explorer has been used in this study for LULC mapping and change analysis. The spatial resolution of Landsat TM data was 30 m and OLI/TIRS data was 15 m (after incorporating the panchromatic band). The data were downloaded for same season of the each study year, i.e. March or April months. The details of the satellite data used in this study are given in Table  | Methods:  | Method for land use land cover (LULC) classification: LULC classification is one of the methods for obtaining the information from satellite imageries  | Accuracy assessment: The post classification accuracy assessment is an important part of the LULC classification and mapping which is used to analyze the precision of the classified maps 
In this study, Kappa coefficient technique is used to evaluate the accuracy of LULC maps of Delhi-NCR using 400 randomly selected points. The points were selected in a way that covers each LULC classes in almost equal proportion and from all parts of the study area. The ground observation for 1990 and 2003 were taken from Google Earth Pro domain as the field data was not available for these years. Further, for 2018, the ground observations were taken partially both from field visit as well as using Google Earth pro domain for the areas having either no or difficult access. The results of accuracy assessment show an overall accuracy level of 87.79 percent, 90.41 percent and 89.57 percent for 1990, 2003 and 2018, respectively and the corresponding Kappa statistics was 0.8763, 0.8909 and 0.8872, respectively. | Statistical analysis: To analyze the relationships between the LULC demographic changes, the linear regression technique has been performed using scatter plot technique on the Microsoft Excel (MS Excel) software 2010 version. In this study, the district-wise built-up area and population and migration data has been used for the year-wise regression analysis. For this the built-up area was extracted from the LULC maps prepared using Landsat (TM and OLI) data while the data of population and total migrants were taken from Census of India. The scatter plots are used to show the trend of linear relationship. The uphill trend line shows the positive linear relationship between the variables while the downhill trend line shows the opposite. The magnitude of the relationship is calculated by the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) which can be high, medium or low.    | Dynamics of land use land cover (LULC) change: In general NCR has witnessed changes in all the LULC categories but maximum changes have been witnessed in Built-up. Built-up area has witnessed a gigantic growth of 114 percent from 1990 to 2003 and 99.02 percent from 2003 to 2018, making an overall growth of 326 percent during the study period (Table 
Fallow land is next to Built-up that has witnessed massive increase of 44 percent during the study period, however rate of increase    was 29.19 from 1990 to 2003 and 9.90 percent from 2003 to 2018. This growth is mostly at the expanse of agriculture which contributes to about 57.6 percent to the total increase of fallow land during the study period. While fallow land has witnessed an increase on western side it has undergone decrease on south-western side of the study area. The Vegetation cover has witnessed the maximum decrease of 34 percent among all the LULC classes during the study period however it decreased by 23 percent from 1990 to 2003 and 15.13 percent from 2003 to 2018 (Fig.  | Analysis association of built-up expansion with population and migration: For the analysis of association of built-up expansion with population growth and migration, the district-wise data of population, migration and built-up areas has been used. The Delhi NCR covers 34 districts; 11 districts of Delhi, 2 districts of Rajasthan, 13 districts of Haryana and 8 districts of Uttar Pradesh state. The result shows that the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) varies from very low to high. The association between total migrants and built-up area was positive but very weak (0.03) in 1990 while it was moderate and positive (0.44) in 2003 and high positive (0.56) in 2018 (Fig.  | Discussion: In India, the urbanization has taken place at an unprecedented rate during past few decades, especially after the economic reforms of 1991 
The maximum expansion of built-up area has been noticed from the Gautam Buddha Nagar district in which the fast growing Noida city is located and the NCT of Delhi, located in the centre of NCR. Both these cities (Noida and Delhi) have experienced rapid urbanization during the past few decades due to population growth and economic development 
Land is the main and primary natural resource available for human and is utilized in various ways for various purposes. Thus any change in human population directly affects the land and land use pattern of an area  | Conclusion: This comprehensive study is done to examine the Spatio-temporal pattern of LULC changes in Delhi NCR, which is an inter-state planning region and has experienced rapid population growth and economic development during past decades. The land use land cover (LULC) maps were prepared using Landsat 5 (TM) and Landsat 8 (OLI/TIRS) satellite data and then the change matrix was calculated. The result shows that LULC pattern of the Delhi NCR has been altered significantly during the study period. The maximum change is noticed from the built-up area which has increased to about 326.65 percent, followed by open/fallow land which is increased by about 41.98 percent during 1990-2018. At the same time the vegetation cover, water bodies and agricultural land are declined by -34.84, -22.51 and -12.44 percent, respectively, while the ridge part has noticed a negligible decline in its area. The result also shows that the agricultural land and fallow land are the major contributors in the growth of built-up area, as the built-up area has expanded mostly over these land use classes, while the vegetation cover also has significant contribution in built-up expansion. Further, the analysis of relationship between built-up and population distribution shows that in 1990 and 2003, the association was positive but weak but in 2018, relationship significant and positive. On the other hand, the relationship between total migrants and built-up distribution was weak in 1990, but is moderate and positive in 2003 and high-positive in 2018. This implies that the increasing migration is the major determinant of built-up expansion; however, it does not completely determine the built-up expansion and land use change. Thus the authors suggests for the future research to incorporate the data of economic growth and industrial development (like number of industries) in the study of LULC change of such region with high economic and administrative importance.

Comparison of Land Use Land Cover Classifiers Using Different Satellite Imagery and Machine Learning Techniques,Sana Basheer; Xiuqu Wang; Aitazaz Farooque; Rana Nawaz; Kai Liu; Toyin Adekanmbi; Suqi Liu,"Accurate land use land cover (LULC) classification is vital for the sustainable management of natural resources and to learn how the landscape is changing due to climate. For accurate and efficient LULC classification, high-quality datasets and robust classification methods are required. With the increasing availability of satellite data, geospatial analysis tools, and classification methods, it is essential to systematically assess the performance of different combinations of satellite data and classification methods to help select the best approach for LULC classification. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the LULC classification performance of two commonly used platforms (i.e., ArcGIS Pro and Google Earth Engine) with different satellite datasets (i.e., Landsat, Sentinel, and Planet) through a case study for the city of Charlottetown in Canada. Specifically, three classifiers in ArcGIS Pro, including support vector machine (SVM), maximum likelihood (ML), and random forest/random tree (RF/RT), are utilized to develop LULC maps over the period of 2017-2021. Whereas four classifiers in Google Earth Engine, including SVM, RF/RT, minimum distance (MD), and classification and regression tree (CART), are used to develop LULC maps for the same period. To identify the most efficient and accurate classifier, the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient for each classifier is calculated throughout the study period for all combinations of satellite data, classification platforms, and methods. Change detection is then conducted using the best classifier to quantify the LULC changes over the study period. Results show that the SVM classifier in both ArcGIS Pro and Google Earth Engine presents the best performance compared to other classifiers. In particular, the SVM in ArcGIS Pro shows an overall accuracy of 89% with Landsat, 91% with Sentinel, and 94% with Planet. Similarly, in Google Earth Engine, the SVM shows an accuracy of 87% with Landsat 8 and 92% with Sentinel 2. Furthermore, change detection results show that 13.80% and 14.10% of forest areas have been turned into bare land and urban class, respectively, and 3.90% of the land has been converted into the urban area from 2017 to 2021, suggesting the intensive urbanization. The results of this study will provide the scientific basis for selecting the remote sensing classifier and satellite imagery to develop accurate LULC maps.","Introduction: Accurate information on land use land cover (LULC) can facilitate various research activities related to floods, droughts, migration, and climate change at several scales. The constant and precise investigation of LULC is a vital aspect of any region's sustainability and development. LULC changes (i.e., deforestation and urbanization, etc.) are one the prominent drivers of climate change around the globe 
The severity of extreme events is mainly modulated by the LULC changes. The extreme events of heat waves in 2003 and 2010 in Western Europe and Russia inspired researchers to investigate extreme events by looking at the LULC of the area 
Analysis of different LULC categories, using machine learning approaches, can be performed in a geographic information system platform (i.e., ArcGIS Pro) or Google Earth Engine using remote sensing datasets. The geographic information system can be used for a better understanding of spatial and temporal analysis related to LULC classification 
Recently, state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms (i.e., random forest/random tree (RF/RT), classification and regression tree (CART), support vector machine (SVM), maximum likelihood (ML), and minimum distance (MD)) have captured the researchers' attention  | Data and Methods:  | Study Area: This study focuses on Charlottetown, the capital of Prince Edward Island (PEI), commonly known as the Island, a province of Canada located in the Maritimes (Figure  | Satellite Data: This project will employ three types of datasets to perform LULC categorization. These datasets include low (Landsat 8), median (Sentinel 2), and high (Planet) resolution satellite images. In this research, all visible and infrared bands (the thermal infrared band was excluded) were used for the LULC analysis  | Methodological Framework for LULC Classification: Currently, geospatial Big Data are garnering an abundance of attention and are emphasized globally. ArcGIS Pro and Google Earth Engine are the most popular platforms for large data processing and LULC classification. Several approaches have been established and employed to measure changes in different LULC changes. However, there is currently no research that uses both platforms and includes different input datasets to examine the accurate LULC changes through time in Charlottetown, PEI. In this study, a framework was developed to compare and analyze the performance and viability of different classification methods in ArcGIS Pro and Google Earth Engine, using different datasets. Table  | Classification Methods: To perform a pixel-based supervised classification, a set of training samples specific to each year was obtained. Every training sample pixel was assigned to a LULC class on the basis of supplementary data, such as Google Street View and orthophoto images from each year of the study  | ‚Ä¢: Classification and regression tree (CART) is a decision classification tree that facilitates straightforward decision-making and regression analyses  | ‚Ä¢: Random forest/random tree (RF/RT) RF/RT constructs an ensemble classifier and is one of the commonly used classifiers  | ‚Ä¢: Support vector machine (SVM). One of the supervised learning techniques is SVM which is used to resolve different problems related to regression and classifications.
In the training phase, SVM classifiers generate an ideal hyperplane that splits several classes with the less misclassified pixels from input datasets. The kernel functions, cost parameters, and gamma  | ‚Ä¢: Minimum distance classifier (MD). The MD classifier classifies imagery datasets into classes that reduce the distance between the class in multi-feature space and image data. This distance between the image data is expressed as a similarity index, such that the minimal distance and highest similarity are equivalent. The main idea behind this process is to calculate the spectral distance between the measurement vector for the candidate pixel and the mean vector for each signature 
‚Ä¢ Maximum likelihood classifier (ML). Maximum likelihood classifier is a supervised classification method that describes every band by a normal distribution. This supervised classification method is based on the Byes theorem  | Data Processing: In Google Earth Engine, LULC classification maps were generated using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 imagery. We use SVM, RF, MD, and CART classifiers in Google Earth Engine. Contaminated pixels caused by cloud cover were eliminated from all images using the cloud mask method provided on the Google Earth Engine 
Using SVM, RT, and ML classifiers, LULC maps were created in ArcGIS Pro. As the major input for classification, images with the least or zero cloud cover were employed. Atmospherically and geometrically corrected images from the three sources (Landsat 8, Sentinel 2, and Planet) with zero cloud cover were utilized as the primary input. The source of data was USGS and Planet Scope sites. Images from the Planet Scope site were mosaiced to cover the whole study area in ArcGIS Pro. Then, all images from all three data sources were clipped to the city of Charlottetown boundary using ArcGIS Pro for LULC classification. Image treatment is entirely independent in ArcGIS Pro than in Google Earth Engine.
A total of 354 training samples were used for LULC classification, from which 284 were used as training samples, and 145 were used as testing samples. Google Earth Pro was used to visually evaluate high-resolution orthophoto images from 2017 to 2021. Training and validation samples were generated with Google Earth Pro. They were then loaded into ArcGIS Pro and the Google Earth Engine platform as shape files to train classifiers. As a rule

Figure  | Change Detection: There are a variety of approaches for detecting LULC changes using different satellite image data  | Conclusions: The climate around the globe has been modified by human activities through the LULC changes. The LULC changes (i.e., deforestation, urbanization, etc.) played an important role in climate change since the pre-industrial era

ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing,Collin Homer; Jon Dewitz; Suming Jin; George Xian; Catherine Costello; Patrick Danielson; Leila Gass; Michelle Funk; James Wickham; Stephen Stehman; Roger Auch; Kurt Riitters,"Products reveal that land cover change is significant across most land cover classes and time periods. The land cover product was validated using existing reference data from the legacy NLCD 2011 accuracy assessment, applied to the 2011 epoch of the NLCD 2016 product line. The legacy and new NLCD 2011 overall accuracies were 82% and 83%, respectively, (standard error (SE) was 0.5%), demonstrating a small but significant increase in overall accuracy. Between 2001 and 2016, the CONUS landscape experienced significant change, with almost 8% of the landscape having experienced a land cover change at least once during this period. Nearly 50% of that change involves forest, driven by change agents of harvest, fire, disease and pests that resulted in an overall forest decline, including increasing fragmentation and loss of interior forest. Agricultural change represented 15.9% of the change, with total agricultural spatial extent showing only a slight increase of 4778 km 2 , however there was a substantial decline (7.94%) in pasture/hay during this time, transitioning mostly to cultivated crop. Water and wetland change comprised 15.2% of change and represent highly dynamic land cover classes from epoch to epoch, heavily influenced by precipitation. Grass and shrub change comprise 14.5% of the total change, with most change resulting from fire. Developed change was the most persistent and permanent land change increase adding almost 29,000 km 2 over 15 years (5.6% of total CONUS change), with southern states exhibiting expansion much faster than most of the northern states. Temporal rates of developed change increased in 2001-2006 at twice the rate of 2011-2016, reflecting a slowdown in CONUS economic activity. Future NLCD plans include increasing monitoring frequency, reducing latency time between satellite imaging and product delivery, improving accuracy and expanding the variety of products available in an integrated database.","Introduction: Change in land use and land cover type alters biophysical surface characteristics and can lead to major consequences including intensification of climate change, land degradation, and changes to biological diversity and ecosystem services 
However, databases that support large area land system science monitoring are relatively rare. There are numerous initiatives to map land cover globally and regionally, but mapping is not always monitoring. Further, change detection is not monitoring unless it is developed into land cover data for more than two points in time. The complexity of developing a land change monitoring system able to support land system science for large areas (stable funding over long periods, considerable computing and storage capabilities, database management, research to support continued production and product development) perhaps explains why these land cover monitoring programs that cover large areas are rare. For example, 
NLCD has been providing nationwide data on land cover and land cover change in the U.S. at the native 30 m spatial resolution of Landsat since 2001 with 
The demand for longer temporal duration, more frequent, more accurate and consistent land cover classifications and corresponding change information continues to further drive the development of land system science monitoring. Improved data availability, computer technology innovation, and advanced science development have facilitated this trend 
1. 15 years of categorical land cover and land cover for 7 epochs 
The main objectives of this paper are: (1) to provide an overview of the NLCD 2016 product suite; (2) focus on the NLCD 2016 land cover product results; (3) report on the NLCD 2016 land cover accuracy; (4) analyze NLCD 2016 land cover change rates both spatially and thematically over the last 15 years; and (5) analyze land cover change patterns by land cover theme. Although this paper remains focused on the analysis of the NLCD land cover product, other related NLCD database products integral to the development of the land cover product are also described. The NLCD 2016 database provides a complete 15year record of spatially explicit change data for CONUS. The major patterns of CONUS land cover change described in this article are intended to provide summaries of change (i.e., area estimates) that are consistent with the spatially explicit patterns observable in the NLCD map products. Beyond this analysis, this database provides a wealth of opportunity for future assessments of land cover change at regional and local levels. | Methods: NLCD 2016 provides a suite of national products including land cover and land cover change, fractional forest canopy percentage, fractional developed impervious percentage, and fractional shrub and | Table 1: Large-area land cover mapping efforts suitable for reporting trends (see  | Product development: 2.1.1. Land cover a. Data sources
We produced land cover by Landsat Worldwide Reference System path/row geographies. Relevant Landsat 5, 7, and 8 images were obtained from the U.S Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat archive and processed to an Albers projection with Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. One leaf-on image was selected for each target year 
We compiled and created ancillary data from different sources. The ancillary data included NLCD legacy data 2001, 2006, and 2011, U.S Department of Agriculture (USDA) Cropland Data Layer (CDL) and Cultivated Crop Layer derivatives, Natural Resources Conservation Service Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) hydric soil, National Wetland Inventory (NWI), Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) fire date and severity, Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and derivatives such as slope and aspect, LANDFIRE Vegetation Change Tracker and Existing Vegetation Type (https://www.landfire.gov/), and some in-house specifically designed ancillary data layers such as the Wetland Potential Index (WPI), fire recovery zone strata, wetland zone strata, and sagebrush-dominated region 
Training data were derived for each land cover type for each epoch year using integrated information from the Landsat image of the target year, two spectral indices including Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), multiple spectral change products from two-date and multi-date change detections and spectral trajectory analysis. The process relied on the original 2001 classification and the integrated information described above to identify spectrally stable land cover pixels for each land cover class. If a pixel for each land cover class stayed within a given spectral mean threshold identified for that class, across the entire timeframe, these pixels were assumed unchanged and comprised training data across the 15-year timeframe. Alternatively, changed areas were trained separately for each year with this given set of unchanged pixels which supplied a decision tree classification for each epoch. Results from this classification were combined with pixels that were spectrally stable and unchanged from the original 2001 classification to complete each epoch product. Training data were also additionally refined using image objects derived from the same Landsat image date to ensure that pixelbased training data were representative of the larger land cover patch they resided in 
Decision tree classifications were performed with these training data using four primary independent variables that represented the temporal, spectral, spatial, and terrain dimensions. These included (a) 1986-target year disturbance year dataset at 2-3-year intervals, (b) Landsat image of the year, (c) compactness of Landsat image segmentation polygons, and (d) DEM and derivatives of slope and aspect. This classification was then further integrated with ancillary data and object-based information to produce the initial land cover map for each epoch. For further details, see  | c. Land cover post-processing: The initial land cover map derived from the decision tree classification process (above) required additional postprocessing before being completed. This postprocessing focused on integrating the spatial coherence (patch uniformity) of land cover labels for each epoch, the temporal consistency of land cover labels over time, and the logic of the land cover change trajectory. The process utilized information from spectral and spatial data, temporal change trajectory, expert knowledge, and ancillary data to refine the initial land cover and change labels through sets of rules. The postprocessing was conducted for each land cover type in succession, with higher confidence land cover labels taking precedence over lower confidence land cover labels. Confidence orders were decided based on mapping confidence in accuracy and are:
(1) water, (2) wetlands, (3) forest and forest transition classes, (4) permanent snow and ice, (5) agricultural lands, and (6) persistent shrubland and herbaceous 
Final refinement emphasized the overall quality and compatibility of land cover labeling of all pixels across the seven epochs from 2001 to 2016. This was done in three primary steps after postprocessing. The first step analyzed all seven epochs as a succession of two-date paired change results in order to identify gross differences that were likely errors. The second step analyzed all seven epochs as a complete succession trajectory by creating spatial-temporal objects across all years to check for reasonable temporal change trajectories, and to ensure that relevant pixels remained consistent within an object. The third step corrected regional issues identified during review with specific models (e.g., vineyards in California misclassified as grassland or forest). | Fractional products required for NLCD land cover a. Imperviousness product generation and crosswalk to four developed classes: Fractional impervious surface was used to define NLCD's four urban classes. This product was generated using high-resolution training data and Landsat spectral data in regression tree analysis. For NLCD 2016, several improvements were incorporated through all four dates of impervious surface, including removing inaccurate roads from previous generations, including newer, more spatially accurate road layers from Navteq, NavStreets (www.navmart.com), and incorporating areas of energy development with classified Landsat imagery over regions identified from FracTracker, an organization that provides geospatial data on oil and gas wells (www.fractracker.org). Additionally, all four epochs of imperviousness were visually assessed for omission and commission errors and corrected by hand editing if necessary.
Fractional imperviousness products were converted to categorical NLCD-developed land cover classes by thresholding the impervious surface percentage as (< 20% for developed open space, 20-49% for developed low intensity, 50-79% for developed medium intensity, and 80-100% for developed high intensity 
We quantified 9 rangeland components, including percent shrub, sagebrush, big sagebrush, herbaceous, annual herbaceous, litter, and bare ground cover, along with sagebrush and shrub heights, at 30 m resolution using regression trees (see 
Fractional rangeland products were then converted into three categorical NLCD land cover classes (barren, grass and shrub). This crosswalking process is described in  | Land cover product accuracy assessment: Accuracy assessment is standard practice for the NLCD project 
Reference data collected for NLCD 2011 version 1 were compared to map labels from NLCD 2011 version 2 to determine agreement. User's accuracy (UA), producer's accuracy (PA) (100 -omission error), and overall accuracy (OA) served as the measures of agreement. These agreement measures and associated standard errors were estimated from the stratified sample data using the formulas documented in  | Land cover change evaluation: The most critical part of land cover monitoring is measuring and understanding change patterns and trends. For the 2001-2016 land cover change results, we analyzed change trends for CONUS including change rate and change frequency, as well as temporal and spatial change patterns by land cover theme.
For CONUS, the total 2001-2016 change rate was calculated in three ways. (1). A simple percentage of total change across time for all classes was calculated by dividing the entire spatial footprint of change across all years by the total area. (2). The change rate and location by land cover class theme was developed from the NLCD land cover change index. This index was developed to provide a simple and comprehensive way to understand change across all 7 dates of land cover, by summarizing change into 11 change classes. These classes were put into a hierarchical order to help communicate thematic change impact, and the order included water, developed, wetland (emergent herbaceous wetland, woody wetland), agriculture (cultivated crop, pasture hay), rangeland grass and shrub, and forest (with two additional forest regeneration classes). This priority order dictates the change category a change pixel is assigned across the 7 epochs. For example, a change pixel was assigned to the water change index if it converted ""from or to water"" across the 7 epochs, regardless of when the change occurred or other land cover changes that occurred. Assignment of a change pixel to an index then proceeded according to the hierarchy, such that pixels assigned to the agriculture change index included ""from or to agriculture"" but not ""from or to water"" (as these pixels were already assigned to the water index), and so on down the hierarchy. Change theme classes are typically organized at the Anderson 1 
Land cover theme change was also analyzed to provide more specific change information, to demonstrate key land change results, and to examine patterns of land cover change. Analyzed land cover themes include forest, water, wetland, agricultural, shrub, herbaceous, and barren and are specified below.
Forest change -We calculated forest areal coverages and change extents for 2001-2016 from the three forest classes (deciduous, evergreen and mixed). However, one additional class (woody wet) was used to analyze forest fragmentation change. NLCD has been used extensively for forest change and fragmentation analyses within the Montr√©al Process (MPLO, 2015) and for U.S Forest Service (USFS) international reporting of forest fragmentation 
Water and wetland change -Water and wetlands are often closely connected, hence we analyzed both water and wetland extents and their changes within different drainage basins. The USGS Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) is a comprehensive aggregated collection of hydrologic unit data which defines the perimeters of drainage areas (hydrologic units), formed by the terrain and other landscape characteristics, at a 1:24,000 scale in the U.S. (https://www.usgs.gov/ core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography/). We used WBD 2digital Hydrologic Units at the HU2 hierarchical scale for 18 different watersheds across CONUS. NLCD 2016 datasets were then summarized for water extent, wetland extent, and their changes in each mapping years. We then focused on the connection between annual precipitation and water or wetland extent in every drainage basin using correlation analysis. Precipitation data were obtained from Daymet (https:// daymet.ornl.gov/). Total amounts of annual precipitation were calculated in these basins in each mapping epoch. A simple correlation between precipitation and water or wetland extent was calculated for the period from 2001 to 2016.
Agricultural change -We calculated areal coverages of cultivated crop and pasture/hay. We also analyzed the cropland change from 2001 to 2016 by grouping the data into four ""from and to"" change classes including: crop or pasture/hay to non-cropland, non-crop pasture/hay to crop//pasture/hay, pasture/hay to cropland, and cropland to pasture/hay.
Shrub, herbaceous, and barren change -Analysis for shrub, herbaceous, and barren class change was completed by examining spatial extent and abundance patterns across CONUS. These numbers were directly calculated from the CONUS raster files for each mapping period. | Results and discussion:  | Land cover change and distribution: A total of 435 Landsat path rows were analyzed across the conterminous U.S. to produce 7 epochs of land cover with 16 thematic classes between 2001 and 2016. Nominal leaf-on base image acquisition dates for the seven periods were similar, with 2001 being  | Table 2: Land cover extent (km 2 ) by class across seven epochs from 2001 to 2016. Urban class extents in 
During the 15-year time span, the frequency of change for each pixel across the seven land cover epochs also varies from one to six times (Fig.  | Land cover accuracy assessment: We applied the reference data collected for the NLCD 2011 accuracy assessment to the new version of the 2011 data that accompanies the NLCD 2016 product suite. The new classification methods developed for NLCD 2016 produced a quantifiable improvement in classification accuracy, with a small but significant increase in overall accuracy (Table

omission error but not for commission error, suggesting there was a moderate association between the spatial configuration of land cover change and the likelihood of accurately identifying change. | Land cover change analysis:  | Forests: Overall, forest theme change was the most frequently changing class consisting of 48.67% of total CONUS change across the 15-year period (Table 
The spatial extents of the three forest classes are different (Fig. 
-3.04%, 39,599 km 2 or -4.11%, and 223 km 2 or -0.08%, respectively. The total forest extent declined about 63,537 km 2 or -3.12%. These patterns mirror the U.S. wood industry trends which are based primarily on soft-wood (evergreen) species such as Southern pines-led by loblolly pine-and Douglas fir in the Pacific Northwest. Overall, during the study period, about 70% of the U.S. wood production was from softwoods and 30% from hardwoods (deciduous forest), with domestic production peaking in 2005 and declining drastically with the recent deep economic recession (2009 the low point) and rebounding by 2016 but still considerably lower than the 2005 high  | Agriculture: The total 2016 CONUS extent of pasture/hay was 507,568 km 2 and cultivated crops was 1,313,114 km 2 for a total cropland extent of 1,820,682 km 2 (Table  | Water and wetlands: Water extent varies across time depending on different weather, climate, and land use conditions. Likewise, wetlands also have similar extent fluctuations from these change drivers. According to our results, the total surface water extent in CONUS was 424,962 km 2 in 2001 and 423,670 km 2 in 2016 (Table 
Water and wetland variations can be influenced by many factors such as weather and climate conditions, land use intensity, and other external disturbances. For additional analysis we focused on the correlation between annual precipitation and water or wetland extent in every drainage basin. Precipitation data were obtained from Daymet (https://daymet.ornl.gov/), and total amounts of annual precipitation were calculated in these basins in each mapping epoch. A simple correlation between precipitation and water or wetland extent was calculated for the period of 2001 to 2016. Fig. 
The wetland variations show negative correlations with annual precipitation for most regions. The correlation of annual precipitation in the New England Region was at the p < 0.05 significance level. Annual precipitation correlations in the Ohio, Texas-Gulf, Tennessee, and Great Lakes Regions were at the p < 0.10 significance levels. Similar to the correlation between water extent and precipitation, annual precipitation and wetland correlations in the Souris Red Rainy, Lower Colorado, Lower Mississippi, and Great Basin regions were negative but not significant. The negative correlation between wetland extent and annual precipitation suggests that precipitation can reduce wetland extent due to the increase in water extent along riparian areas. The regions where wetland extent had positive correlations with annual precipitation were the same regions where water extent was negatively correlated with precipitation. One exception was in the Upper Colorado Region where both wetland and water extents were negatively correlated with precipitation. Terrain, water use patterns and precipitation inputs from outside the region likely provided the major drivers of land cover change rather than precipitation inputs within the region.  | Shrub, grass and bare ground: Total shrub extent in CONUS was 1,760,134 km 2 in 2016 and the change rate varies between 0.52% to -0.82% during the mapping period (Fig.  | Developed land: With few exceptions, the U.S. developed footprint continues to expand (Figs. 
Water and wetlands are highly dynamic land cover classes from period to period, heavily influenced by precipitation. Our analysis by major U.S. watershed boundaries further supports this conclusion, finding significant precipitation correlation to change in water and wetland extent over time. Spatially, water change is highest in the more arid western U.S. where the natural episodic influences of precipitation   
and temperature are amplified. However, the change in wetland extent was greatest in the southeast U.S., driven by precipitation and the historical pattern of human caused land cover change influencing natural processes 
The change in cropland footprint (including both classes of pasture/ hay and cultivated crop) was nearly static across the 15 years with only a slight increase of 4778 km 2 . However, there was a substantial decline (7.94%) in pasture/hay during this time, going mostly to cultivated crop. Driving this pasture/hay change was not only the normal crop cycling of agriculture in general, but the more notable permanent conversion of pasture and hay areas in the midwestern and eastern U.S. in part driven by changing climate and economic conditions 
NLCD will continue to monitor the changing U.S. land cover landscape into the future. NLCD is developing new innovations and partnerships to increase monitoring frequency, reduce the turnaround time between satellite imaging and product delivery and expand the variety of products available in an integrated database to allow a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of U.S. land cover change.","2016 MEAN % of 2016CONUS Net Change (, 2001 2004 2006 2008 2011 2013) ||  (, 296 16,296 18,039 18,039 19,419 19,419 20,260 18,252 0.23. 183 929,753 931,326 923,780 937,724 11.61 -39,599 Mixed Forest 293,390 292,688 291,654 290,842 290,813 292,996 293,167 292,221 3.62 -223 Shrub/Scrub 1,755,623 1,764,682 1,758,856 1,766,856 1,752,378 1,756,432 1,760,135 1,759,280 21.77 +3657 Grassland Herbaceous 1,092,991 1,115,338 1,129,833 1,131,729 1,140,488 1,125,422 1,118,412 1,122,030 13. 777 Cultivated Crops 1,264,559 1,268,928 1,275,151 1,281,122 1,290,360 1,299,517 1,313,114 1,284) || A land use and land cover classification system for use with remote sensor data (, , , , 1976) || Human drivers, biophysical changes, and climatic variation affecting contemporary cropping proportions in the northern prairie of the U.S (, , , , , 2018) || Biotic and abiotic effects of human settlements in the wildland-urban interface (, , , 2014) || Integrated climate and land use change scenarios for California rangeland ecosystem services: wildlife habitat, soil carbon, and water supply (, , , , , , , , 2015) || Habitat analysis of North American sand flies near veterans returning from leishmania-endemic war zones (, , , , 2008) || Forest disturbance across the conterminous United States from 1985-2012: the emerging dominance of forest decline (, , , , , , , , 2016) || Linking agricultural crop management and air quality models for regional to national-scale nitrogen assessments (, , , , 2012) || Mapping wildfire evacuation vulnerability in the western US: the limits of infrastructure (, , , , 2013) || Global consequences of land use (, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 2005) || Solutions for a cultivated planet (, , , , , , , , , , , 2011) || Completion of the 2006 national land cover database for the conterminous United States (, , , , , , , , , 2011) || An overview of 21 global and 43 regional land-cover mapping projects (, , , 2015) || A review of large area monitoring of land cover change using Landsat data (, , 2012) || High-resolution global maps of 21st-century forest cover change (, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 2013) || Wetland trends in the southeastern United States (, , 1984) || Completion of the 2001 national land cover database for the conterminous United States (, , , , , , , , , , 2007) || Completion of the 2011 National Land Cover Database for the conterminous United States -representing a decade of land cover change information (, , , , , , , , , , 2015) || U.S. timber production, trade, consumption, and price statistics, 1965-2013.

Survey on Land Use/Land Cover (LU/LC) change analysis in remote sensing and GIS environment: Techniques and Challenges,Sam Navin Mohanrajan; Agilandeeswari Loganathan; Prabukumar Manoharan; Philippe Garrigues,"The surface of the earth is rapidly changing every day due to certain natural reasons and other impacts by society. Over the last few decades, the hottest topics in the field of remote sensing and GIS (geographic information system) environments have evolved from observing the nature of the earth. Owing to the enlargement of several worldwide modifications related to the nature of the earth, land use/land cover (LU/LC) change is considered as the matter of utmost importance in the natural atmosphere, and it has also become an interesting area to be studied by the researchers. As there is a lack of review articles in the land use/land cover change analysis process, we presented a comprehensive review which may help the researchers to proceed further. This paper deals with the most frequent methods used by researchers on various processes like pre-processing, classification, and prediction of time series satellite images for analyzing the LU/LC changes using satellite images. The generic flow of the LU/LC change analysis process and the challenges faced during each process by the researchers are discussed. Varied resolutions of the environmental image captured by remote sensing satellites for analyzing the LU/LC changes are discussed. Various LU/LC classes depending on change in the earth's surface are also studied and the constraint used in each application is stated. The importance of this review lies in the motivation for future researchers to work on the LU/LC change analysis problem effectively.","Introduction: The significance of timely and precise information relating to the nature and scope of land possessions and changes over time is increasing rapidly, particularly in metropolitan areas. Inspecting the Earth from space is crucial for understanding the influence of man's actions on natural resources over different time intervals. The information from the remote sensing satellites in mapping the earth's features and infrastructures has become dynamic. Map-to-map comparisons and imageto-image comparisons are observed in the variations caused by the factors of the LU/LC change process. Land use and land cover are the terms with different degrees of significance in the field of scientific remote sensing. Natural and biological landscapes such as forests, marshlands, grasslands, water lands, and urbanized and built areas denote the land cover area detected from the surface of the earth. The events that take place in the land represent the current use of the properties such as built-up institutions, shopping centers, parks, and reservoirs are described as land use categories 
Remote sensing is also regarded as an essential cause of thematic maps, depicting land cover as it affords a map-like representation of the specific surface of the earth that is spatially constant and extremely reliable, as well as accessible at a range of spatial and temporal measures. Thematic presentation or mapping from remotely detected or sensed images is naturally based on image classification which is attained by computer-aided or visual analysis. The main use of image classification is the labeling of the pixels in the images captured with meaningful information of the real world for enhanced and advantageous information extraction. Thematic maps holding information such as cadastral information, vegetation, and the land cover type could be obtained through the classification of satellite images 
From the broad analysis, we observed many researchers describe the problem of LU/LC change analysis for different regions across the world in the field of remote sensing. Some of the research articles are summarized and explained as follows: Zagros forest preservation plan was made for the protection of forest-covered regions in Iran against destruction. A study of the LU/LC change analysis process for a different time interval between 1992 and 2016 was made by using the Landsat images for the Zagros forest region. Atmospheric and geometric corrections were made for the removal of errors seen in the Landsat images. The supervised maximum likelihood algorithm was used for classifying the images into different classes like the forest, agriculture, rangeland, and builtup areas. Post-processing was done to enhance the image for attaining good classification accuracy. Suitability map was extracted using a Markov chain model. The LCM (Land Change Modeler) using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network helped in calibrating the dependent and the independent variables for predicting the future LU/LC changes in the year 2024 
The spatial and temporal pattern of LU/LC change was observed in the forest-covered area of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (NHAR), China, from 1991 to 2015. Cloud shadows were removed from the Landsat images and the landscape brightness effects on the DEM (digital elevation model) data were reduced using the topographic correction method. The maximum likelihood classification map was used for further post-processing and LU/LC change analysis process 
Changes in the Savannah River Basin for four-time intervals during the period 
The Random Forest, k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and support vector machine (SVM) non-parametric classifiers were in the classification of the Sentinel-2 satellite data for the region of the Red River Delta (RRD), Vietnam. The performance of machine learning methods is compared and analyzed. Google Earth images were used as the training datasets during the process of accuracy assessment. The results revealed that the high overall accuracy by support vector machine followed by Random Forest and k-nearest neighbor (Thanh Noi and Kappas 2018). Many researchers have worked on the LU/ LC change prediction problem for different regions across the world. The hybrid model of cellular automata and Markov chain has been broadly used for LU/LC prediction in the built-up area, forest-covered area, watershed area, mountainous region, and desert region 
Using the hybrid classification methods provides good accuracy during the LU/LC classification process. The unsupervised ISODATA clustering method with the pixel-based supervised maximum likelihood classification method was used for classifying the Landsat imageries for the region of Andassa watershed, Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia. The LU/LC changes were analyzed and calculated from 1985 to 2015. Cellular automata with Markov model is used to predict the LU/ LC condition for the year 2030 and 2045  | Motivation: From the above study, we infer that none of the existing literature reviews on LU/LC presents the complete review on land use/land cover change analysis process. They focused only on a specific stage, i.e., either LU/LC classification  | Objective: The main objective of this paper is listed as follows:
i. The utmost purpose of this review paper is to provide a road map for the researchers who are interested to work on the land use/land cover change analysis to predict the future land cover. ii. This paper presents a comprehensive review of detailed techniques and benefits in various stages of the land use/ land cover change analysis process that starts from the image acquisition stage to the prediction and validation stage. iii. This paper provides a generic flow and the possible framework of the LU/LC change analysis process. iv. The challenges in each stage of LU/LC change analysis have been identified and briefed which might guide future researchers to work effortlessly on the LU/LC change prediction problem.
The observations of many researchers have helped us to model the generic flow of the LU/LC change process, which is shown in Fig.  | Organization of the paper: The rest of the paper provides detailed information and is organized as follows: The ""Satellite image acquisition"" section describes the datasets and their sources. The ""Image processing software types and its key features"" section explains the software tools used for processing an image. The ""Image pre-processing techniques"" section explains the image preprocessing techniques. The ""LU/LC classification methods"" section illustrates a few LU/LC classification methods, the ""Post-classification and LU/LC change analysis"" section describes the use of post-classification and change detection or dependent variables, the ""LU/LC classes and its factors"" section explains the different LU/LC classes and their corresponding factors or independent variables, and the ""LU/LC prediction models"" section informs the few environmental models used for predicting the future LU/LC changes.

The image was collected through aerial photographs, satellite imageries, ancillary data, Google maps, forest department, land resource management, and urban planners. The datasets from different time intervals require careful collection for further processing in remote sensing environment. From various studies, we observed that there were many datasets used by the researchers in the analysis of the LU/LC change. Some of them are shown in Table  | Image processing software types and its key features: In the precise study of remote sensing, we identified the different geospatial software tools used by the researchers for various stages such as pre-processing, classifying, analyzing, and predicting the LU/LC changes using the multispectral satellite images. Some of them are described in Table  | Image pre-processing techniques: The image pre-processing techniques are used for improving the quality and visibility of the satellite images. It is considered as an initial stage where the image enhancement, geometric, radiometric, atmospheric, and topographic corrections are made to improve the quality of the satellite image. Table  | LU/LC classification methods: LU/LC classification is the method of labeling the pixels in the pre-processed satellite image for obtaining the classified images. Every pixel is considered as a unique entity and assigned to a particular class through pixel-based classification. Objectbased classification is the collection of information from a group of related pixels, i.e., it grabs the pixels into graphical shapes, sizes, and other spatial properties. The normally distributed data is assumed under parametric classifiers. The nonparametric classifiers do not consider the classification of statistical parameters or normal assumptions. Fuzzy methodology and spectral mixture analysis are considered as effective methods for sub-pixel-based image classification as they help in sorting out the land cover types in the particular region  | Post-classification and LU/LC change analysis: Post-classification is an improvement process, which improves the quality of the classified LU/LC map through the removal of noise and misclassification errors. This process helps in the enhancement of the overall accuracy by removing the single and scattered pixels present in the LU/LC classified image. Post-classification processing assists in solving the misclassification error that occurs due to substantial spectral confusion between the LU/LC classes, (i.e., confusion between the agricultural land and the barren land). This process holds the advantage of reclassifying the pixels that are misclassified 
The LU/LC classified image will be processed for validating the change analysis for different time intervals over a particular region. LU/LC change analysis is done for the determination of the changes that occurred in some specific areas and for helping in making useful decisions relating to the protection of an environment. The percentage and rate of change are calculated for identifying the magnitude of changes that occurred between different time intervals  | LU/LC classes and its factors: The LU/LC classified classes include areas like built-up area, agricultural land, forest area, vegetation land, water bodies, wasteland, mountain area, and desert area. We collected the LU/LC information of India in the year 2015 to 2016 from Bhuvan-Thematic Services of the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), for getting a good understanding of LU/LC classes. The LU/ LC classified classes in India, for the year 2015 to 2016, are Google Earth provides the multi-temporal time series data and it helps during the process of accuracy assessment.
shown in Fig. 
Based on the development of land transformation in a specific area, the suitability map provides the information needed for the specific LU/LC classes. For instance, forest suitability maps provide information on the different species of trees grown in a specific location of the forest-covered region. The suitability of areas is mapped with the consideration of weighted factors like slope, elevation, and distance from the forest edge, road, water bodies, wasteland, grassland, agricultural land, and settlements 
Table 
Statistical tests were conducted for finding the association between the dependent variable (LU/LC change map) and the independent variables (slope, elevation, and distance from the river, forest edge, barren land, built-up area, and agriculture area). The Cramer's V coefficient test is widely used by the researchers for enabling observation of the association between the dependent and independent variables. The Cramer's V coefficient value always lies between zero (no association between the variables) and one (complete association between the variables). These independent variables are considered as the key factors in analyzing the future LU/LC changes  | LU/LC prediction models: Different environmental models are used by the researchers for forecasting future LU/LC changes. It is necessary for every researcher to work on LU/LC change prediction problem considering the provision of the predicted results to the land resource management and to urban planners to help them in taking suitable actions for protecting the land cover environment. Table 
THE Markov chain (MC) model is used for analyzing the time-based changing landscapes among the LU/LC classes based on the transition probabilities  | Commonly used metrics: We identified the most commonly used metrics for analyzing the satellite images and they are listed as follows: NDVI, NDWI, confusion matrix (used to equate the classified image with the reference image), the kappa coefficient, and overall accuracy. The percentage of change and rate of change is calculated for determining the number of changes experienced between a certain time interval.  | H-p H-p H-p: Environ Sci Pollut Res  | NDVI: The probability of having lower or higher vegetation is identified by the NDVI values 
where NIR represents the Near-Infrared Band and RED represents the Red Band.      | NDWI: The probability of having lower or higher water content is identified by the NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) values 
where NIR represents the Near-Infrared Band and SWIR represents the Short Wave Infrared Band. | Confusion matrix, accuracy assessment, and kappa coefficient: Accuracy assessment is an indispensable and decisive measure in the remotely sensed image classification for detecting the LU/LC change. The reference images are compared with the classified images employing the confusion matrix. Table 
The confidence of the classified images largely depends on accuracy assessment. The analysis of various studies shows the computation of the overall accuracy as the basic need and the kappa coefficient for testing the correctness of the classification process. 
where KS represents kappa statistics; N signifies the matrix r signifies number of rows in the confusion matrix; x ii denotes row i and column i observations; x i+ denotes row i observations; x +i represents column i observations. | Rate percentage of change: For demonstrating the magnitude of the LU/LC change for the different time intervals in a modest way, the rate of change and the percentage of change are calculated.
where POC represents the percentage of change; ROC represents the rate of change; T 1 represents the area (ha) of LU/LC for the time interval 1; T 2 represents the area (ha) of LU/LC for the time interval 2; T i represents the time interval between the T 1 and T 2 in years (yr). | Conceptual framework: The utmost purpose of this review paper is to provide a conceptual framework for the comprehensive land use/ land cover change analysis process and it is shown in Fig.  | Discussions: The natural reasons and the significant changes over the earth's surface for a long time interval have led to the process of LU/LC change analysis. In a remote sensing and GIS environment, several images from different satellites have been deliberated as the important data source where numerous kinds of land cover changes like deforestation, expansion of agricultural land, increase in urban growth, and loss of wetlands over the different time interval is recognized. Steps involved in the analysis of LU/LC change are, acquisition of satellite images, image pre-processing, LU/LC classification, post-classification, accuracy assessment, change analysis, validating dependent and independent variables, and LU/LC change prediction. The different datasets and their sources have been discussed and defined in this paper. The commonly used software programs for processing the different satellite images have also been discussed in this study. Among them, ENVI, ArcGIS, ERDAS Imagine, and IDRISI are frequently used by researchers. Image pre-processing is considered the most important stage, and therefore it should be performed before the LU/LC change analysis process. A few image pre-processing techniques used by researchers help in correcting the atmospheric, radiometric, geometric, and topographic errors in the satellite image. Pre-processing of satellite images should be processed carefully since it is the initial process following data collection. The LU/ LC classification is the strongly focused part in remote sensing environment. Different classification algorithms were used by researchers for classifying the preprocessed satellite image into different classes. We observed that the hybrid classification algorithms provide good accuracy for the pre-processed satellite image. The process of post-classification should be carefully made for removing the misclassification errors in the LU/LC classification map. The Google Earth Engine is the widely used geospatial software for analyzing and obtaining the reference data during the process of accuracy assessment. The classified LU/LC map is analyzed   | 2015): by calculating the area of change that happened for different time intervals. Dependent (LU/LC map) and independent variables (slope, elevation, and distance variables) are the important factors in predicting the LU/LC change. Hence, most of the researchers tend to prefer an effective hybrid prediction method for monitoring and predicting the land cover changes for certain time series in a particular region. Among the performance metrics, the accuracy assessment and kappa statistics were considered as the efficient and required metrics for every LU/LC classification and prediction problem to validate the performance of the results. | Challenges: This paper provides a few research challenges faced during every stage of the LU/LC change analysis process. The challenges are summarized as:
& Acquisition: During the image acquisition process, extracting the region of interest from the study area through datum coordinates from the suitable satellite system is a challenging task for researchers. & Pre-processing: During satellite image pre-processing, geo-referencing the unknown coordinates of   The challenges focused in this paper could be a fertile source for future researchers to do their work actively in LU/ LC remote sensing environment. | Conclusions: This paper evidently presents the generic flow of the LU/LC change analysis process and also provides a detailed discussion on techniques and the challenges faced during each stage of the LU/LC process. The importance of finding the future LU/LC change today employing prediction methods is in the provision of judgments to the land resource management. Moreover, this information will help the government officials, namely, urban planners and forest department, to take necessary actions over the protection of a LU/LC environment. graphic gradients in Hugumburda national forest priority area, Fig. ","Parameter investigation of artificial neural network and support vector machine for image classification (, 2017. 2017) || Modeling of urban growth in tsunami-prone city using logistic regression: analysis of Banda Aceh (, , , , 2015) || Proximate causes of land-use and land-cover change in Bannerghatta National Park: a spatial statistical model (, , , 2017) || Using multivariate adaptive regression spline and artificial neural network to simulate urbanization in Mumbai, India.

Watershed Hydrological Response to Combined Land Use/Land Cover and Climate Change in Highland Ethiopia: Finchaa Catchment,Wakjira Takala Dibaba; Tamene Demissie; Konrad Miegel,"Land use/land cover (LULC) and climate change affect the availability of water resources by altering the magnitude of surface runoff, aquifer recharge, and river flows. The evaluation helps to identify the level of water resources exposure to the changes that could help to plan for potential adaptive capacity. In this research, Cellular Automata (CA)-Markov in IDRISI software was used to predict the future LULC scenarios and the ensemble mean of four regional climate models (RCMs) in the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment (CORDEX)-Africa was used for the future climate scenarios. Distribution mapping was used to bias correct the RCMs outputs, with respect to the observed precipitation and temperature. Then, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used to evaluate the watershed hydrological responses of the catchment under separate, and combined, LULC and climate change. The result shows the ensemble mean of the four RCMs reported precipitation decline and increase in future temperature under both representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The increases in both maximum and minimum temperatures are higher for higher emission scenarios showing that RCP8.5 projection is warmer than RCP4.5. The changes in LULC brings an increase in surface runoff and water yield and a decline in groundwater, while the projected climate change shows a decrease in surface runoff, groundwater and water yield. The combined study of LULC and climate change shows that the effect of the combined scenario is similar to that of climate change only scenario. The overall decline of annual flow is due to the decline in the seasonal flows under combined scenarios. This could bring the reduced availability of water for crop production, which will be a chronic issue of subsistence agriculture. The possibility of surface water and groundwater reduction could also affect the availability of water resources in the catchment and further aggravate water stress in the downstream. The highly rising demands of water, owing to socio-economic progress, population growth and high demand for irrigation water downstream, in addition to the variability temperature and evaporation demands, amplify prolonged water scarcity. Consequently, strong land-use planning and climate-resilient water management policies will be indispensable to manage the risks.","Introduction: Our world is functioning at a mixture of complex systems interacting at a variety of spatial and temporal scales in which both the natural and human factors are thoroughly intertwined. The strong relationship between land use, water and climate from these systems has contributed to prominent concern to the basic planet characteristics and process. The productivity of land, biodiversity, aridity
The LULCC studies in different parts of Ethiopia revealed LULCC processes are intense in the highland parts, driving unprecedented changes at different scales [2, 
Even though the availability of land and water in Africa is highest in the world, some areas of sub-Saharan Africa are seriously threatened through overuse because of the ever-increasing needs of the growing population and inappropriate land management practices 
The fact that the country's relatively abundant water resources have played a minimal role in the Nation's economic development. The Ethiopian government intends to place a priority on water resource development as an essential strategy for economic and social development of the country 
Consequently, studies that consider both the isolated and combined effects of LULCC and climate changes of the specific area are required at regional and local scales as drivers of changes, not limited to global and regional levels, but also local specific. Specifically, this research has been initiated to investigate the watershed hydrological response to the LULCC and climate changes. Integrated approaches of CA-Markov analysis for LULC prediction and ensemble mean of four regional climate models (RCMs) in the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment (CORDEX)-Africa were used for the future climate change scenarios. Then, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological modelling was used for the evaluation of isolated and combined LULCC and climate change impacts. Specifically, this study was aimed at  | Materials and Methods:  | Study Area: The study was conducted in the upper Blue Nile Basin, Finchaa sub-basin in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia.

The catchment is characterized by high topographic relief, with elevation ranging from 851 to 3213 m above sea level.

Water 2020, 12, 1801 6 of 25 | Impact Assessment Framework: The hydrological responses of Finchaa catchment to the impacts of LULCC and climate change were investigated for two future periods of 2021-2050 and 2051-2080. The baseline period consists of the years 1986-2015. Three simulation scenarios were developed for the independent and combined effects of the LULCC and climate change. The first scenario (S1) considers only LULCC, the second scenario (S2) considers only climate change and the third scenario (S3) considers both LULCC and climate change (the combination of the two). Details of the scenarios are depicted in Table 
In the above equation, Po is the proportion of correctly simulated cells; Pc is the expected proportion correction by chance between the observed and simulated map. If Kappa ‚â§ 0.5 shows rare agreement, 0.5 ‚â§ Kappa ‚â§ 0.75 shows a medium level of agreement, 0.75 ‚â§ Kappa ‚â§ 1 shows a high level of agreement and Kappa = 1 for perfect agreement. | Climate Change Scenarios: After evaluating the performance of six Regional Climate Models (RCMs) in Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa, four RCMs showing a better performance were selected. Detail analysis of the CORDEX evaluation is presented in Dibaba et al. 
The RCMs used in this study were: CCLM4-8, HIRHAM5, RACMO22T and RCA4, fed by data of the two representative concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios high emission scenario (RCP8.5) and mid-range mitigation emission (RCP4.5). The years 2021-2050 and 2051-2080 served as future scenario periods and the period from 1986 to 2015 as a historical baseline to evaluate the climate changes. Other weather variables, including solar radiation, relative humidity and wind speed in baseline/historical period were considered in the future scenarios without making any change as the changes in these variables may not have a significant impact in modelling the climate change scenarios on local hydrology  | Bias Correction: The climate model data for hydrological modelling (CMhyd) 
The distribution mapping (DM) uses a transfer function to adjust the cumulative distribution of estimated data to the cumulative distribution of rain gauges  | Hydrological Model: Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a physically-based semi-distributed model that operates on a continues time scale

where, SWt is the final soil water content(mm), SWo is the initial water content (mm), t is the time (days), Rday is the amount of precipitation on day i (mm), Qsurf is the amount of surface runoff on day i (mm), Ea is the amount of evapotranspiration on day i (mm), Wseep is the amount of water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile on day i (mm) and Qgw is the amount of return flow on day i (mm).
In the SWAT model, the simulation of the hydrological process begins with watershed delineation and generating streamflow networks. With a 30 m resolution DEM, Finchaa watershed is delineated into 25 sub-basins and a multiple HRU was defined with classes of 10% land use, 20% soil and 10% slope. Accordingly, 231 HRUs were created. Then, with the input of weather data from five stations (Fincha, Hareto, Kombolcha, Nashe and Shambu), the SWAT model setup was ready for the first simulation, which was used for model evaluation. Shambu station, consisting of all the climate variables, was considered a weather generator.
Before using the output of the SWAT simulation for analysis, the performance of the model was evaluated for the catchment. Although distributed hydrological models can relate spatial changes of LULCC to the hydrological process simulation, it is difficult to transform many calibrated parameters into time-variant conditions of the future, especially if empirical parameters are used  | Sensitivity Analysis, Calibration and Validation: Owing to a large number of flow parameters in SWAT, identifying the most sensitive parameters is necessary to improve the calibration of the hydrological model. Through the sensitivity analysis, the most sensitive parameters that strongly influence the flow process will be identified. The Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2) embedded in the SWAT-CUP (Calibration and Uncertainty Program) was used to achieve the sensitivity analysis, calibration and validation 
Calibration of the hydrological model is the process of estimating model parameters by comparing the model prediction with the observed data for the same condition 
The fitness of the model simulation with the observed streamflow was expressed by statistics like coefficients of determination (R 2 ), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), percent bias (PBIAS) and the ratio of the root-mean-square error to the standard deviation of measured data (RSR). The model performance ratings were based on the statistics recommended by Moriasi et al. 
Water 2020, 12, 1801
In the above equations, Qm is the measured discharge, Qs is the simulated discharge, Qm is the average measured discharge, and Qs is the average simulated discharge.
The propagation of uncertainties in model outputs in SUFI-2, expressed as the 95% probability distribution, calculated by the 2.5% and 97.5% levels of the cumulative distributions of output variables, is considered as 95PPU  | Results and Discussion:  | CA-Markov Model Performance and Land Use/Land Cover Change Projections: The observed LULC1987 and LULC2002 were used to facilitate the simulation of LULC2017 using CA-Markov model. Then, the observed LULC2017 were cross-compared with the simulated LULC2017 to evaluate the performance of the model using the kappa index. Accordingly, the calculated Kappa index is calculated as 0.87. The result reveals a high level of agreement between the simulated and observed LULC2017, showing the CA-Markov model is strong to simulate the future LULC in the study area.
The LULC classes of Finchaa catchment were grouped into eight classes: agriculture, commercial farm, forestland, grazing land, rangeland, urban and built up, swampy and water bodies. From the land use maps of 2002 and 2017, Finchaa catchment was characterized by expansion of intensive agriculture and urbanization resulting in a natural vegetation decline. Commercial farm, urban and built-up and agricultural lands have increased as shown by Table 
The SWAT model requires the LULC classes to be reclassified in the code that the model recognizes. Accordingly, the LULC classes are defined with their equivalent representative, as shown in Figure  | Hydrological Model Performance:  | Sensitivity Analysis, Calibration and Validation: Sensitivity analysis for the simulated streamflow was performed using a daily observed flow to identify the most sensitive parameter with strong influence on model outputs. Initially, parameters related to surface runoff, groundwater, geomorphology, evaporation and soil water were considered and 11 parameters were identified as the most sensitive parameters for calibration. The given ranks are shown in Table  | Hydrological Model Performance:  | Sensitivity Analysis, Calibration and Validation: Sensitivity analysis for the simulated streamflow was performed using a daily observed flow to identify the most sensitive parameter with strong influence on model outputs. Initially, parameters related to surface runoff, groundwater, geomorphology, evaporation and soil water were considered and 11 parameters were identified as the most sensitive parameters for calibration. The given ranks are shown in Table 
The calibration results on mean monthly flow show that SWAT model is able to capture the observed streamflow with R 2 , NSE, PBIAS and RSR of 0.71, 0.71, -1.1, and 0.54 respectively. The average monthly flow validation indicates R 2 , NSE, PBIAS and RSR of 0.81, 0.76, 14.3 and 0.49 respectively. This indicates that the performance of the SWAT model in the validation is good enough to simulate the stream flow in the Finchaa catchment. Furthermore, p-factor and R-factor statistics showed good agreement with 0.86 and 0.77 during calibration and 0.73, and 0.7 during validation, respectively. Overall, the statistics for goodness fit shows good agreement between the observed and simulated average monthly flow. However, the model is not able to simulate all peak flows well, as shown in Figure  | Climate Change Projections of the RCMs: To illustrate how each RCMs predicted precipitation and temperature, the projection of individual RCMs and ensemble mean of the RCMs were analyzed. The bias-corrected precipitation, and temperature within distribution mapping for future scenarios, are compared to the baseline data sets . Further, the hydrological responses of the catchment are analyzed by quantifying and comparing the future water balance components (surface runoff, groundwater flow, total water yield and evapotranspiration).   | Climate Change Projections of the RCMs: To illustrate how each RCMs predicted precipitation and temperature, the projection of individual RCMs and ensemble mean of the RCMs were analyzed.

Further, the hydrological responses of the catchment are analyzed by quantifying and comparing the future water balance components (surface runoff, groundwater flow, total water yield and evapotranspiration). | Rainfall: The individual and ensemble mean of the four RCMs were used to assess climate change in two future scenarios; near future (2021-2050) and mid future (2051-2080) with respect to the baseline period (1986-2015) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The results of the projected precipitation by the individual RCMs show a different degree of precipitation changes. Except for HIRHAM5 in mid-term, all the RCMs show precipitation decline under both scenarios. According to CCLM4-8, precipitation decreases by -12.67% under RCP4.5 in near future and -27.47% under RCP8.5 scenarios in a midterm. The highest decline of the precipitation was simulated under RCP8.5 in a mid-term with CCLM4-8 and the lowest decline by HIRHAM5 under RCP4.5 in a midterm. HIRHAM5 shows that precipitation will increase under RCP8.5 scenarios. Summary of RCMs precipitation projections was presented in Table 
Changes in projected precipitation are more profound on seasonal bases compared to the annual bases in the catchment. The projected precipitation shows a declining trend in all seasons, except in April by RCP8.5, for both future time horizons and August by RCP4.5 in a near-future scenario. However, the changes are projected higher in the dry season than a wet season as shown by Figure 
precipitation decreases by -12.67% under RCP4.5 in near future and -27.47% under RCP8.5 scenarios in a midterm. The highest decline of the precipitation was simulated under RCP8.5 in a mid-term with CCLM4-8 and the lowest decline by HIRHAM5 under RCP4.5 in a midterm.

The results of precipitation projections in this study are consistent with the results presented by climate change studies  | Temperature: The variation of projected future maximum and minimum temperature is presented in Table 
The changes in projected temperature were not only expected to vary annually, but they also vary in all seasons. However, the seasonal variations are higher for the minimum temperature than the maximum temperature, as shown in Figure 
Like the annual changes, the highest seasonal rise in temperature is expected by the high emission scenario than the medium emission scenario. Likewise, the highest rise in maximum and minimum temperature is expected in the midterm scenario (2051-2080) than the near future (2021-2050).

The hydrological responses of the watershed were considered in terms of the process contributs to the annual surface runoff, annual groundwater, total water yield and potential evapotranspiration as shown in Table 
The highest increase in surface flow and decline of groundwater recharge is associated with the highest expansion of agricultural lands and urban expansion and decline of forest and shrubland. This reveals a massive conversion of LULC to intensive agriculture and settlements will reduce the soil infiltrations capacity, causing a large portion of rainfall directly changed to surface runoff. The reduction of soil water infiltration, in turn, causes groundwater flow decline. Furthermore, the increasing demand for the growing population to use groundwater could additionally contribute to the decline of groundwater by increasing groundwater withdrawal. The recent evidence by 
The increase in surface water has increased the total water yield of the catchment. This indicates that degraded watersheds can accelerate surface runoff by reducing both the retention as soil water and groundwater recharge. Consequently, the catchment will face severe soil erosion, landslides and flash floods. This could become a great concern where mega hydropower projects exist. Overall, surface runoff, water yield and potential evapotranspiration were found to be more sensitive than the groundwater flow in Finchaa catchment under LULCC.
The findings of the study are consistent with various research studies conducted in other catchments. For instance, Gashaw et al.

For instance, Gashaw et al.  | Impacts of Climate Change: Changes in rainfall and temperature were used to predict the impacts of climate change on water balance components of the catchment. Consequently, the projected changes in mean annual precipitation and temperature, under the two RCPs, caused a significant variation in the projected water balance components of Finchaa catchment.
SWAT simulations for the near future and mid future showed that the decline of precipitation and increase temperature will lead to reduced surface flow, groundwater and overall water yield (Table 
vulnerability of land to soil erosion, which reduced the water resources of the catchment. | Impacts of Climate Change: Changes in rainfall and temperature were used to predict the impacts of climate change on water balance components of the catchment.

The spatial distribution of the hydrological process under the projected climate change for RCP4.5 and RCP 8.5 is presented in Figure 
The increase in PET due to high-temperature increase coupled with decreasing precipitation could also lead to reduced soil moisture, which is required for plant growth and groundwater storage. This could imply the reduced availability of water for crop production, which will become chronic to the farmers in the catchment whose livelihood is based on agriculture alone. Further, an increase in temperature led to increased PET, this in turn, resulted in an increased need for irrigation.
Climate change studies on Africa, sub-Sahara, in particular, confirmed similar findings as climate projections show a range of warming trends in inland subtropics, a frequent occurrence of Generally, the decrease in average annual flow over the catchment could be due to the annual and seasonal decrease of precipitation and increase in temperature under both scenarios. The possibility of surface water, groundwater and total water yield reduction in the catchment could affect the availability of water resources in the catchment and further aggravate water stress in the downstream. The acceleration of the increasing water abstractions could also contribute to the further decline in water resources besides the climate change pressure.

Climate change studies on Africa, sub-Sahara, in particular, confirmed similar findings as climate projections show a range of warming trends in inland subtropics, a frequent occurrence of extreme heat events, increasing aridity and changes in rainfall 
The finding also confirms the findings of Beyene et al. 
The study by Shiferaw et al.  | Impacts of Land Use/Land Cover and Climate Change: Although the direct effect of a decline in precipitation and increased temperature disturbs the hydrology of the catchment as presented under the impacts of climate change, changes in LULC with soil and vegetation properties, either enhance or decrease the impacts of climate change. In this regard, the effects of combined LULC and climate change on the hydrological process was done to distinguish the effects of LULC and climate change under the isolated and combined scenarios.
The increase of temperature and decreasing precipitation under a varying LULC in Finchaa catchment shows a decline of surface runoff, groundwater and total water yield, whereas the projected evapotranspiration is increasing. The combined effects of LULC and climate change on the watershed hydrological process are presented in Table 
the impacts due to climate change add significant impact on the existing undernutrition, infectious disease, the vulnerability of rain-fed agriculture and flash flooding crises in the region.
The finding also confirms the findings of Beyene et al.  | Impacts of Land Use/Land Cover and Climate Change: Although the direct effect of a decline in precipitation and increased temperature disturbs the hydrology of the catchment as presented under the impacts of climate change, changes in LULC with soil and vegetation properties, either enhance or decrease the impacts of climate change.

The increase of temperature and decreasing precipitation under a varying LULC in Finchaa catchment shows a decline of surface runoff, groundwater and total water yield, whereas the projected evapotranspiration is increasing. The combined effects of LULC and climate change on the watershed hydrological process are presented in Table 
the upstream and outlet of the catchment, with the highest under RCP8.5 in the late scenario. Water yield is projected to decline higher around the upstream while a high increase in PET is projected around the downstream of the catchment. The increasing temperature is the most dominant factor affecting surface runoff in climate change scenarios while increasing urbanization is the main contributor affecting the surface runoff in LULC scenarios. Overall, the increase in surface runoff and total water yield due to LULCC was offset by the decline of the surface runoff and total water yield, due to climate change impacts. Consequently, the effect of climate change is decisive compared to the LULCC in the Finchaa catchment. The high sensitivity of water balance components and streamflow to the climate change is also reported by other studies in different parts of the world 
In summary, the seasonal and annual variation of the future temperature shows the increased hot and dry years that will lead to serious water scarcity. Consequently, the increase in warming and evaporation in the catchment highly affects the three reservoirs in the catchment increasing water stress. The recent study by Coffel et al.

Although the study did not cover the quantification of sediment yield, the SWAT simulation, under the LULCC, shows that the sediment yield increases with the changes. However, sediment yield is decreasing with the projected scenarios of climate change. The study by Gadissa et al.  | Conclusions: Four RCMs and their ensemble mean, under CORDEX-Africa, were applied for the climate change study. The simulations of all RCMs, except HIRHAM5, show decreasing precipitation under both high and medium-low emission scenarios. With respect to temperature, all RCMs projections show an increasing temperature with varying degree of changes. To avoid the considerable variations of the individual RCMs in projecting precipitation and temperature, the ensemble mean of the RCMs were used for the hydrological impact studies of climate changes, and the combined LULC and climate change. Although uncertainties of climate prediction still exist, the use of the ensemble RCMs was found to be a suited strategy to evaluate the uncertainties of individual RCMs.
The findings from this work were applied to distinguish the effects of LULC and climate change on the water balance components of the Finchaa catchment. Consequently, the metro-hydrological process could change in probability and intensity due to climate change, but also due to local land use/land cover change. If climate change is considered alone, the increase in temperature and decrease of predicted precipitation will decrease the surface runoff, groundwater and total water yield, whereas potential evapotranspiration and evaporation increase. However, the surface runoff increases under land use/land cover changes, due to the highly expanding urbanization and intensive agriculture. Overall, the sensitivity of water resources for land use/land cover and climate change over Finchaa catchment shows the effect of land use/land cover change is stunned by the effects of climate change. Consequently, climate change is found to be predominant over the effects of LULCC.
Further, the seasonal and annual variation of the future precipitation and temperature in the catchment shows the increasingly hot and dry years that will lead to serious water scarcity. Consequently, the catchment is highly vulnerable to climate change and its impacts could range from warming to crop failures as a result of prolonged dry seasons. The Upper Blue Nile basin will face regional water scarcity regardless of whether the precipitation is increased, constant or decreased 
The study analysis suggests that the impact assessments of the combined land use/land cover and climate change in the Finchaa catchments are well-represented by the SWAT simulations. However, the limited availability and quality of hydro-climatic data in the region need urgent attention to improve our understanding of the change in existing and future climate and LULCCs.
The findings of this study provided important information on the relative influences of how the watershed hydrological process in Finchaa catchment respond to the changes in land use/land cover and climate change. This could help to plan proper water resources management interventions. If the degraded sloppy lands are rehabilitated, the ground recharge increase and the surface runoff, which washes the topsoil into the lakes, is reduced. Furthermore, the three lakes in the catchment should be buffered with proper management strategies. In general, the result highlights the need for regional developments and cooperation to urge strong climate-resilient management strategies and to counteract the rapid climate changes in the catchment.","Interactions between climate change land use change on biodiversity: Attribution problems, risks, and opportunities (, , 2014) || Drivers and implications of land use/land cover dynamics in finchaa catchment (, , , 2020) || Estimating the impacts of land-cover change on runoff using the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT): Case study of Nzoia catchment, Kenya/Estimation des impacts du changement d'occupation du sol sur l'√©coulement √† l'aide de SWAT: √âtude du cas du bassin (, , , 2009) || Land use change trends and their driving forces in the kilombero valley floodplain, Southeastern Tanzania.

A review on change detection method and accuracy assessment for land use land cover,Ali Chughtai; Habibullah Abbasi; Ismail Karas,"The assessment of land use land cover change is extremely important for understanding the relationship between humans and nature. The enormous changes at a regional scale and advancements in technology have encouraged researchers to gather more information. The remote sensing technology and GIS tools cooperatively have made it easier to monitor the changes in land use land cover (LULC) from past to present. This technology has unraveled the changes at the regional and global level and has also contributed tremendous benefits to the scientific community. A variety of change detection algorithms have been used in the history of remote sensing to detect changes at earth's surface and newer techniques are still in process. The data from remote sensing satellites are the primary sources that provide an opportunity to acquire information about LULC change in recent decades, which extensively use different algorithms according to the research needs. The selection of appropriate change detection method is highly recommended in every remote sensing project. This review paper begins with the traditional pre and post-classification change detection techniques related to LULC information at the regional level. Therefore, this paper evaluated the mostly used change detection method among all others to find remarkable results. Thus the review concludes the post-classification change detection method using maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) supervised classification is applicable in all cases. The comparative analysis was also performed in a selected region having multiple land features during review in which MLC results best in comparison to others. MLC is the most commonly used technique from the past till present that has achieved high accuracy in all regions comparatively to other techniques.","Introduction: In the course of the past three decades, remote sensing technology along with the use of GIS has provoked the importance of LULC change assessment due to more rapid and extensive changes made on earth's surface 
The main purpose of this paper is to review and focus the type of earth's surface regions in the context of LULC classes to define the suitable change detection method for extracting better LULC change information whether by implementing pre-classification change detection technique or post-classification comparison technique of individually classified multi-temporal multispectral medium resolution remotely sensed satellite data because it is freely and easily available such as Landsat mission in comparison of high-resolution satellite data such as SPOT, IKONOS, QUICK BIRD, etc., which is much more costly for academic and individual researchers. Due to the importance of monitoring change in earth's surface features, there is a gigantic need for scientific research for the evaluation of change detection techniques which is currently an active topic and new techniques are continuously developing. | A review of change detection techniques: In order to the selection of appropriate change detection methods, this review research has focused the evaluation of LULC features of different landscape regions to describe which change detection method is better to execute. Therefore in this section a diversity of change detection methods has been reviewed according to earth's land surface and has been categorized into eight different regions which are: 1) Vegetation, 2) Urbanization, 3) Delta Region, 4) Mountainous Region, 5) River Flow, 6) Coastal Zone, 7) Desertification, and 8) Watershed.
Most of the studies were trying to answer the reasons of what drives the changes in LULC of the region  | Vegetation: A variety of change detection methods has been reviewed in this category. This category includes forest areas, agricultural areas, and large-scale plantation schemes such as orchards.  | Urbanization: This category is based on the researches made upon cities and urban sprawl.
(K Ridd and Liu, 1998) compared four change detection algorithms in an urban environment of Salt Lake City metropolitan of Utah, United States. Image differencing, image regression, TCT, and CHI-square transformation were used to identify the best change detection method. The study was categorized into 7 categories which are: (1) Construction site to new residential (2) new residential to vegetated residential (3) Farmland to construction site (4) Farmland to industrial/commercial (5) Dry farm to green farm (6) Green farm to dry farm (7) Soil/Gravel tonal change. Among these 7 categories, this study concluded that none of the above mention algorithms has defined change in all 7 categories  | Delta region: The review of estuaries and delta regions has been discussed in this section.
(X.  | Mountainous region: The research study conducted on high and low steep mountainous and hilly region is reviewed here. 
Supervised classification MLC was used before the post-classification change detection technique to identify the type of land and the changes that occurred during the study period. The results showed a positive change in vegetation due to afforestation in the region and increasing trend in built-up, while a decrease in barren land and agriculture  | River flow: The researches made on rivers and flood affected areas has been reviewed in this category.
(Sharma et al., 2011) assessed pre and post-flooding LULC change of three districts of Gujrat state, India. Three different classification approaches iso-data, MLC, and fuzzy rule base were applied to extract LULC information. The post-classification change detection method was used to detect ""from-to"" quantitative change analysis during the study period. The Kappa statistics values of all three classifications were computed and compared. The comparison of kappa values showed that un-supervised classification ISO-DATA achieved 0.78, supervised classification MLC achieved 0.84, and the Fuzzy rule base classification achieved 0.87 because fuzzy rule classification gave better separation of LULC classes  | Coastal zone: The LULC assessment of coastline and seashore areas and its surroundings falls under this category.  | Desertification: The drought and dry land areas falls under this category are reviewed.  | Watershed: The researches on watershed are reviewed in this category.  | Analysis of literature review: In the previous section, eight different regions were reviewed along with a variety of change detection techniques applied. This section will evaluate the most commonly used change detection method applied to many of the research studies in the past two decades until the present. The post-classification change detection using MLC supervised classification has been implemented the most and proposed by (H. 
Few studies had also applied pre-classification change detection technique for a single land feature to detect the changes and extract useful information, for example, NDVI was implemented by 
The comparative analysis of change detection methods is adapted to justify the best method through thematic accuracy assessment results as  
Remotely sensed data always vary in spatial, radiometric, spectral, temporal resolutions and different types of sensors which may result errors in image classification, so the selection of appropriate change detection methods is very much necessary, as concluded in this literature that for a classified remotely sensed data whether supervised or unsupervised post-classification comparison technique is the best for change detection of a landscape with multiple LULC classes while a landscape with complex LULC features which cannot be easily evaluated using traditional pixel by pixel classification techniques require some advance classification techniques such as sub-pixel classification, decision rule-based classification and fuzzy classification for precise evaluation of LULC features. The extraction of single land feature to assess change and no change or rate of change using remotely sensed data depends upon the landscape features such as humidity, soil moisture, sun angle and spatial resolution which justify the selection of appropriate change detection method. | Selection of appropriate change detection method: In the field of remote sensing, analysis of the raster image for the selection of appropriate change detection method is important to extract useful LULC change information. The satellite image raw data may vary due to geometric and radiometric flaws because of the curved shape of    getting the best results (Figs. 
From the classification results, it is seen in Table  | Thematic accuracy assessment: Accuracy assessment methods are used to validate the LULC map classification processes which decide the quality of gathered information justifying that the image pixels are well classified or misclassified from remotely sensed data. These accuracy assessments can result qualitatively which is usually a comparison between classified LULC map and on ground situation or quantitatively to identify and quantify by comparing classified map data with reference data, which is very much important for developing results assessment and decision-making. A variety of accuracy assessment methods has been discussed in the previous remote sensing literature 
Error matrix not only calculates the user, producer and overall accuracy but also allows calculating the kappa statistics which is generated to evaluate the percentage of well classification has been performed. Kappa coefficient of agreement justifies the classification performed perfect agreement or just equal to random or no agreement. User, producer and overall accuracy assessment is basically a chance result in certain accuracy and to get rid of the influence of chance; kappa estimation can be done by calculating coefficient of agreement and mathematically represented as   | Table 4: Assessment of overall accuracy. | K% = 63%: Accuracy assessment of LULC change detection of remotely sensed data plays an important role in remote sensing and for the further information interested candidate should look at these two books  | Conclusion & recommendation: The multi-temporal satellite images of the same sensor are prerequisites for determining the change and selection of appropriate change detection algorithms to achieve good change results. The analysis for the selection of appropriate change detection is a dynamic research topic and newer techniques are still being developed. This paper has a detailed review of change detection methods applied on different study areas but none of the single change detection methods is applicable at all cases (A. 
Above all, it is very clear from the above pie diagram that there were numerous change detection methods used in the past two decades among those post-classification using MLC is widely used. In practice, several change detection techniques are often used to implement change detection, whose results are then compared to identify the best product through visual assessment or quantitative accurate assessment. The selection of a suitable change detection method requires careful consideration which has been discussed in section 4. The major finding of the present study is that all methods are not hundred percent accurate, but post-classification yields useful information and should be viewed as complementary in comparison to the others. Therefore it is suggested to research scholars, the scientific community, and resource managers to apply the mentioned approach for change method to get the remarkable results that will be helpful in high thematic accuracy and acceptable outcomes to prevent further losses.

The estimated global economic damage associated with floods since the end of the 20th century was 386 billion USD 
Frequent flooding occurs in Bangladesh as a result of severe overflow from three major rivers: the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers (GBM), and heavy rainfall from upstream and inland locations 
Anthropogenic climate change is expected to increase the occurrence of flooding in Bangladesh 
Even though flooding cannot be fully controlled, its damage to people and property can be mitigated by identifying flood susceptible areas and influencing factors. In Bangladesh, many attempts have been made to map flood vulnerability and susceptible areas across the country; however, basin-scale risk assessment is still underdeveloped. The accurate identification of floodprone areas in specific catchments may help susceptible communities and decision-makers to mitigate the damage caused by floods in the future, thereby alleviating flood risk 
Flooding is a dynamic process resulting from the complex interaction of watershed manageme nt and hydro-meteorological, hydrogeological, and geomorphological conditions. It is a complex and non-linear process that may never be effectively controlled through simple linear processes 
Geospatial techniques are widely used in flood susceptibility modeling (FSM) 
Ensemble modeling is the process of integrating a standalone model into a combined model to improve the prediction accuracy  | Materials and methods:  | Study area: The Surma River basin of northeast Bangladesh located at 25¬∞10'N and 91¬∞30'E (Fig. 
Detailed information on specific aspects of the workflow is outlined below (Fig.  | Land cover analysis: In this study, the CART algorithm was used in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) (https://code.earthengine.google.com/) to develop multi-temporal land cover maps of the study area between 2000 and 2017. CART is a non-parametric algorithm, capable of detecting inputparameter relationships and splitting them into nodes based on spectral similarity. Further information on the CART algorithm is presented in section 2.5.5. The GEE aids in the storage of satellite images and the performance of complex calculations in the cloud. Calibrated top-ofatmosphere (TOA) reflectance products from Landsat 7 
Training datasets were used to generate land cover maps, and the remaining 30% of the data was used to examine accuracy and classification performance.
Following 
The single land cover dynamic index (SLCDI) and bilateral land cover dynamic index (BLCDI) are often used to quantify changes in the intensity of land cover conversion. These indices can be used to identify internal variations and transitions of LC by calculating the loss and gain of each LC category over a time period. In addition, the variation of LC intensity was also determined for each study period using the integrated bilateral land cover dynamic index (IBLCDI). SLCDI, BLCDI and IBLCDI can be defined as follows 
In Eqs.
(1) to (3), LAS and LAE are areas of land cover type at the beginning and end of the study period, respectively; T is the monitoring period; ùêøùê¥ ùëÜ,ùê∏ is the area converted from Sth to Eth type, denotes loss; and ùêøùê¥ ùê∏,ùëÜ is the area converted from Eth to Sth type and denotes gain. | Population growth: Population data for 2000, 2014, and 2017 were obtained from the LandScan dataset (https://landscan.ornl.gov/landscan-datasets). Further, to calculate the PG, we divided the population by grid size (30 m √ó 30 m) using resampling tools. Finally, the PG in each pixel is calculated using the following equation:
where PS and PE are the population per pixel at the start and end times in the study period, respectively, and T is the monitoring period. | Road density: Road data of the study area were obtained from the Local Government Engineering Department
(LGED) at a scale of 1:800,000. It is worth noting that national highways, regional highways, and district roads were considered. RD values were calculated using the kernel density function. | Flood susceptibility modeling 2.5.1 Preparation of flood inventory map: The mapping of the flood extent aids in determining of its relationship with influencing factors. In this study, three flood inventory maps for 2000, 2014, and 2017 were prepared using Landsat 7
(ETM+), Landsat 8, and Sentinel-1 satellite images, respectively, and 1500 (500 for each year) flood points were considered. Landsat 7 and 8 images were obtained from the Earth Explorer (https://www.earthexplorer.usgs.gov) and processed in ArcGIS (v. 10.5) to develop flood inventories for 2000 and 2014. The 2017 flood inventory was prepared using JavaScript API in the GEE platform (https://code.earthengine.google.com) considering Sentinel-1 SAR: C-band (Synthetic Aperture Radar). To delineate flooded areas, satellite images consisting of pre-and post-flood periods were considered for each flooded year. Water and non-water pixels were combined to obtain the maximum waterbodies. The waterbodies that appeared in both images (preand post-floods) were considered permanent waterbodies (rivers, wetlands, ponds, etc.), and nonwater pixels were deemed non-flooded areas. Hence, the areas depicting waterbodies in both images but non-waterbodies in the pre-flood image were considered to be flooded areas 
training and testing  | Identifying factors that influence floods: To determine flood-susceptible locations, a number of factors influencing the susceptibility of an area were studied. As the influencing factors may vary 
The factors derived from DEM, that is, elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, drainage density, etc., have a different spatial resolutions (30 m). At the same time, geology, soil texture, and proximity to roads were digitized at a scale of 1:100,000 and 1:800,000. Owing to these different spatial resolutions, it was challenging to avoid uncertainties. All factor maps were resampled to a 30 m √ó 30 m grid, assuming that the same grid size would be useful. This is also a common practice in geospatial data  | Feature selection and multicollinearity analysis: Information gain ratio (IGR) is a technique that can be used for feature selection. It is one of the most common methods for evaluating significant factors affecting flooding, and improving the predictive efficiency and performance of the models  | Bayesian regularization back propagation neural network: A BRBP neural network is a multi-layer neural network that typically consists of three layers:
input layers (ILs), one or more hidden layers (HLs), and an output layer (OL). This MLA is computationally intensive but can result in a strong generalization of complex, limited, or noisy datasets. In this study, the ""trainbr"" algorithm with the command ""nftool"" in MATLAB (v.
R2017a) was used to implement the BRBP neural network for FSM  | Classification and regression trees: CART is a non-parametric method proposed by  | Evidence belief function: EBF is a statistical model based on the Dempster-Shafer theory which identifies spatial integratio n based on a combination law 
(i) belief function (Bel), disbelief function (DisBel), (iii) uncertainty (Unc), and (iv) plausibility (Pls). The values of these four functions varied from zero to one (Supplementary Data, Fig.  | Ensemble modeling: A few weaknesses have been observed in the aforementioned individual models, as they usually do not yield desirable outcomes; hence, many researchers recommend the use of ensemble models to overcome specific model limitations 
where EM indicates the ensemble model, and ùê¥ùëàùê∂ùëÖùëÇùê∂ ùëñ ùëÜùë¢ represents the AUCROC value for the success rate of the standalone model (SMi;  | Validation and performance of the models: In this study, the area under the curve-receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) was plotted to validate flood susceptibility maps for both standalone and ensemble models. In the AUC-ROC, the ""X"" axis indicates the false positive (FP) rate or 1-specificity, while the ""Y"" axis indicates the true positive (TP) rate or sensitivity 
The AUC-ROC was separately calculated for training (success rate) and testing (prediction rate) datasets, and testing datasets were not used to develop the model.
Furthermore, the performance of predictive models (standalone and ensemble models) was graphically analyzed using a Taylor diagram 
In the Taylor diagram, statistical indices such as correlation coefficients and standard deviation (SD) were derived to compare model outputs and actual results. | Flood susceptibility mapping: Flood susceptibility maps of the study area were developed for three time periods 
Finally, flood susceptibility was categorized into four classes: low, moderate, high, and very high susceptibility using the natural breaks classification method  | Relative changes in flooding areas: To analyze the correlations between flood susceptible areas with land cover, population, and RD, the relative changes in flooding (RCF) areas were calculated for the same period with a grid size of 30 m √ó 30 m. The RCF can be derived using the following equation 
where ùêπùëÜ ùë† indicates flood susceptibility in the initial year, ùêπùëÜ ùê∏ denotes the ending year; and T is the monitoring period. | Geo-statistical analysis for spatial correlation 2.6.1 Moran's I index: The spatial correlation (Moran's I) was calculated from the residuals obtained from geographica lly weighted regression (GWR) model 
That is, it determines the similarity of features. Positive Moran's I denotes clustering, while a negative value represents dispersion  | Multiple linear regression analysis: Multiple linear regression (MLR) was performed to examine the relationship between differe nt LCC scenarios and the relative changes in flood areas. Twelve scenarios (Sc.)-Sc. 1: agricultura l land to built-up area, Sc. 2: agricultural land to forest, Sc. 3: agricultural land to waterbodies, Sc.

Additional details can be sourced from studies conducted by  | Results:  | Land cover classification and accuracy assessment: The classified land cover maps of the study area are shown in Fig. 
Confusion matrix and kappa coefficients were calculated to determine the accuracy of satellite-derived land-cover classification. The results revealed that the overall accuracy levels of the land cover for 2000, 2014, and 2017 were 89.57%, 97.75%, and 92.36%, respectively (Table  | Land cover change: The Markov transfer matrix was applied to detect land-cover transitions at different times (e.g., 
However, the water area increased from 2014 to 2017. The forest area expanded from 2000 to 2014 and from 2000 to 2017, while it decreased from 2014 to 2017 (Fig. 
Furthermore, the comparative LCC rate for forests from 2000 to 2017 was 163%, demonstrating a substantial increase in this category. Built-up areas changed from 2.62% in 2000 to 4.97% in 2017 at a comparative rate of 89.62% (Supplementary Data, Tables  | Dynamic index for land cover changes: Throughout the short-and long-term transition periods, BLCDI for the built-up area was significantly higher; the newly developed built-up area was mostly transformed from agricultura l land and waterbodies. This occurred as a result of the expansion of urban areas and constructio n of various types of infrastructure. More specifically, the increase in population resulted in a higher demand for housing and industrial growth, and consequently, the built-up area increased at the expense of agricultural land and waterbodies. The results of IBLCDI showed that the overall longterm dynamic transition intensity was 13.32%  | Feature selection and multi-collinearity test of flood influencing factors: The results of the IGR for three different periods among 13 influencing factors, elevation, slope, NDVI, aspect, mean monsoon rainfall, land cover, plan curvature, soil texture, drainage density, proximity to rivers, proximity to roads, and population density, are shown in Fig. 
The results of the Pearson's correlation indicated that the values did not exceed 0.70, which confirmed that the factors were free from multicollinearity (Fig.  | Construction of flood susceptibility maps: In Furthermore, the ensemble model (BRBP-CART-EBF) was used to generate the flood susceptibility map for the three time periods  | Validation and model performance: The accuracies of the standalone and ensemble models were evaluated by plotting the (AUC-ROC). The model's training datasets (60%) were used to plot the success rate curve (SRC), but were unable to evaluate the model's predictive capability. Hence, the prediction rate curve (PRC) was used to determine the accuracy of flood prediction. The SRCs and PRCs for the 2017 flood are shown in Fig. 
Furthermore, the aggregated accuracy of the models was checked using the Taylor diagram and the results showed that EM4 outperformed other standalone and ensemble models (Fig.  | Relationships between flooding with land cover change, population growth, and road density:  | Spatial pattern assessment: The results of the Moran's I index, derived from spatial correlation are presented in Table 
Hence, relative changes in flood areas can be inferred to have been associated with LCC, increase in population, and growth of road networks. | Multiple linear regression: The MLR results as a part of the correlation analysis between the RCF areas and different scenarios of LCC are presented in Table  | Assessment of semi-variogram and rose diagrams: Semi-variogram plots were generated for four scenarios of LCC with RCF areas because these scenarios provided useful information regarding the relationship between flood and LCC (Supplementary Data, Table  | Population growth and road density: An increased population within an area translates to increased anthropogenic activities, which enhances the likelihood of flood occurrence. A positive correlation between an increase in population and flooding was observed in this study. Specifically, people living downstream and adjacent to the river network were exposed to a relatively greater risk of flooding. Table 
Furthermore, the assessment of RD is an important factor in the occurrence of floods suggesting that the distribution of roads was directly related to flooding (Table  | Discussion: Flooding is a natural phenomenon that cannot be avoided entirely, and noticeably affects livelihoods and socioeconomic development in affected areas. However, the lack of knowledge on the spatial variability of floods can result in poor understanding of its management. Therefore, flood susceptibility mapping is an important step toward flood risk management and decreasing flood damage. Several factors influence the occurrence of floods. The selection of influenc ing factors was based on IGR coefficients. Drainage density, rainfall, slope, NDVI, and LC were found to be the dominant factors affecting floods in the study area. However, geology has a minima l effect on floods. These findings are consistent with those of the studies conducted by 
Further, this study explored the relationship between LCC, PG, and increase in RD with relative changes in flood areas for the period between 2000 and 2017. Our results indicated that changes in land cover between 2000 and 2017 resulted in increased flood occurrence, especially in the downstream section of the study area. Flood incidents were more apparent in residential areas than in grasslands and barren land, because built-up areas hinder the infiltration of water and inhib it surface runoff. Although open and grassland areas cannot hinder the flow of water 
The increase in population density has caused rapid urbanization in Bangladesh. The changes in hydro-morphological cycles, reduction of natural drainage capacity and flooding in densely populated areas are mainly attributable to rapid urbanization. The findings of this study are consistent with those of previous studies conducted by 
and 
Specifically, roads may affect the volume of infiltrated water. This finding is in agreement with those of studies conducted by 
This study had three limitations. The first is the unavailability of relevant hydrological informa tio n such as flood depth, velocity, and discharge, precluding the development of a robust model. In addition, elevation data with 30 m spatial resolution appeared to be too coarse, especially in areas with flat topography. Unfortunately, a high-resolution elevation dataset is not available for monsoon regions such as Bangladesh. Finally, updated land use information for the study area is another constraint.
This study shows that flood hazards in Bangladesh are increasing as a result of increased floodplain development. The proposed algorithm can be a practical and novel approach to flood risk management in northeast Bangladesh and in similar settings. In addition, the findings could inform the development of adaption measures at a basin-scale and can guide the development of flood countermeasures by policymakers to minimize flood-related damage. Although the EM4 ensemble model was superior for flood susceptibility assessment in this case study, it can be tested in other environmental hazards such as landslides and debris flows.
As flooding is affected by growing anthropogenic activities (e.g., rapid changes in land cover) in combination with geographical factors (e.g., terrain characteristics), existing algorithms may be of little help. Hence, the proposed approach could provide a robust solution for quickly simula ting flood maps in data-sparse regions. In addition, the primary focus of this work was to evaluate and compare the modeling performances of different approaches and to identify the best alternative.
Although we applied this work to a specific area, the proposed method can be used in other areas with similar characteristics. Based on the available literature, we hope that this work will be helpful for future studies. Note that the accuracy of the outputs may be dependent on the environme nta l characteristics of the study area as well as input variables, wherein, hydrogeological and topographical variations may exist. However, the method used in this study can be employed in other areas to understand its sensitivity. | Conclusions: This study used machine learning techniques and various factors to clarify flood-susceptible areas in the northeast region of Bangladesh. The results demonstrated that anthropogenic activities such as rapid LCC led to more frequent and severe flooding, and climate change may worsen the situation. Therefore, sophisticated techniques are required to determine areas that are more susceptible to flooding. Of the three standalone and four ensemble models, BRBP-CART-EBF (EM4) yielded the highest AUC values (AUC > 90% in the training and testing stages) for the three flood events evaluated 
were considered accurate for delineating of areas that were susceptible to floods.
Furthermore, LCC that occurred in the downstream portion of the monitoring area was associated with changes in flooding areas between 2000 and 2017. In addition, flooding increases as RD and population increase. More specifically, a considerable decrease in waterbodies (+11.53% with SLCDI = 0.858%) and agricultural land (+25.94% with SLCDI = 0.90%) was observed, mostly due to rapid urbanization and population growth. This resulted in a decrease in the floodplain and disruption of floodwater by infrastructural development, resulting in greater flood susceptibility.
The resulting maps could inform strategies for reducing of flood vulnerability and aid in the development of adaptation measures. The major difference between the proposed approach and existing studies is that the ensemble algorithms, along with a standalone algorithm, are examined for the first time to predict floods. Hence, the novelty of this study contributes to new ensemble algorithms that can also be applied to other areas. In addition, the proposed ensemble algorithms are not only limited to floods; they can be utilized in different susceptibility mapping, for example,  | Figures caption: Fig.  | Tables caption: Table

Land Use Land Cover Change Analysis for Urban Growth Prediction Using Landsat Satellite Data and Markov Chain Model for Al Baha Region Saudi Arabia,Augusto Santos; Richarde Marques; Da Silva; Chunhui Li; Mohammad Alsharif; Abdulrhman Alzandi; Raid Shrahily; Babikir Mobarak,"Land Use Land Cover Change (LULCC) and urban growth prediction and analysis are two of the best methods that can help decision-makers for better sustainable management and planning of socioeconomic development in the countries. In the present paper, the growth of urban land use was analyzed and predicted in all districts of the El Baha region (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) based on high-resolution Landsat, 5, 7, and 8 satellite imagery during the period of study between 1985-2021. Using remote sensing techniques, the LULCC were obtained based on the maximum likelihood classification (MLC), where the geographic information system (GIS) had been used for mapping LULCC classes. Furthermore, Markov cellular automata (MCA) in Idrisi TerrSet was applied for assessing the future growth of urban land use between 2021-2047. The findings of the LULCC analysis based on the MLC indicate great socioeconomic development during the study period and that the urban expansion was at the expense of rangeland, forest and shrubland, and barren land and sand areas, with the contribution of each in the built-up area estimated to be around 9.1% (179.7 km 2 ), 33.4% (656.3 km 2 ) and 57.5% (1131.5 km 2 ), respectively. The simulation of the future LULCC period 2021-2047 revealed a loss in rangeland, forest and shrubland, and barren land and sand by 565, 144 and 105 km 2 , respectively, where rangeland is the most influenced, its land cover will decrease from 4002 to 3437 km 2 . From the obtained results based on MCA, urban growth is predicted to be large and it is estimated at around 2607 km 2 until the year 2047 with a net increase of 811 km 2 . The results obtained from this study may provide information to help decision-makers to implement efficient practices for future planning and management of the growth of urban land use, especially Saudi vision 2030.","Introduction: Land Use Land Cover Change (LULCC) is the modification of the Earth's surface by humans. Work to find the solution to the negative effects of such changes is ongoing despite humans being the root of the problems caused. LULCC is one of the primary contributors of greenhouse gas stocks resulting from direct human use of lands for commercial uses, settlements, and forestry activities 
Saudi Vision 2030 is a development plan started by the Saudi government in 2016 which aims to bring the country out of its historical oil rent by diversifying its economy and resorting to various privatizations  | Study Area: The Al-Baha region is one of the thirteen administrative regions that make up the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the most important of which are al-Mandaq, e Buljurshi, al-Qara, alAqiq, al-Makhwah, Qelwah and al-Baha City (Figure  | Study Area: The Al-Baha region is one of the thirteen administrative regions that make up the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the most important of which are al-Mandaq, e Buljurshi, al-Qara, alAqiq, al-Makhwah, Qelwah and al-Baha City (Figure 
The topography of the region is mostly mountains known as the Hijaz Mountains, and the mountainous areas are covered almost entirely by local coniferous juniper trees, in addition to many types of fruit trees, bushes, small shrubs, forests and flowers such as candi, basil, jasmine, Hijazi rose (Aqsh, raspberry) and Arfaj. Spreading on its slopes are terraces and agricultural terraces in which the residents grow the plants of the region that they rely on for food, such as sorghum, barley, wheat, millet, sesame, lentils, and local vegetables such as pumpkin, potatoes, carrots, tomatoes, peppers, and others.

Figure  | Materials and Methods:  | Remote Sensing Databases: In this study, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was applied to various Landsat imagery between 1985-2021 in order to assess LULCC in the framework of urban sprawl or urban growth. The different Landsat imagery: Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) used in this analysis are represented in Table 
The Landsat 8 satellite includes two types of sensors: OLI (Operational Earth Imager) and TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor). OLI includes all ETM+ domains. In order to avoid some characteristics of atmospheric absorption, OLI reset the bands, with relatively large modifications. The databases of LANSAT databases used in this analysis were obtained from  | The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index: The Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a standard indicator that allows for the creation of an image that displays greenness or relative biomass. This indicator benefits from the strong absorption by chlorophyll in the red band and the high reflectance from plant materials in the near-infrared (NIR) band 
This index defines values from -1.0 to 1.0, and represents mainly the vegetation, negative values are formed mainly from clouds, water and snow, and values close to zero are formed mainly by rocks and bare soil. Very small values (0.1 or less) correspond to empty areas of rock, sand, or snow. Medium values (from 0.2 to 0.3) represent shrubs and meadows. Values from 0.3 to 0.6 explain moderate vegetation, while large values (from 0.6 to 0.8) indicate temperate and tropical forests [43]. | The Maximum Likelihood Classification: The maximum likelihood classification (MLC) is one of the most frequently used supervised classifications, which states that every spectral class can be defined by a multivariate normal distribution and is founded on Bayes' theorem 
i: is the class x: n is the number of bands p(œâ i ): is the probability that class œâ i occurs in the image and is assumed the same for all classes
|‚àë i|: is a factor of the covariance matrix related to the data in œâ i Œ£ i -1 : is the reverse matrix m i is the mean vector Further details regarding the theoretical and mathematical implementation of MLC are provided in  | The Cellular Automata Markov Chain Model: A Markov chain (MC) is a term in mathematics that took the name of its Russian innovator, Andrea Markov. It is a stochastic process with a Markovian property. In such a process, the future is predicted from the present and does not need to know the past. A Markov chain follows a conditional probability distribution called the probability transition by-step in the process. The probability of transition in two, three or more steps is obtained from the probability of transition in one step 
where, S(t) and S(t + 1) are the status of the system at the time t and t + 1, respectively and P ij is the matrix of transition probability in a state, it is given as follows 
Pij: explains the probability of changing from the present state i to the next time state j. e. The low and high transition have a probability close to '0 and 1', respectively

After atmospheric correction, the maximum likelihood classification method was applied to produce LULCC results and mapping (net change, gain, loss and, persistence). 4.
The obtained results from ENVI 5.1 of LULCC were exported to Arcgis to improve the mapping observation and to improve the results management. 5.
Produced DEM, slope, aspect, hill shades, contours, distance from the road and distance from river maps using Arcgis based on SRTM imagery and used them as input in the prediction process. 6.
Opened land change modeler of TerrSet software, imported and inserted the LULCC maps of the years 1985 and 2021 and maps that were produced from STRM imagery 7.
Finally, transition potential and change prediction tools were run for the year 2047 to obtain a future LULCC map. | Results: The results of LULCC obtained from MLC of the years 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2015 and 2021 are represented in Figure 
The LULCC map analysis of the year 1985 revealed that the rangeland area was estimated to be around 5082 km 2 (47.55%). This area has increased by 689 km 2 to an area of 5772 km 2 (Figures 
The forest and shrubland area maps analysis illustrated high temporal variability in this class during the study period which had been estimated to be 5399 (48%), 4672 (42%), 5163 (45%), 5103 (46%), 4342 (39%), 4477 km 2 (40%) in the years 
One of the specific aims of the present study was to analyze and assess the built-up area or the urban area at the scale of each district of the study (Qelwah, Elmelkhwah, Elmandaq, ELBahah, Baljurish, Alatawlah and Alaqiq). Further to the results of Figures

Figure  | Discussion: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has divided the urban planning process into three main stages. The first stage is the policy formulation and planning stage which was determined between the years (2001-2005), most of the discussions that took place during this time period were related to the general perception of the project and its planning aspects. The second phase is the design phase where the technical aspects and design elements were to be determined in this time period 
In addition, During the period 1961-2017, global emission increases were governed by the three highest-emitting areas (sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia) resulting from land-use change and by the extensive and rapid increase in agricultural production  | Conclusions: In this paper, Landsat satellite imagery of the El Baha region has been used during the periods of 1985-2021 and 2021-2047 for LULCC analysis and urban growth prediction. The obtained results have been summarized in the following points: | ‚Ä¢: The results revealed a great socioeconomic development. The urban expansion was at the expense of rangeland, forest and shrubland, and barren land and sand areas, where the contribution of each one in the built-up areas was estimated at around 9.1% (179.7 km 2 ), 33.4% (656.3 km 2 ) and 57.5% (1131.5 km 2 ), respectively. | ‚Ä¢: The simulation of the future LULCC period 2021-2047 revealed a loss in rangeland, forest and shrubland, and barren land and sand by 565, 144 and 105 km 2 , respectively. | ‚Ä¢: The rangeland cover land is the most influenced, it will decrease from 4002 to 3437 km 2 . | ‚Ä¢: Based on MCA, it seems that urban growth will be extensive, it is estimated at around 2607 km 2 until the year 2047 with a net increase of 811 km 2 . | ‚Ä¢: The urban growth has been observed in the northern parts (districts) of the study area explaining an urban growth toward the north (Alaqiq, Baljurish and Alatawlah). | ‚Ä¢: The future simulation for the year 2047 shows that the Alaqiq district will have a great increase in the built-up areas by 471 km 2 from 661 and 1132 km 2 , followed by Baljurish, Qelwah and Elmandaq with a relatively non-significant increase of 77, 24, and 14 km 2 , respectively.
The results obtained from this study may provide information to help decision-makers to make efficient practices for future planning and management of the growth of urban land use, especially in Saudi vision 2030 for the different sectors (water resources mobilization, environment, energy, construction, agriculture and other sectors). The main strength of this study is the use of a relatively long period that allowed us to make a good assessment of LULCC in the study area, especially with the insufficient reports in this framework. The aims of sustainable development goals (SDGs) at restoring, protecting, and promoting sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, combating desertification, sustainably managing forests, and halting biodiversity loss degradation. Thus, one of the limitations of this study is that it cannot contribute to resolving SDGs problems. Further to the scope of this study, an investigation of current and future urban growth will be conducted at the scale of each district of the study area, focusing on the forest and urban green spaces assessment for better sustainable urbanization planning.","The effect of land-use change on the net exchange rates of greenhouse gases: A compilation of estimates (, , 2015) || Greenhouse gas assessment of soybean production: Implications of land use change and different cultivation systems (, , 2013) || IPCC Special Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (, , , , , , 2000) || Amazonia as a carbon source linked to deforestation and climate change (, , , , , , , , , , 2021) || What Are the Advantages and Disadvantages of Urbanization?

Spatiotemporal trends of urban-induced land use and land cover change and implications on catchment surface imperviousness,Tesfa Andualem; Stefan Peters; Guna Hewa; John Boland; Baden Myers,"Urbanization, changes in land use and land cover (LULC), and an increase in population collectively have significant impacts on urban catchments. However, a vast majority of LULC studies have been conducted using readily available satellite imagery, which often presents limitations due to its coarse spatial resolution. Such imagery fails to accurately depict the surface characteristics and diverse spectrum of LULC classifications contained within a single pixel. This study focused on the highly urbanized Dry Creek catchment in Adelaide, South Australia and aimed to determine the impact of urbanization on spatiotemporal changes in LULC and its implications for the land surface condition of the catchment. Very high spatial resolution imagery was utilized to examine changes in LULC over the past four decades. Support Vector Machine-learningbased image classification was utilized to classify and identify the changes in LULC over the study area. The classification accuracy showed strong agreement, with a kappa value greater than 0.8. The findings of this analysis showed that extensive urban development, which expanded the built-up area by 34 km 2 , were responsible for the decline in grass cover by 43.1 km 2 over the last 40 years . Moreover, built-up areas, plantation, and water features, in contrast to grass cover, have demonstrated an increasing trend during the study period. The overall urban expansion over the study period was 136.6%. Urbanization intensified impervious area coverage, increasing the runoff coefficient, equivalent impervious area, and curve number by 60.6%, 60.6%, and 7.9%, respectively, while decreasing the retention capacity by 38.6%. These modifications suggest a potential variability in catchment surface runoff, prompting the need for further research to understand the surface runoff changes brought by the changes in LULC resulting from urbanization. The findings of this study can be used for land use planning and flood management.","Introduction: Population growth and increased migration to urban areas have contributed to have increased urbanization affecting the LULC dynamics of an area 
The analysis of LULC changes is necessary to determine the extent and magnitude of urban expansion 
Several image classification methods, including the ISO cluster unsupervised classification, Maximum Likelihood (ML), random tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-nearest neighbor, can be used to produce a LULC map and assess the impact of urbanization 
The accuracy of LULC change detection studies are dependent on spatial scale or map resolution 
It is crucial to manage and mitigate the ecological and geomorphological effects of urban development by comprehending the effects of urbanization on fluvial systems and sedimentation through the analysis of spatiotemporal changes in urbanization 
The Dry creek catchment is an urbanized catchment in the metropolitan area of Adelaide, South Australia, with significant land use changes due to urban sprawl since the 1970s  | Materials and methods:  | Study area description: This study focused on the Dry Creek catchment, which is located in the Northern part of Adelaide, South Australia. The catchment is located between 138¬∞35‚Ä≤0‚Ä≥ and 138¬∞46‚Ä≤0‚Ä≥ E longitude and 34¬∞51‚Ä≤18‚Ä≥ and 34¬∞45‚Ä≤28‚Ä≥ S latitude (Fig. 
In contrast to the upper watershed, which is primarily rural, the lower catchment is primarily dense residential, commercial, and industrial, and contains some salt fields scheduled for development and various constructed wetlands. According to the Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure (DPTI) (Department of Planning Transport and Infrastructure 2017), the 30-year plan for Greater Adelaide showed that the Dry Creek catchment area has been marked as a potential urban growth area.
The increase in urban growth rises the impervious surface area with a potential of flooding to the downstream environment. | Data source: Very high-resolution aerial imagery 
Although raster imagery with smaller cell sizes results in a larger file size and takes longer to process, its importance in LULC classification cannot be overstated. This is due to its higher spatial resolution, which provides finer details of land surface features. The hydrologic soil group of the area was retrieved from the global hydrologic soil group and resampled to 2.5 m resolution using the nearest neighbor resampling technique to estimate the curve number   | Image classification: The number of LULC classes was determined by the current condition of the catchment by visual inspection of the ground information and the imagery, the spatial and spectral resolution of the imagery, the availability of various land use practices, and the intended purpose of the classification output or the fineness of the classification. Preliminary investigations were conducted by visiting the catchment and viewing high-resolution images on Google Earth Pro. Typical land use classes in urban settings include built-up areas, vegetation, water bodies and/or wetlands, green spaces, open land, and cropland 
The image segmentation procedure, which combines neighboring pixels that are similar in color and have geometric properties, is commonly utilized during image classification using SVM. Three criteria (spectral detail, spatial detail, and minimum segment size in pixels) govern the separation of images into objects in image segmentation. A classification schema is necessary to establish the number and type of classes to be utilized for supervised classification. In the ArcGIS Pro 3.0 environment, a schema with four LULC classes was created and saved in an Esri classification schema file (.ecs), which employs JSON syntax (https:// pro. arcgis. com/ en/ pro-app/ latest/ help/ analy sis/ image-analy st/ the-image-class ifica tion-wizard. htm accessed on December 15, 2022). User-defined training samples were prepared at randomly distributed locations (Fig.  | Classification accuracy: The assessment of image classification accuracy helps to evaluate the precision of classification results, ensuring the reliability of subsequent analysis and applications 
The OA that provides a comprehensive measure of how accurately the model predicts the correct class across all classes, is computed using Eq. 3  | Change detection: Post-classification comparison was used to detect changes in LULC at three different time periods. Change detection can be either a categorical change, pixel value change, or time series change. Categorical change computes the change between two thematic rasters and quantifies and explores the pixels that are changed or remained unchanged. The pixel value change computes the absolute or relative change between the two continuous raster images. Time series change uses LandTrendr to analyze changes in a multidimensional raster and compute the date on which each pixel changed. LandTrendr uses regression-and vertex-to-vertex-based trajectory fitting to detect abrupt events, such as disturbances, as well as longer duration processes, such as regrowth 
where Œî is percent change, R c is rate of change, R ue is rate of urban expansion, N is the number of years between the
two LULC maps, CA n-1 and CA n are the initial and final LULC class area coverage (in km 2 ), BA n-1 and BA n, are the built-up area at time t n-1 and t n (in km 2 ). The rate of urban sprawl/expansion between the three study periods was also determined using Eq. 7. | Impact of urbanization on surface imperviousness: Surface imperviousness is altered by urbanization; imperviousness can be evaluated in hydrological studies using the runoff coefficient, curve number, and retention capacity. In this study, built-up areas, such as buildings, parking lots, and roadways, were considered as impervious surfaces. The curve number represents the stormwater runoff capacity of a drainage basin. It is an empirical measure used in hydrology to anticipate direct runoff or infiltration from excess rainfall 
where CN composite is the composite curve number used for runoff volume computations; C w is the weighted runoff coefficient; i is an index for the catchment subdivisions of uniform land use and soil type; CN i is the curve number for subdivision i; C i is runoff coefficient value for each subdivision; EIA is the equivalent impervious area (km 2 ), and A i is the drainage area of subdivision i (km 2 ). | Results and discussion:  | Accuracy of LULC classification: The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient obtained from the confusion matrix agreed consistently demonstrated strong  | Spatiotemporal land use and land cover maps: The classification results revealed that in 1979, the catchment was dominated by grass cover occupying an area of 67.65 km 2 followed by built-up and plantation with 24.9 km 2 and 22.52 km 2 areal coverage, respectively ( From the spatial map of the LULC maps, it was observed that grass was dominantly found in the eastern and central parts of the catchment in 1979. Most plantation/tree LULC classes have been found in the eastern (upper) parts of the catchment over the last four decades (Fig.  | Spatiotemporal changes in LULC classes: The LULC maps for 1979, 2006, and 2019 indicated a substantial trend of LULC change over the last four decades. Notably, the built-up areas expanded by 33.98 km 2 (29.46%) while the grass cover diminished by 43.09 km 2 (33.73%) between 1979 and 2019. During this period, the rate of change of grass cover changes closely corresponded to the rate of the built-up area change, with a decrement of -1.08 km 2 /yr for grass cover and increment of 0.85 km 2 /yr for built-up areas (Table 
In comparison with the plantation and water classes, the built-up area increased extensively. Regardless, grass cover has consistently declined over all time periods. The water class increased due to the construction of Mawson Lakes and other reservoirs in some parts of the catchment and pond water in the upstream parts of the catchment in mining holes. Between 2006 and 2019, the rate of change in built-up area was 1.03 km 2 /yr; whereas, the rate of change in grass cover was -1.29 km 2 /yr.
Plantation coverage increased due to the implementation of Urban Forest Biodiversity Program (UFBP, 2002) and urban greening, which includes private greening, streetscapes and transportation corridors, riparian vegetation or green and blue corridors, and urban parks. Riparian landscapes (lands near rivers and streams) help to stabilize stream channel morphology, protect streams from upland pollution sources, and divert sediment-producing activities away from the stream 
Post-classification categorical LULC change detection was carried out in ArcGIS Pro 3.0. A significant transition from grass to built-up areas was noted due to increased population and urbanization, with strong demand for residential, commercial, and industrial buildings with car parks and roadways. There was also a visible transition from built-up area to grass cover. This was because places under development were entirely regarded as built-up areas and later developed with backyards and some trees, particularly in residential districts.
The spatial changes in LULC and urbanization showed that the central, northeastern, and southern parts of the catchment significantly changed from grass cover to builtup areas in the three consecutive study periods (Fig. 
Approximately 72.68 km 2 of the catchment area experienced categorical LULC changes between 1979 and 2019, with a maximum extent of 32.26 km 2 of grass cover    converted to built-up. During the study period, only 37.02% of the catchment area remained unchanged (Table 
The study found that urban expansion across the entire study period was 34 km 2 , with an average annual change rate of 3.41% specifically within the built-up area. This observation indicated that urban development in the study area has been increasing (Table  | Population growth and contributions to LULC: According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), Australia's population has increased by over 25% from 2001 to 2016, reaching twenty-four million people. Currently, 90% of Australians live in cities, which was 60% in 1911. Notably, overseas migration currently has accounted for slightly over 55% of Australia's population growth since 2001, making it as the predominant contributor to the country's population growth (ABS 2019). The Australian Bureau Statistics data for South Australia showed that the state's population increased by 251,420 residents between 1979 and 2006, followed by an increase 226,284 individuals between 2006 and 2021 (Table 
The population statistics of inner north suburbs of Adelaide, in which Dry Creek is located, has shown consistent upward trajectory from the baseline census population in 2016 to the 2036 projection (Table  | Urbanization impact on catchment surface imperviousness: The surface imperviousness of a catchment is highly interrelated to the runoff coefficient and runoff generation capacity 
Irrespective of the rainfall condition, the catchment's weighted curve number exhibited an increase from 80.94 to 87.37 (Table  | Conclusion: The study of LULC change caused by urbanization is crucial for analyzing the influence of urban sprawl on catchment surface imperviousness and its consequences for the hydrological processes of urban catchments. High-quality data and a reliable classification method using remote sensing are helpful in the study of changes in land use land cover. LULC classification utilizing high-quality images provide more accurate classification results, which can subsequently be used for environmental and hydrological studies. In the present study, very high-resolution aerial imagery with a resolution of 0.075 m and SPOT satellite imagery with a resolution of 2.5 m were utilized to assess the long-term spatiotemporal LULC changes caused by urban sprawl over the Dry Creek catchment. This study developed LULC maps of the area and assessed categorical changes in the catchment using an advanced and user-friendly ArcGIS Pro 3.0 environment employing the SVM method of image classification. Following an examination of the accuracy assessment performance indicators of automatic classification, image post-classification was demonstrated to improve the classification accuracy. The overall classification accuracy was found to be high, with kappa coefficient and overall accuracy results greater than 0.83 and 0.88, respectively. The SVM image classification approaches performed well in classifying high-resolution imageries, with good performance metrics. The built-up area, plantation and water expanded by 34.0 km 2 , 8.7 km 2 and 0.4 km 2 , respectively from 1979 to 2019, whereas grass cover declined by 43.09 km 2 , revealing a significant transformation in the LULC. Between 1979 and 2019, the study area has undergone substantial changes in land use and land cover. The LULC in the study area changed categorically by 62.98% during the study period. High rates of change were observed in the grass and built-up areas, with respective values of -1.08 and 0.85 km 2 /yr. Urbanization raised the impervious surface from 24.90 to 58.90 km 2 with 136.55% urban expansion. During the study period, an increase in surface imperviousness increased the runoff coefficient and curve number by 60.63% and 7.95%, respectively, while decreasing soil retention capacity by 38.56%. This undoubtedly increases the quantity of catchment surface runoff by increasing the risk of flooding to the downstream environment. The findings of this study have significant implications for the development and implementation of flood and stormwater control strategies. Therefore, future research should focus on how LULC changes caused by urbanization affect runoff and other hydrological and morphological catchment parameters.","Spatio-temporal simulation and prediction of land-use change using conventional and machine learning models: a review (, , , 2019. 2019) || Spatiotemporal change detection of carbon storage and sequestration in an arid ecosystem by integrating google earth engine and InVEST (the Jiroft plain, Iran) (, , , , , , 2022) || Spectral analysis of wetlands using multi-source optical satellite imagery (, , , , 2018) || Spatial evaluation of impacts of increase in impervious surface area on SCS-CN and runoff in Nagpur urban watersheds (, , , 2016) || Effects of urbanization on storm water run-off: a case study of Kathmandu Metropolitan City (, , , 2015) || Comparison of land use land cover classifiers using different satellite imagery and machine learning techniques (, , , , , , , 2022) || Geographic object-based image analysis-towards a new paradigm (, , , , , , , , , , 2014) || Linking stormwater BMP designs and performance to receiving water impact mitigation (, 2002) || Survey on SVM and their application in image classification (, , 2021) || Examining the effect of spatial resolution and texture window size on classification accuracy: an urban environment case (, , , 2004) || 39 urbanization and river channels (, , , , 2013) || Impact of the city on the rapid increase in the runoff and transport of suspended and dissolved solids during rainfall-the example of the silnica river (, , 2020) || Reliability of water supply from stormwater harvesting and managed aquifer recharge with a brackish aquifer in an urbanising catchment and changing climate (, , , , , , 2015) || A review of assessing the accuracy of classifications of remotely sensed data (, 1991) || Assessing the accuracy of remotely sensed data: principles and practices (, , , , , 2019. 1985) || Comparison of support vector machines and random forests for corine land cover mapping (, , , , , , , , , 2021) || Application of remote sensing for evaluation of land use change responses on hydrology of Muga watershed, Abbay River Basin (, , 2018. 2016 -36, December 2019. 2016-36, December 2019 release) || Time series analysis of land cover change using remotely sensed and multisource urban data based on machine learning: a case study of Shenzhen, China from 1979 to 2022 (, , , , , , , , , 2022) || Urbanization impacts on flood risks based on urban growth data and coupled flood models (, , , 2021) || Impact of satellite imagery spatial resolution on land use classification accuracy and modeled water quality (, , , , , 2018) || Harshness in image classification accuracy assessment (, 2008) || Spatiotemporal trends of urban land use/land cover and green infrastructure change in two Ethiopian cities: Bahir dar and hawassa (, , 2018) || Modelling land use/cover change to assess future urban sprawl in Romania (, , , , , , 2021) || An automatic approach for land-change detection and land updates based on integrated NDVI timing analysis and the CVAPS method with GEE support (, , 2018) || Modelling spatiotemporal trends of land use land cover dynamics in the abbay river basin Ethiopia (, , , , , , , 2022) || GCN250, new global gridded curve numbers for hydrologic modeling and design (, , , 2019) || Modeling relationship between land surface temperature anomaly and environmental factors using GEE and Giovanni (, , , , 2022) || Investigating the relationship between land use/ land cover change and land surface temperature using google earth engine; case study: melbourne (, , , , , , 2022) || Monitoring and modelling of urban sprawl using remote sensing and GIS techniques (, , , 2008. 2007) || Detecting trends in forest disturbance and recovery using yearly Landsat time series: 1.

The potential land requirements and related land use change emissions of solar energy,Dirk-Jan Van De Ven; I√±igo Capellan-Per√©z; I√±aki Arto; Ignacio Cazcarro; Carlos De Castro; Pralit Patel; Mikel Gonzalez-Eguino,"Although the transition to renewable energies will intensify the global competition for land, the potential impacts driven by solar energy remain unexplored. In this work, the potential solar land requirements and related land use change emissions are computed for the EU, India, Japan and South Korea. A novel method is developed within an integrated assessment model which links socioeconomic, energy, land and climate systems. At 25-80% penetration in the electricity mix of those regions by 2050, we find that solar energy may occupy 0.5-5% of total land. The resulting land cover changes, including indirect effects, will likely cause a net release of carbon ranging from 0 to 50 gCO 2 /kWh, depending on the region, scale of expansion, solar technology efficiency and land management practices in solar parks. Hence, a coordinated planning and regulation of new solar energy infrastructures should be enforced to avoid a significant increase in their life cycle emissions through terrestrial carbon losses.
The technologies harnessing renewable energy sources are characterized by a power density several orders of magnitude lower than fossil fuels 1 . As a consequence, the transition to these sources of energy is expected to intensify the global competition for land 
For sources of renewable energy other than bioenergy, land requirements and the associated environmental impacts remain understudied in the literature from a quantitative point of view 1,10 . In the case of solar energy, the land competition element is usually expected to be negligible due to its higher relative energy density compared to bioenergy and the possibility to integrate it in urban areas or non-productive land 7,14-16 , and as such is currently excluded from official statistical reporting and integrated assessment models (IAMs). However, recent studies based on satellite views of utility-scale solar energy (USSE) under operation, either in the form of photovoltaics (PV) or concentrated solar power (CSP), show that their land use efficiency (LUE) is up to six times lower than initial estimates 
The installation of USSE on land is subject to a diversity of constraints: solar resource constraints, which are related to the solar irradiance in a certain area; geographical constraints such as the slope and the existing use of the land; and regulatory constraints, e.g. the protected status of the land, often related to ecosystem and wildlife preservation ","Solar land occupation.: Table 
The future land requirements of solar energy obtained for each scenario and region can be put in perspective compared, for example, to the current level of built-up area and agricultural cropland. In the three regions, a large part of the total built-up area (urban and solar land) will consist of solar PV panels or CSP heliostats by 2050 if at least half of the produced electricity comes from solar power. Land for solar would amount to over 50% of the current EU urban land, over 85% for India, and over 75% in Japan and South-Korea. From a different perspective, a significant part of the sunlight captured for commercial use would be used for electricity generation instead of growing crops, especially in Japan and South-Korea (29-39%) and the EU (8-10%). The relative projected land area dedicated to either crops or solar energy strongly differs within each region, with potential local ecosystem and landscape implications (see Figure 
Land cover changes. Solar energy infrastructure currently occupies a negligible amount of land globally.
Our results show that this changes in scenarios with a high share of solar energy in the future electricity mix. Figure 
Figure  | Table 1.: Land occupation characteristics at different solar penetration levels by 2050. Ranges show results for with different future solar module efficiencies with left values within each solar-related column representing 28% efficiency and right values 20%. Results for bioenergy scenarios included for comparison. a These are realized penetration levels. See Section 1b in the SM for more information. b Land suitable for commercial purposes does not include the use of rooftop space, deserts or dry scrublands that are not suitable for crop, pasture or forest cultivation. Deserts and dry scrublands in India host about 11.5-12% of solar energy throughout all penetration scenarios of solar energy in India (see Figure  | Solar energy versus bioenergy.: IAMs which link energy, economy, land and climate modules tend to rely strongly on the cultivation of dedicated bioenergy crops (such as switchgrass and miscanthus) in global climate change mitigation scenarios 
Table 
deserts and dry scrublands, as well as bioenergy from waste or agricultural and forestry residue, are assumed not to contribute to LUC emissions nor carbon sequestration. | Discussion: By representing the land requirements of solar energy within an IAM that integrates energy, land, socioeconomic and climate systems, we were able to, for the first time in the literature to our knowledge, estimate the land cover impacts and related LUC emissions of solar energy within climate change mitigation scenarios up to 2050. The obtained results represent a contribution to the novel field of research which analyses the environmental impacts of significantly up scaling renewables other than biomass 
A combination of technical and geopolitical reasons complicates the installation of solar energy far from consumption points. Therefore, a high share of solar generation in the energy mix in relatively densely populated regions with high per capita energy demands can require a significant share of domestic land, comparable to the current built-up area in these regions. The most relevant factors influencing the land use per unit of solar energy are solar irradiation, latitude, and future solar module efficiencies. At the domestic level, solar energy is found to predominantly compete for land with cropland and managed forests, while on a global scale, 27 to 54% of the land required for solar energy is found to indirectly displace unmanaged forests, predominantly outside the Table  | Solar penetration level: Using an existing IAM to study the potential land impacts of solar energy expansion, we were bound to the limitations of this model. One of these was the division of land zones in the model (corresponding to Agro-Ecological zones, see ""Methods"" section), which determine the boundaries of the geographical competition to host solar energy within each region. This pre-defined distribution was originally designed to capture variations in crop yields, and is not ideal for defining the geographical diversity of solar energy ""yields"" within a region. Although a general good correspondence is found, there are also exceptions (see Figure 
To date, land use for solar energy is negligible compared to other human land uses. However, the obtained results show that in future scenarios, with a largely decarbonized electricity system, high penetration rates of solar energy will require significant amounts of land to be occupied by solar power plants. Further work applying ecological tools should be focused towards investigating the implications of these additional land occupation levels -including the additional transmission power lines-in terms of habitat fragmentation and ecosystem disturbance. Siting policies for USSE should avoid adverse land impacts and limit land competition, for example by excluding high yield cropland as already performed in some countries  | Methods: The Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), version 4.3, has been used as a base for this study 
In order to identify the effects that solar energy and bioenergy pathways have on land use and land use change emissions, three pathways have been modelled achieving a defined penetration level in the electricity mix from The land occupation of solar and bioenergy (Figs. 
Land competition in GCAM. Land use and agricultural output in GCAM version 4.3 are calibrated for pre-defined Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZs), which sub-divide geo-political regions in 18 different types of land regions, based on differences in climate zones (tropical, temperate, boreal) and the length of growing periods for crops 
Land use in GCAM has been divided in different nodes that affect the level of competition between different uses (see Figure  | Solar land-use module.: An additional module has been developed for the GCAM model to link the consumption of solar energy with land use, competing with other commercial (crops, timber and intensive pastures) and non-commercial (natural forest, grassland, scrubland) land uses. Specifically, the solarland category is included in the ""Crops"" land node (Figure 
To define the value of land for hosting solar energy, a yield in terms of energy output per unit of land has been defined for every AEZ. Equation (4) defines this yield for each AEZ, which depends on average solar irradiation (I) per AEZ, average efficiency of solar power plants (f 1 ) at the year of installation (t), the averaged performance ratio over the life cycle of the solar power plant (f 2 ) and the land occupation ratio (f 3 ) 1,17 . To estimate I per AEZ, (1) Land occupation i,p,r = land for i i,p,r -land for i NL,p,r 
we overlapped the solar irradiance annual average data 
Figure  | Impact of solar energy infrastructure on local carbon cycle. The impact of USSE infrastructures: on local microclimates is a field in early research stages, although some case studies have been performed. In the case of solar energy on pastures in wet climates, a significant loss of carbon in vegetation and soils can be expected in the land below the infrastructure that is permanently blocked from sunlight, but the year-round carbon cycle in gap areas between rows of solar panels will be hardly affected 
‚Ä¢ Land clearing: Clearing and grubbing of soil and roots, topsoil stripping and stockpiling, land grading and levelling, and soil compaction. Existing vegetation that supports habitat is removed and any other vegetation is often discouraged; weeds and other unwanted vegetation are generally managed with herbicides and by covering the ground with gravel; this is a common practice in various countries 
; Œ≤ and ‚àÖ in radians is based on a rationale of balancing cost minimisation (i.e. no seeding, no herbicides) with land conservation (i.e. minimising ecosystem disturbance). ‚Ä¢ Pasture conversion: Irrespective of the previous land use, all land below and around the infrastructure is (re)seeded with grass before or right after the construction phase, and the land will be managed as pasture, allowing for extensive animal grazing around the solar modules 
The impacts of each of these solarland management regimes on the local carbon cycle depend on the specific location, and the previous land use, and result from off-model calculations applied to the GCAM scenario outcomes which provide land cover changes per year, AEZ, and scenario. Section 2d of the SM gives full details on all applied assumptions and derived carbon cycle impacts.
Use of non-competing space on rooftops and in deserts and dry scrublands. Rooftop space is often used for smaller scale PV systems and has the advantage of not competing for space with other uses and avoiding some of the losses related to electricity transmission and distribution. On the other side, rooftop spaces are often not optimal, and only about 2 to 3% of urbanized surface area can be used for PV systems with reasonable efficiencies (taking into account specific factors such as roof slopes and shadows between buildings) 
Land that is not used and neither has potential for any other productive use from a human perspective, such as deserts and dry scrublands, can be suitable for solar energy. By default, deserts are exempted from land competition in GCAM, while only 10% of current scrublands are included in the land competition module in GCAM v4.3, taking into account both non-fertility of scrublands as well as the protected status of some of these land areas. The EU, Japan and South-Korea have limited amounts of deserts and scrublands (see Table

"The impact of land use and land cover changes on socioeconomic factors and livelihood in the Atwima Nwabiagya district of the Ashanti region, Ghana",Emmanuel Daata Kullo; Eric Forkuo; Ernest Biney; Emmanuel Harris; Jonathan Arthur Quaye-Ballard,"Land use and land cover change (LULCC) is a general term for the human modification of Earth's terrestrial surface. These modifications come by direct and indirect activities of human actions when securing essential resources. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze these land changes for the best management of natural resources and to ensure better livelihood of the inhabitants.
The influx of population from the Kumasi metropolis and peripheral areas coupled with urbanization is causing rapid changes to LULC in the Atwima Nwabiagya District. This has put pressure on the land cover especially in the forest cover areas and has affected the socioeconomic activities in the district. In view of this problem, this research sought to map and analyze the spatio-temporal LULCC patterns using multi-temporal satellite images from 1986-2019 and to identify the socioeconomic factors and their impact of LULC on the study area. Seven LULC classes were identified including; bare land, closed forest, cropland, open forest, savannah, settlement, and water. The results showed that during the period under review  there have been losses of 4178.5 hectares (7%) in closed and open forest and bare land whilst crop land and settlement have seen an increase of 21685.3 hectares (37%). In all, settlement establishment as a result of population increase, commercial activities, and porous land tenure system was identified as the main factors for LULCC in the Atwima Nwabiagya District.","Introduction: Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) change have been occurring since time immemorial, it is, however, rapid recently due to increasing anthropogenic activities including urbanization and industrialization 
Many research works have pointed out the relevance of investigating the land cover dynamics as a tool for justifiable supervision of allnatural possessions 
Though the Atwima Nwabiagya district is one of the fastest-growing areas in Ashanti region ( GSS, 2012 ), adequate information on LULC change over a considerable period is non-existent. There is there-fore the need to research into the socio-economic implications of LULC change on the entire district using RS and GIS. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) are cost-effective and well-established technologies in understanding landscape dynamics  | Materials and methods:  | Study area: With its capital at Nkawie-Kuma, the district is bordered to the west by both Ahafo Ano South and Atwima Mponua Districts, it is bounded in the east by the Afigya Kwabre District as well as Kumasi Metropolis. To the north, it forms a boundary with Offinso Municipal as well as Amansie West and Atwima Kwanwoma Districts to the south. Its latitudinal extent is estimated to be 6¬∞32 Àà and 6¬∞75 Àà in the northern hemisphere whilst the longitudinal boundaries are 1¬∞45 Àà and 2¬∞00 Àà in the western hemisphere ( Fig.  | Data and software used: Satellite images of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) for 1986, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM + ) for 2003, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM + ) for 2007, and Landsat 8 Operational Land Image and Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI and TIRS) for 2019 with Path 194 and Row 055 (P194R055) were acquired from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) earth explorer website for classification and analysis. The images used had a cloud cover of less than 10% and a spatial resolution of 30m √ó 30m. However, the inability to use images with equal intervals was due to the high consideration in using images with less than 10% cloud cover. Table  | Image pre-processing: The Landsat 7 image acquired on 13 th January 2007had line gaps on the image ( Fig.  | Image classification: Identification of the LULC classes and their spatial distributions for better land utilization by both inhabitants and policymakers is a major objective in this study. As a test classification method, an amalgam of supervised and unsupervised classification approaches was used to improve the accuracy of the classification  | Accuracy assessment: According to  | Table 2: LULC classes and their descriptions. | LULC Classes Description: Water This is made of the Barekese and Owabi Dams which are the main water bodies in the study area. Settlements This is dominated by residential and industrial structures most of which showed urban, peri-urban, and rural characteristics. Bare land This is comprised of uncovered rock surfaces and other uncovered zones coming about because of both human activities and natural causes. | Savannah: This comprises all the creeping and elephant grasses scattered across the study area. | Open Forest: The vegetation here is dominated by sparsely scattered trees with open canopies. Closed Forest This is made up of rainforest and moist semi-deciduous forest trees with three layers of emergent, canopies, and undergrowth. Crop Land Land used mainly for both cash and food crops cultivation.
the accuracy of such data should be assessed by juxtaposing the classified image data with some other independently acquired data or reference data or ancillary data (Ground Truthing) of the same area. In this project, accuracy assessment was done using the Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin (SCP) in QGIS. A classification error matrix was also formed to articulate the accuracy by tabulating the classified image data and the reference data. Overall accuracy, producer's accuracy, user's accuracy, and Kappa statistics are the elements common in precision valuation and therefore were calculated. | Change detection: Change detection is relevant in image analysis since it enables us to determine the gains or losses in the land classes identified  | Socio-economic analysis: To examine the socio-economic factors of LULC change and their impact on the environment and livelihood of the district, a quantitative and qualitative research design was employed. For the quantitative research design, close-ended questionnaires were used whereas the qualitative design used interview guided to offer respondents, especially family heads, the opportunity to explain further the issues of LULC change affecting the study area. Lopez-Fernandez and Molina-Azor√≠n (2011) noted that the use of both quantitative and qualitative methods does not only reflect the respondents' accurate responses, it also provides flexible methodology in the research. This is not very different from 
A purposive or judgemental non-probabilistic sampling technique was used during data collection. This was because communities towards the Kumasi metropolis were noted (from the satellite image analysis) to be experiencing greater changes in LULC. The questionnaires and interview guide were therefore purposively administered around such communities to ascertain the reasons behind such changes. In all, 11 communities from a total of about 53 peri-urban and rural communities were selected as a sample frame which is representative enough for the research. The sample frame was designed to target heads of various households in the study communities. In the case of multiple households, structured questionnaires were administered to all available heads of households and their occupants.
The sample size was heads of households from the eleven selected communities namely; Abuakwa, Nkawie-Kuma, Asenemaso, Toase, Nerebehi, Maakro, Agog, Sepaase, Manhyia, Mim, and Hiawu Besease. The sample size was gotten using the Eq. ( 
where; n is the sample size, N is the total number of people in the eleven communities, e is the margin of error (0.05), and 1 is a constant. Administered questionnaires were cleaned and entered into SPSS to generate results and analysis. Descriptive and inferential statistics such as frequencies and regression were employed in analyzing the data. | Results and discussions: 3.1.  | landsat images: As shown in Fig. 
However, in 2003, there was a slight improvement in some classes. Open forest decreased marginally to 4167.2 hectares representing 7.2 % whilst closed forest declined to 4.5 % or 2620.2 hectares ( Fig. 
In 2007, dams classified as water continued to decrease significantly to 2.5% with an area coverage of 1453 hectares. LULC classes of settlements, bare land, and crop land saw an increment to 13611.6 hectares representing 23.5%, 12200.6 hectares representing 21.1%, and 14762.9 hectares representing 25.5 % respectively ( Fig. 
Analysis of the 2019 classified image showed some interesting dynamics in settlements and cropland. The total land area for settlements realized its highest increase to 25900.6 hectares which translates into 44.7%. Cropland also decreased in area to 10911.1 hectares, representing 18.8%. There was also an increase in closed forest coverage to a total area of 1314.6 hectares which is 2.3% of the study area. Savannah land cover saw a significant reduction to 9365.4 hectares (16.2%) which is a considerable reason for a rise in settlement ( Fig. 
A composite analysis of LULC classes shows that there is has been a significant change in the two dams classified as water from 1986 to 2019. The other land cover classes however realized appreciable changes from one period to another. In 17 years  | Accuracy assessment: In the study, Kappa was computed using QGIS software. The overall classification accuracies  | Socio-economic analysis: This section presents the results of the socio-economic analysis by analyzing key socioeconomic factors or indicators of the changes within the district and the effect of these factors or drivers. | Comparison of the types of land cover that existed before and after respondents settled in the district: Table  | Table 5: Types of land cover that existed before and after respondents settled in the district.  18.4%, 13.5% and 24.9% in that order. It is important to note that these variations have occurred over the period because of the numerous socioeconomic features, for instance, demographic increase, farming activities as well as urban growth prevailing in the district. These factors have led to a rapid increase in human activities such as putting up residential buildings to house the rising population and also meet the demand for accommodation among others. A lot of challenges have arisen due to the massive modifications in LULC in the district over the period. Notably, traffic congestion partly because of the vigorous movements most business people undertake, conflicts in land ownership as a result of selling one parcel of land to more than one person by some of the subchiefs as well as social vices occurring out of urban growth and struggle to meet the high living conditions are some of the challenges inhabitants are grappling with. | Major socioeconomic drivers and human activities causing LULC change in Atwima Nwabiagya District: Several activities contributed to the notable modifications of landuse changes that took place in the district over the period. Fig. 
Generally, the influx of population either as migrants or through natural increase as well as infrastructural expansion are major socioeconomic drivers leading to increases in residential establishments, agricultural activities, commercial and industrial expansions, and administrative activities. These are fueled by the porous land tenure system and the quest for money by some sub-chiefs in the district.  | 3.3.3: Impact of socioeconomic factors of LULC on the livelihood of people in the study area: There has also been a negative impact of LULC on livelihoods in Atwima Nwabiagya district through the reduction in forest cover and high cost of accommodation since there are a lot of immigrants and urbanization in the area is increasing exponentially. 72 and 59 respondents representing 29.4% and 24.1% respectively from the data showed that the socioeconomic factors of urbanization and population increase have resulted in the continued reduction in forest cover and high cost of land and accommodation in the district. These result in high living conditions for the people in the study area. The analysis of the socioeconomic drivers on livelihood is presented in Fig.  | Summarized discussion on the analyzed data: After the statistical analysis, the information revealed that the predominant occupation in the district is Farming and Trading with most of the inhabitants being migrants who quest for land property, and agriculture. The predominant size of the household is from 1 to 5 people in a house which is mostly a single household. The household is made up of parents and children with relatives. The condition of the household is either mud or a blockhouse. Most of the inhabitants have stayed in the area for less than 5years and mostly 6-10years and this shows that the area is presently occupied more by immigrants. Most of the land in the area was acquired through inheritance and lease. This indicates that most of the lands are family lands. The average land sizes that are owned by the inhabitants through inheritance or lease are 3acres to 10acres.
The types of land cover that were initially prevailing in the area were open and closed forest. The most common land use is residential and agricultural. This has increased the land use in settlement, Bare land, and croplands by reducing the Forest areas.
The socio-economic factors that are prevailing in the area are building of residential zones since there are a lot of immigrants and Agricultural activities since most inhabitants are farmers and traders. This has resulted in challenges in land ownership as a result of land disputes and traffic congestion. There has also been a negative impact of LULC on livelihoods in Atwima Nwabiagya district through the reduction in forest cover and high cost of accommodation since there is a rise of the number of immigrants and urbanization in the area is increasing exponentially. | Conclusion: Landsat images were used for classification to reveal the major LULC changes within the Atwima Nwabiagya for the period 1986 to 2019. It was revealed that forests (closed and open) reduced continuously from 1986 (about 14.9%) to 9.4% in 2007. It however increased marginally between 2007 and 2019 partly due to the government afforestation programme. Built up (settlement establishment) improved to 44.7% (2019) from 12.3%

"Hydrological responses to human-induced land use/land cover changes in the Gidabo River basin, Ethiopia",Henok Aragaw; Manmohan Goel; Surendra Mishra; S Archfield; V Samadi,"Land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes in the Gidabo basin, Rift Valley, Ethiopia, have greatly affected the hydrology of the basin. This study integrates hydrological modelling with statistical analysis to evaluate the hydrological response of LULC changes during the period 1988-2018. Using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) models, the influences of individual LULC changes on different components of the hydrological cycle are assessed. The results of the Mann-Kendall test showed no significant trends in annual rainfall over the basin at the 95% significance level. Change in LULC resulted in an increase in annual mean surface runoff by 23.6 mm during the period 1988-2018. Meanwhile, the annual mean baseflow, lateral flow, percolation and evapotranspiration (ET) were reduced by 9.1, 4.2, 10.2 and 12.2 mm, respectively. PLSR analysis indicated that cultivated land affected the lateral flow and ET negatively in contrast to agroforestry and grassland, which had a positive influence.","Introduction: Water is one of the most important natural resources on which all living things thrive. It goes through a system of circulation among ocean, atmosphere and land, known as the hydrological cycle 
Hydrological models are generally used to evaluate the effects of LULC changes on hydrological processes. These models simulate the spatial as well as temporal responses of various LULC changes on the hydrological components in a river basin 
In addition to quantifying the impacts of gross LULC changes on hydrological components using a hydrological model, it is also important to scrutinize the effect and contribution of each LULC change on different hydrological components of a catchment 
In Ethiopia, anthropogenic activities have affected the availability of water resources in river basins  | Study area: The Gidabo watershed (Fig.  | Data availability: The dataset required for the SWAT model setup includes a digital elevation model (DEM), soil map, LULC map and the climate data. The Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) DEM from the US Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Explorer (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov), with 30 m √ó 30 m resolution, was processed in ArcGIS and used in this study. Images from the Landsat satellite (Table 
The SWAT model requires daily meteorological data as input. Therfore, the daily precipitation data, and maximum and minimum daily temperature data, for eight stations from 1987 to 2018 were obtained from the National Meteorological Services Agency of Ethiopia. After analysing the data, six rainfall stations and five temperature stations were selected. The observed daily streamflows of two gauging sites were obtained from the Ministry of Water, Irrigation and Electricity of Ethiopia for model calibration and validation. Finally, all the input data for the study basin were processed for input to the SWAT model. | Methodology adopted:  | Trend and change-point analysis: Assessing the presence of trends in hydro-climatological variables is vital for distinguishing and understanding changes in hydrological elements  | Image classification and LULC change detection: For LULC change detection, Landsat images were first preprocessed to enhance the quality and visibility of features 
Ground truth points of 191 locations were utilized for accuracy assessment of the images from 2018. However, for the images from 1988 and 2000, 149 and 155 reference data, obtained from Google Earth, were used. Overall accuracy and Kappa statistics, derived from the error matrix, were used to evaluate the accuracy. ERDAS 2018 and ArcGIS 10.5 were used for image classification and mapping. The LULC maps for the years 1988, 2000 and 2018 are shown in Fig. 
where ChangeRate is the rate of change (km 2 /year); A is the area of LULC (km 2 ) at time t -2; B is the area of LULC (km 2 ) at time t -1; and Z is the time interval between A and B (years). | Description of the SWAT model: SWAT is a semi-distributed physically based simulation model that can predict the effect of climate and anthropogenic alterations on the hydrological systems in watersheds with varying soils, land-use and management conditions over long periods 
where SW t is the final soil water content (mm), SW 0 is the initial soil water content on day i (mm), t is the time (d), R d is the amount of precipitation on day i (mm), Q s is the amount of surface runoff on day i (mm), E a is the amount of evapotranspiration on day   | Set-up and calibration of the SWAT model: The model SWAT Version 2012 
In line with the suggestion of  | Model application: To evaluate the effects of LULC changes on hydrological components at basin and sub-basin scales, simulations with the calibrated SWAT model were carried out by separately considering the LULC maps for the years 1988, 2000 and 2018 as inputs to the model. | PLSR model: The PLSR technique is an extension of multivariate analysis, which combines the features of principal component analysis and multiple regressions 
Assessing the hydrological responses using the hydrological model is not done to reveal the relationship of individual LULC classes with, or their influence on, components of the water budget 
where a is the regression coefficient for the intercept and b is the regression coefficient for variables 1, . . ., n, computed from the data. Here, the dependent variables represent the changes in the surface runoff, water yield, base flow, lateral flow, percolation and evapotranspiration, while the independent variables represent the changes in the cultivated land, evergreen forest, agroforestry, grassland, shrubland and urban area. Furthermore, the degree of influence of independent variables on dependent variables is explained by the variable importance in the projection (VIP) 
Initially, the multicollinearity of the LULC classes was measured by tolerance and variable inflation factor (VIF)  | Results and discussion: The results obtained with respect to the various analyses performed in the study are presented in this section. | Trend and change-point analysis: The results of the MK trend test for annual rainfall at six stations in around the Gidabo watershed are summarized in Table 
The basin-wide areal rainfall trend showed no significant change in annual rainfall in the Gidabo watershed (Fig.  | Evaluation of LULC change and accuracy assessment: The Landsat satellite images, in combination with unsupervised and supervised classification techniques, were used to map the LULC in the study watershed in the years 1988, 2000 and 2018, and, subsequently, changes in the LULC characteristics were calculated. Around 150 or more reference ground truth locations were used to assess the accuracy of the classification. The error matrix (Table

The baseflow in 45 sub-basins demonstrated a decreasing pattern during 1988 and 2018, with the most significant reduction occurring in the southern and central parts of the basin. Meanwhile, the yearly average ET in all sub-basins decreased by 15.13 mm, with the most extreme decrease in the southern part of the basin (Fig.

Grassland is seen to have an excellent association with surface runoff, water yield, lateral flow and ET, with correlation coefficients of -0.47, -0.57, +0.50 and +0.62, respectively. In contrast, grassland has a relatively low correlation with baseflow (-0.21) and percolation (-0.21). The regression coefficient (Table

In general, the surface runoff and water yield are profoundly related to change in the cultivated and urban areas. In contrast, baseflow, lateral flow, percolation and ET are negatively related to change in cultivated and urban areas. Moreover, baseflow, lateral flow, percolation and ET are highly positively related to alteration of evergreen forest, agroforestry and grassland, while surface runoff inversely correlates to alteration in these areas. The shrubland LULC classes also show a positive or negative impact on all hydrological components (Table  | Conclusions: In this study, an attempt is made to assess the hydrological responses to LULC changes using the SWAT model and statistical analysis. The following conclusions can be derived from the study:
1. The MK test showed no significant trend in basin-wide annual rainfall during the study period  at the 95% significance level. The Pettitt test too could not detect any break in the basin-wide annual rainfall. Hence, any change in hydrological components during the study period  might be attributable to the effects of LULC changes. 2.

"Past and future prediction of land cover land use change based on earth observation data by the CA-Markov model: a case study from Duhok governorate, Iraq",Nabaz Khwarahm; Peshawa Najmaddin; Korsh Ararat; Sarchil Qader; Lulc Ca-Markov; Gis Iraq; Rs,"Understanding land use land cover change (LULCC) dynamics is crucial for sustaining the integrity of structure and function of ecosystems. As such, frequent measuring and monitoring of LULCC are necessary. Over the last four decades, Duhok governorate in the north of Iraq has undergone sweeping changes caused mainly by anthropogenic factors (e.g. population growth). This study used geospatial techniques and the synergy Cellular Automata (CA)-Markov approach to quantify past, current and model the future changes of LULC. The maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) was employed to conduct classification for three consecutive-year Landsat imagery (i.e. 1988, 2008 and 2017). From the classified imageries, three LULC maps with several classes were created and then, change detection analysis was implied. The classified (1988-2008) and (2008-2017)  LULC maps were incorporated into the hybrid model to predict LULC maps for 2017 and 2060, respectively. The classified 2017 LULC maps were used as a reference to validate the model output for 2017.
Relatively high accuracy agreements were achieved between the classified and the modelled maps (Kno= 0.8315, Klocation= 0.8267, Kstandard = 0.7978). The model classes estimated for 2060 compared to the classified 2017 LULC classes revealed that dense forest, sparse forest, agricultural land and barren area would decrease by -26.26% (from 327.08 to 241.08 km 2 ), -0.76% (from 2372.29 to 2355.82 km 2 ), -5.86% (from 973.21 to 916.27 km 2 ) and -10.03% (from 2918.9-2626.19 km 2 ), respectively. In contrast, the urban area would significantly increase by 271.19%, (from 161.99 to 602.19.8 km 2 ).
Dense forest in Duhok governorate has seen remarkable decline from 1988 to 2017, and future predictions demonstrated that the declining trend would continue. Dense forest would predominantly convert to sparse forest and barren areas, suggesting forest thinning and clearing. Urban areas were the most dynamic cover types that increased significantly between 1998 and 2017. This trend would continue to increase from 2.36% (2017) to 8.76% (2060). Urbanization would be predominantly at the cost of agricultural land and barren area. Information on spatiotemporal dynamics of LULCC has been proved as an effective measure for maintaining the integrity of the ecosystem components through sustainable planning and management actions.","Introduction: Land use land cover (LULC) is an important component of the environmental systems. Any changes to LULC can cause many environmental and ecological problems at various spatial scales 
Geospatial technologies, remote sensing (RS) data and geographic information system (GIS) are currently considered to be the most cost-effective and accurate source of information for the detection of changes in LULC 
In addition, there are different models that can be used for LULCC simulation and modelling, such as statistical models 
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Report 2019 
Tracing the impact of urban change on sustainability through time can supply vital information required for sustainable urban progress, particularly in areas where anthropogenic and natural factors are a constant risk  | Materials and methods:  | Study area: Duhok governorate is located in the north of Iraq, bordering Syria and Turkey, situated between latitudes 36¬∞-37.5¬∞N and longitudes 42¬∞-44¬∞E, with elevations >580 m above sea level (Fig.  | Historical satellite imagery: Satellite images (30 m spatial resolution and the least cloud cover) from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 8 (OLI TIRS) of three historical years

The Markov chain model (MCM) depends on stochastic process which means that how random variable changes over time 
The CA-Markov is an effective combination between the MCM to predict temporal changes in LULC and cellular automata models to predict spatial LULCC, hence, the integrated CA-Markov model can be used effectively to predict spatiotemporal changes in LULCC  | Model validation: Model validation is a crucial step to evaluate the accuracy of predicted data. In this study, the validation was completed by using the classified 2017 LULC map as reference data against the predicted 2017 LULC map based on the standard Kappa index of agreement variations, which have been widely used to validate LULC predictions

As shown in  . During that period, the sparse forest has slightly increased by 1.47% whilst, agricultural land and urban area have significantly increased by 223.2% (300 km 2 to 973 km 2 ), and 448.84% (29 km 2 to 161 km 2 ) respectively. In contrast, the dense forest, barren area and waterbody have decreased by -33.43%, -18.69% and -3.35%, respectively (Table  | Comparison between actual LULC and modelled LULC map of 2017: The degree of agreement between the actual LULC map and the modelled LULC map for the 2017 was R 2 = 0.98 (coefficient of determination) (Fig.  | Discussion: In the study of environmental change, ecosystem integrity (e.g. structure and function), urban planning and sustainability, LULCC has become a key subject that needs to be   
Interesting trends can be seen in the change statistics 
Oppositely, the area of sparse forest slightly increased as this class, in some circumstances, can be a transition stage between dense forest and other classes. Respectively, agricultural lands were increased with a clear jump in 2017. This is likely due to the influence of a recent policy that was implemented by the central government which have encouraged local farmers to increase agricultural production particularly wheat. Across Iraq, the central government has allocated silos to buy wheat from farmers for a pre-declared price above the market price 
The land use type that increased the most over the last four decades is urban area, which increased by six times from 0.37 to 2. 
Increasing the population and development of infrastructure can result in accelerating urban expansion  | Conclusion: Quantifying and predicting spatiotemporal dynamics of LULCCs have become a prerequisite for planning decisions and conserving the integrity of the ecosystems, particularly urban ecosystem as human population grows. Geospatial technologies together with land surface modellers (e.g. CA-Markov) are effective tools in providing invaluable information on the patterns of LCLCs over space and time. Understanding the patterns of changes would supply guidance to various scientific disciplines, for example, biodiversity conservation, sustainable urban systems and environmental management actions.
Dense forest in the Duhok governorate has seen remarkable decline from 1988 to 2017, and future predictions demonstrated that this trend would continue (i.e. from 2017 to 2060). Dense forest cover would predominantly convert to sparse forest and barren areas, suggesting forest thinning and clearing. Therefore, management actions should focus on protecting the forest areas as part of the sustainable development. Moreover, the most dynamic land use type that increased the most over the last four decades was urban area, which increased by six times from 0.37 to 2.  | References: ","KlocationStrata = 0.8267 and Kstandard = 0.7978, respectively.

However, collection of high-quality training data, which is necessary for accurate land cover mapping, remains costly and labor-intensive. To address this need, we created a global database of nearly 2 million training units spanning the period from 1984 to 2020 for seven primary and nine secondary land cover classes. Our training data collection approach leveraged GEE and machine learning algorithms to ensure data quality and biogeographic representation. We sampled the spectral-temporal feature space from Landsat imagery to efficiently allocate training data across global ecoregions and incorporated publicly available and collaborator-provided datasets to our database. To reflect the underlying regional class distribution and post-disturbance landscapes, we strategically augmented the database. We used a machine learning-based cross-validation procedure to remove potentially mis-labeled training units. Our training database is relevant for a wide array of studies such as land cover change, agriculture, forestry, hydrology, urban development, among many others.","Background & Summary: The accuracy of land cover and land cover change maps derived from remote sensing data depends on training sample size and quality -two key considerations in planning and conducting supervised classification 
As the global impact of climate change and anthropogenic activity has increased in recent decades, so has the need for high-quality maps of global land cover and land cover change. These maps require comprehensive, global, and high-quality land cover training datasets that are adaptable to the needs of a wide range of end users depending on the region of interest and the classification algorithm used. Currently, only a handful of continental-to-global training 
The goal of the Global Land Cover Estimation (GLanCE) project is to provide high-quality long-term records of land cover and land cover change at 30 m spatial resolution for the 21st century using the Landsat archive 
Our training data collection and curation approach leverages relatively recent technological advances such as cloud computing (e.g., Google Earth Engine (GEE)) and machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, k-means clustering etc.) to enforce data quality and ecological representation. Specifically, we implement an iterative quality assessment procedure that relies on expert review and a machine learning-based cross-validation procedure to remove poorly labeled training data.
Given the global scope of GLanCE, combined with the time and resource-intensive nature of training data collection, it was necessary to supplement the GLanCE data collection with external datasets and map products. Specifically, we harmonized seven publicly available land cover training datasets to be consistent with GLanCE data and combined them into a global database 
The objective of this paper is to describe the GLanCE training dataset, which is available to the public for use in regional-to-global land cover and land cover change studies. The dataset is global, medium spatial resolution (30 m), designed to be geographically and spectrally representative of all global ecoregions  | Methods training data collection.: GLanCE training data were collected by a team of trained image analysts at Boston University using the land cover key and a suite of online tools (https://github.com/parevalo/measures_collector, using Google Earth Engine API). Image analysts interpreted land cover on-screen using a combination of high-resolution Google Earth imagery, Landsat imagery, time series of spectral reflectance, vegetation indices, and Landsat-derived Tasseled Cap transformations. In addition, image analysts used Google Earth photos and StreetView (where available) to aid their interpretations. Hereafter we refer to each entry in the database, which represents individual Landsat pixels, as a training unit. Each training unit corresponds to an interpretation by an image analyst of Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) (https://developers.google.com/ earth-engine/datasets/catalog/GOOGLE_GLOBAL_CCDC_V1) time segments (explained below) (Fig. 
Over the course of data collection, the team of image analysts consisted of 6 to 12 members who were trained to interpret satellite imagery for land cover attributes. Analysts alternated between interpreting sets of randomly assigned training units and reviewing peers' interpretations. All image analysts received the same training to ensure consistency in their interpretation, followed by a practice training set for each continent that was collectively discussed so that analysts learned from their errors and followed consistent interpretation protocols. Training included image interpretation, guidance on how to use software tools that were developed to support this activity 
Because a single Landsat pixel can include multiple land cover types over time, an important component of our training data collection protocol was the interpretation of land cover change. The core algorithm used in this project, the CCDC algorithm  | Data collected by the: The second set of training data that image analysts collected was based on unsupervised clustering of spectral-temporal features estimated from Landsat image time series using the CCDC algorithm. This approach was stratified using the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) ecoregions 
Our cluster-based approach included two main steps: (1) principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data; and (2) k-means clustering on the principal components (PCs) to identify the optimal partitioning of the training data. For each ecoregion, we selected a maximum of 10 PCs to capture at least 80% of the variance, although 99% of the variance was frequently captured in fewer PCs. We ran k-means clustering for a range of K values from 5 to 400 and for each value we calculated the sum of squared distances from each point to its assigned center to select the optimal (fewest) number of clusters that were well separated from one another. As a result, we selected 30 to 60 clusters -for a maximum of 500 training units -per ecoregion. The resulting dataset was representative of the distribution of land cover at the regional scale and included a mix of homogeneous and heterogeneous training units. Because the STEP-and cluster-based datasets were collected explicitly for the purposes of the GLanCE project, together they represent the most thematically detailed and complete data in our database, with up to 23 recorded attributes per training unit.
The third set of training data were generated to iteratively improve the accuracy of land cover maps. Despite our best efforts to represent all ecoregions in the training data, examples of some specialized and regionally relevant land uses (e.g., greenhouses in Spain and China, sparse orchards, and plantations in India etc.) were missing in our training database, which resulted in obvious errors in the map results. To ameliorate these issues, we collected ""Feedback"" training units for these locations around the globe using the interpretation tools described above. | Supplementary data sources.: Given the global scale of the GLanCE project and the lack of available high-resolution imagery in some parts of the world, the GLanCE-collected dataset described above was insufficient to capture the full range of geographic, temporal, and spectral heterogeneity in global land cover. To address this, we supplemented the GLanCE training database by leveraging existing publicly available, collaborator-contributed, and team-collected datasets that we harmonized and standardized to conform to the GLanCE land cover classification key. The sources and key features of these data are summarized in Table 
Unfortunately, even after the data collected by the GLanCE team were combined with the supplementary datasets described above, some land cover classes, especially rarer classes (e.g., developed, water, shrub), were underrepresented. To address this, we augmented the database with training data derived from the World Settlement Footprint product 
Pre-processing and harmonization of supplementary data sources. Pre-processing and harmonization of supplementary datasets consisted of four steps: (1) if available, each dataset was filtered based on interpreter confidence (highest) or consensus score (100% agreement among interpreters); (2) the land cover legend for each data set was harmonized with the GLanCE legend (crosswalk tables in Supplementary Information);
(3) each dataset was compared against an existing land cover product (ESA World Cover  | Data Records: The GLanCE training dataset described in this paper is available from Source Cooperative 
Because land cover is dynamic and can change due to natural or anthropogenic processes, GLanCE training units are characterized as either 'stable' or 'transitional' (Segment_Type in Table

To our knowledge, the dataset presented in this study is the longest, most extensive, and comprehensive publicly available global land cover and land use training database. We standardized and harmonized 22 disparate sources of land cover labels into a single unified training database that is comprised of 39% publicly available data, 55% collaborator-provided data, 4% GLanCE-collected data (collected explicitly for the purposes of the GLanCE product), 1% Boston University team collected data (collected by team members for other projects, not explicitly for the purposes of GLanCE), and 0.2% MODIS-derived training data (Table  | technical Validation: Human error is inherent to all land cover training data sets, especially those compiled by on-screen interpretation 
We then examined the difference between the 1st and 2nd most likely classes; training data with margins less than 0.05 were discarded because they represented cases where the two most likely classes were easily confused. To select this threshold, we performed a 10-fold cross validation analysis, which demonstrated that training cases with margins less than or equal to 0.05 had substantially higher misclassification rates relative to cases with higher margins. We then removed all misclassified cases for which the margin between the predicted label and the label assigned to the unit in the database was in the upper quartile of margins for each class. In other words, we removed data where the assigned label differed from the label predicted by random forest, and where the class probability for the label assigned by random forest was high.
Using this procedure, we removed ~15% of the training data in each continent (Fig. 
As an additional technical validation, we followed an approach used by Doda et al. 
Tables S2-S7 show the confusion matrices between the observed and predicted land cover labels. Even though the user's accuracy is high (greater than 0.8 in most continents) (Fig.  | Usage Notes: Because the process of acquiring supplementary datasets was opportunistic and non-systematic based on data availability and quality, the full database includes geographic variation in data density. For example, some regions have training units that are geographically clumped (e.g., Ghana) or land cover classes that are overrepresented (e.g., herbaceous) (Figs. 
For applications focused on land cover change (abrupt or gradual), for which our database includes proportionally less data, we recommend retaining all change training data (for guidance see

They provide multiple ecosystem services, such as carbon capture and sequestration, food supply, and climate regulation. Studying land use and land cover change makes it possible to understand the land's alterations associated with deforestation, degradation, erosion, soil desertification, and biodiversity loss. The objective of this study is to evaluate the different approaches to land use and land cover research in tropical forests based on the evolutionary and qualitative analysis of the last 44 years of scientific production. The data were collected using the Scopus database and was based on the PRISMA methodology's four phases: (i) identification, (ii) screening, (iii) eligibility, and (iv) included. The results showed a significant increase in the study of land use and land cover consolidated in 4557 articles, with contributions from 74 countries, revealing 14 themes and seven lines of research. Core research areas such as biodiversity, land use, and conservation exist due to the ongoing interest in the value of tropical forests and their response to climate change. The present research allowed us to consider future study topics such as the relationship between sustainable development goals and land use and cover in tropical forests, as well as the evaluation of the environmental impact of economic activities in forests.","Introduction: Tropical forests differentiate between neotropical (New World) and paleotropical (Old World) 
Tropical forests are classified according to their elevation, annual rainfall, and degree of seasonality. They fall into four main types: ever-humid, semi-green, dry, and montane deciduous forests 
The Amazon houses approximately 30% of the world's tropical forests 
Tropical forests play a vital role in the conservation of biodiversity, climate change, and the regulation of the water cycle in the region 
Land use and land cover (LULC) changes directly or indirectly transform the quality of the tropical forests and the resources they provide 
Land use and land cover is commonly used to describe the Earth's surface coverage 
LULC studies can help manage natural resources sustainably 
Forests 2022, 13, 1709 3 of 34 sustainable practices for the development of agriculture 
Tropical forests have been the subject of studies regarding LULC due to their ecological, economic, and social importance. In these studies, various areas are analyzed; some focus on the relationship between LULC and climate change and its effects on the environment 
The constant growth of published information in the form of academic texts requires knowledge of the tools to measure the performance of the literature 
Over time, various studies on land cover and land use change in tropical regions have taken place, but only a few show this area's growth through bibliometric analyses. Among those studies, there is the study of the causes and effects of fires in tropical forests 
This study has five sections: the first section, or introduction, discusses the importance of tropical forest land use change, as well as the objective of the study; the second section contains materials and methods that show the database used, as well as the data search and processing; the third section includes results, detailing the main findings and their analysis; the fourth section focuses on the discussion, where the implications of the results are analyzed; and the fifth section includes the conclusions and limitations of the study. | Materials and Methods:  | Study Area: The study area comprises tropical forests located between the Tropics of Cancer (23.44 ‚Ä¢ N) and Capricorn (23.44 ‚Ä¢ S) (https://pb463.users.earthengine.app/view/fipnee202 0, accessed on 5 August 2022)  | Methods: Data Processing: Academic literature can be analyzed and explored through systematic and bibliometric analyses. The systematic approach includes rigorous techniques to make the data collection procedure transparent and easily replicated, thus reducing the bias in the information obtained 
Bibliometric analysis can effectively describe a discipline's state of knowledge, characteristics, and trends 
Based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology (Figure 
Based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology (Figure  | Stage I: Basis Query: This research aims to evaluate the land cover and land use changes in tropical forests worldwide through the bibliometric analysis of scientific publications. The search terms used are related to land use 
Based on the above, the defined criteria aim to answer the following research questions (RQ): | ‚Ä¢: RQ1: What are the scientific production trends regarding LULC in tropical forests? ‚Ä¢ RQ2: What are the most relevant publications and the countries that contributed to the growth of this field of study?  | Stage I: Basis Query: This research aims to evaluate the land cover and land use changes in tropical forests worldwide through the bibliometric analysis of scientific publications. The search terms used are related to land use 
Based on the above, the defined criteria aim to answer the following research questions (RQ):  The data collection occurred exclusively using the Scopus database, with a defined period from 1978 to 2021. The year 1978 was selected because it was when the first articles appeared in the database and the year 2022 was excluded, given that it is in progress at the time of this research. | Stage II: Data Search and Collection: Bibliometric studies generally need appropriate databases with complete and reliable information 
The article sample analyzed in this study was selected based on a search carried out in February 2022 in the Scopus database using the topic search: TS = ((TITLE-ABS-KEY (""land use"") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (""land cover"") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (""land use change""))) AND ((TITLE-ABS-KEY (""amazon*"") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (""rain forest*"") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (""tropical forest*""))) AND (EXCLUDE (PUBYEAR, 2022)). The search obtained a total of 5557 documents.
Documents that went through a general review process, such as editorials, books, and conference papers, were excluded  | Stage III Software and Data Selection: Once collected, the data from the Scopus database were exported to both a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and a text document for its respective treatment 
The Microsoft Excel Office 365 MSO software (Version 2209) performed the descriptive statistical analyses of the studied variables 
The bibliometric maps were built with the VOSviewer tool to visually present the statistical results related to the distribution of authors, institutes, countries/territories, and keywords  | Stage IV Data Interpretation: During the collected data analysis, two bibliometric approaches were used. The first bibliometric approach focuses on the performance of scientific production. The second bibliometric approach involves studying its intellectual structure through bibliometric mapping 
Performance analysis evaluates the impact of the scientific publications that make up this structure by contrasting information related to the number and year of publications, authors, affiliations, and journals  | Results:  | Performance Analysis:  | Scientific Production Analysis (RQ1): The scientific production of LULC in tropical forests comprises 4557 documents and 206,083 citations over  | Period I (1978-1989): The first twelve years show the beginning of scientific production within the prescribed period of study. In this period, there are 65 publications (1.43% of the documents) that add up to 2942 (1.43%) citations. Before the 1980s (1978 and 1979), articles were published on the causes and consequences of rotational cultivation and population pressure in tropical areas

Historically, it is a consolidation period for environmental research, mainly due to online information, storage platforms, and their public availability for consultation. The ""US Geological Survey"" [166] site is highlighted during this time because it facilitated an expressive set of information involving the Earth's surface mapping. That data will become a part of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s EarthData

In this phase, the Google Earth system was widely used, popularizing the use of geographic information systems in people's daily lives, through the historical analysis of images, providing a quick view of the changes in vegetation cover and the effects of deforestation. Continuing with the Google platform, the Google Engine tool makes the processing of digital images and land cover change analysis independent from commercial programs. In addition, it marks the current advancement in geotechnologies, including drone imaging, which generates high spatial resolution imagery applicable to environmental surveillance and enforcement.

Regarding environmental sciences, this bibliometric research adds a new perspective to the current forest situation by identifying the countries that contribute the most to LULC studies. At the same time, the management, conservation, and implementation of public policies that help control environmental problems such as global warming, deforestation, and forest degradation are increasingly crucial for researchers, world leaders, and organizations. For this reason, a bibliometric analysis can serve as a starting point to determine the topics of most significant interest in this field of study.
Tropical forests play an important ecological, social, and economic role. In addition to having rich biodiversity, they are home to multiple human communities and providers of various ecosystem services 
On the other hand, Brazil has a considerable extension of tropical forests. Their participation is important due to their interest in Amazon conservation, which represents approximately 60% of the Brazilian territory 
The importance and conservation of tropical forests and their carbon reserves and emissions belong to topics analyzed through satellite images. These images also facilitate the exploration of different land uses, land cover, and the carbon balance 
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) established in 2015 would also benefit the development and conservation of tropical forests. Several researchers analyzed the relationship of LULC with the SDGs in these ecosystems. These studies include public policy proposals to allow the sustainable management of tropical forests, coverage mapping 
Remote sensing has been a tool used since the beginning of LULC research in tropical forests. Since 1972, Landsat satellite data has made it possible to analyze changes in global coverage, such as deforestation and the expansion of agricultural and urban areas. Starting in 2008, corrections were made regarding the errors presented in the datasets to improve their coverage 
Despite continuous advances in LULC research techniques in tropical forests, forest degradation retains various unknows in many human impact analyses 
The three bibliometric maps and intellectual structure analyses allowed us to analyze the relationships between the different topics and schools of thought: | ‚Ä¢: First, the keyword co-occurrence analysis made it possible to analyze the most prominent themes (Figure  | ‚Ä¢: The author co-citation analysis reveals the interconnections between different authors (Figure 
This research facilitates the analysis of the interrelationships between researchers, countries, and schools of thought where the different areas of LULC in tropical forests are studied. The development of this theme aims at the continuous understanding of the LULC impacts using newer mathematical, computer, and technological models, satellite missions 
An integrated analysis indicates that the scientific research on tropical forests has a greater focus on the Amazon region, which may be related to the fact that this area represents the largest tropical forest in the world, as well as to its fundamental role in conservation and in the fight against climate change. It also concerns land use and land cover alterations, which South American institutions and other countries are widely investigating, particularly in the United States and Europe. There is an inequality between Brazil and the other Amazonian countries regarding scientific production, since the Andean countries have a much lower percentage of research. This inequality creates a differentiated understanding of Amazonian problems and decreases the use of these studies in the development of public policies to control deforestation throughout the region.
Another important region for tropical forest assessment is Africa, where research production is reduced. The United States appears as a producer of knowledge about other areas of the planet, which reflects its dominance of information storage platforms, which have made satellite and radar images of the Earth accessible to the public, becoming a global generator of geospatial information. This situation implies that many countries with no surveillance systems use these external databases as the primary source of information, thus generating a direct intervention in their geopolitics.
Finally, although LULC research in tropical forests is not recent, and its growth in the last decade has been prominent, it is necessary to consider what other topics within the area could be analyzed. The following are some gaps in the research that future studies could address:
1.
Studies linking compliance with SDGs concerning LULC in tropical forests are required. Few studies address this issue, and the ones that do focus mainly on how deforestation and degradation monitoring can be used to manage these objectives. | 2.: Studies of specific activities such as oil exploitation and mining focus solely on the effects on human health, and there are few publications on its impact on the environment. | 3.: LULC studies in the Andean-Amazonian region should be expanded. A large part of the analyses use optical satellite images, where the presence of cloud cover is a problem that limits the generation of maps regarding land use and land coverage in these regions.
This study has some limitations, such as i) the exclusive consideration of scientific articles in English, and ii) the fact that the data analysis was limited to data from the Scopus database. As a result, the present study may have ignored some contributions in this field. Subsequent studies could consider these limitations to broaden the subject of study. | Conclusions: This study demonstrates that in the last four decades, there has been an increase in the scientific production of tropical forests' LULC due to the collaboration of 74 countries. The intellectual structure in this field of study records collaborations of greater scientific production concerning (i) researchers: Shimabukuro Yosie and Barlow Jos; (ii) countries: the United States and Brazil; and (iii) journals: Forest Ecology and Management and PLOS One, as well as the collaborations with the highest number of citations: (i) author: Eric Davidson; (ii) country: the United States; and (iii) journal: Science.
The different approaches associated with LULC tend to focus on research topics related to the analysis of multiple anthropogenic activities that cause forest degradation and changes in their ecological dynamics. In addition, a growing interest in conserving these ecosystems due to their high biological, economic, and social value is revealed. The use and evolution of different technological tools that allow a multi-temporal analysis of the dynamics and structure of tropical forests were also evidenced.
This research serves as a contribution to future studies that explore the areas of knowledge focused on LULC in tropical forests because (i) it facilitates access to information on the most studied topics and the most representative authors, (ii) it guides researchers to form networks of collaboration when developing projects according to their area of study, (iii) it is a management tool for researchers to understand, in a general way, the intellectual structure of the area, and (iv) it is a complement for the identification of tendencies in the area that allow the generation of knowledge in favor of the sustainable management of forests.","Tropical Forest Ecosystems (, 2013) || Increasing Turnover Through Time in Tropical Forests (, , 1994) || Rainforest Ecosystems, Animal Diversity (, 2013) || Biogeographical and Taxonomic Biases in Tropical Forest Fragmentation Research (, , , 2014) || Soil Biogeochemical Responses of a Tropical Forest to Warming and Hurricane Disturbance (, , , , , , 2020) || Replacing Rubber Plantations by Rain Forest in Southwest China-Who Would Gain and How Much?

"Land-Use and Land-Cover Changes in Dong Trieu District, Vietnam, during Past Two Decades and Their Driving Forces",Thi-Thu Vu; Yuan Shen,"Land-use and land-cover (LULC) change analyses are useful in understanding the changes in our living environments and their driving factors. Modeling changes of LULC in the future, together with the driving factors derived through analyzing the trends of past LULC changes, bring the opportunity to assess and orientate the current and future land-use policies. As the entryway of Quang Ninh province, Vietnam, Dong Trieu locale has experienced significant LULC changes during the past two decades. In this study, the spatial distribution of six Level I LULC classes, forest, cropland, orchards, waterbody, built-up, and barren land, in Dong Trieu district at 2000, 2010, and 2019 were obtained from Landsat imageries by maximum likelihood technique. The most significant changes observed over the past twenty years are a decrease of barren land (9.1%) and increases of built-up (8.1%) and orchards (6.8%). Driving factor analysis indicated that the changes of cropland and built-up were dependent on distance from road (DFR), distance from main road (DFMR), distance from urban (DFU), distance from water (DFW), elevation, slope, and population density. The changes of forest were dependent on all the driving forces listed above, except DFMR. The orchards mainly appeared near the high-population-density area. The transformation of the waterbody was affected by geography (elevation and slope) and population density. The higher the population density, the less barren the land would appear.","Introduction: In 2018, 55% of the total world populace lived in metropolitan areas. Projections show that urbanization, with the increasing trend of the total populace, could add another 2.5 billion individuals to metropolitan territories by 2050, with nearly 90% of this increment occurring in Asia and Africa

Dong Trieu district, Vietnam, experienced a radical LULC change due to population expansion, economic growth, and changes in the agriculture cultivation system over the past 20 years. However, the driving factors of LULC have not been studied. Therefore, the aims of this study were  | Methodology: This study was divided into two parts, as shown in Figure  | Study Area: Dong Trieu district, as the entryway of Quang Ninh province, is located in the northeast region of Vietnam, between 21¬∞29‚Ä≤04"" and 21¬∞44‚Ä≤55"" North latitude, and 106¬∞33‚Ä≤ and 106¬∞44‚Ä≤57"" East longitude (Figure  | Satellite Data: To monitor the land-use and land-cover changes, cloud-free scenes of Landsat Thematic Mapper-TM  | Satellite Data: To monitor the land-use and land-cover changes, cloud-free scenes of Landsat Thematic Mapper-TM 
The change detection and map production were conducted by ArcGIS (Ver 10.5, ArcGIS, ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA).  | Land Use/Land Cover Classification: The maximum likelihood classifier was employed for LULC classification in this study. For 2000 and 2019, existing LULC maps, Google Earth imagery, and information collected from interviews with local experts were used to select specific training sites. The sample separability ranged from 1.8 to 2.0, measured by using the transformed divergence distance. Six LULC Level I classes, namely forest, cropland, orchard, waterbody, built-up, and barren land, were classified (Table  | Accuracy Assessment: The classification accuracy of all three images (2000, 2010, and 2019) in the study was assessed by an error matrix using Google Earth and Land use maps from Dong Trieu Division of Natural Resources and Environment (DONRE). The true agreement from this validation is measured by the Kappa coefficient. The Kappa coefficient is broadly utilized in LULC accuracy assessment to compute the true agreement between the observed agreement and chance agreement 
where x ii is the diagonal components in the error matrix, and x is the total samples in the error matrix. The kappa coefficient reflects the difference between actual agreement and the agreement expected by chance:
where r is the number of rows; x ii is the observations at row i and column i; x i+ and x +i are the sum of row i and column i, respectively; and n is the number of observations. | Driving Forces: Driving forces are natural or socioeconomic phenomena causing land-use change. Limited by data availability, only seven spatial variables commonly used [14,  | Cramer's V Coefficients Evaluation: The correlations between the driving factors of LULC change were assessed by the Cramer's V Coefficient (CVC) or Cramer's V strategies 
where œï is the coefficient of contingency, œá is derived from Pearson's chi-squared test, n represents the total of observations, k represents the number of columns, and r represents the number of rows in the LULC images. The CVC has a value between 0 and 1 (inclusive).
A value close to 1 demonstrates that a driving factor has a high possibility of being an explanatory variable. A high total CVC value (more than 0.15) represents that the expected illustrative worth of the variable is acceptable or helpful; a value under 0.15 can be dismissed  | Results and Discussions:  | Classification Accuracy Assessments: Accuracy assessments of the LULC classification in 2000, 2010, and 2019 are listed in Table 
Major causes that yielded incorrect classifications were as follows: (1) A cropland may be under a rotating system. It might be recognized as a barren land or waterbody when the land was left for recuperation. (2) A majority of the forests in the studied region were plantation forests. It might be recognized as orchards, cropland, or barren land when the planted trees were still at the initial growth stage. (3) The residential areas were often surrounded by orchards. This could lead to difficulty in distinguishing between built-up and orchards. (4) It was challenging to separate cropland and barren land accurately at certain locations, contingent upon the states of the crops and the season.  | Temporal Changes of LULC Classes: The statistics for the six LULC classes and their spatial distribution in 2000, 2010, and 2019 are represented in Table 
In 2019, the areal coverage of built-up increased to 19.5% and took second place in the ranking. The orchards also expanded dramatically with an increase of about 2800 ha, which was about 1.6 times that of 2010, and took third place with an areal coverage of 19.2%. However, the cropland, waterbody, and barren land decreased by 2.3%, 2.8%, and 3.7%, respectively, from that of 2010.
Therefore, the Dong Trieu district experienced various changes in LULC classes during the past two decades. Among all the changes of LULC classes, the rapid expansion of built-up and orchards and the dramatic decrease of barren land were the most significant changes in the Dong Trieu district. Therefore, the Dong Trieu district experienced various changes in LULC clas ing the past two decades. Among all the changes of LULC classes, the rapid expan built-up and orchards and the dramatic decrease of barren land were the most sig changes in the Dong Trieu district. | 21, 10, 798:  | Conversions among LULC Classes: Transformation matrices illustrating the conversions among LULC classes du studied period are shown in Table  | Conversions among LULC Classes: Transformation matrices illustrating the conversions among LULC classes during the studied period are shown in Table 
Orchards (e.g., dragon fruit, orange, and lychee) was the LULC class that developed most quickly and widely across the Dong Trieu district. From 2000 to 2010, a slight decrease in orchards area from 12.4% to 12.1% was found, but the area occupied by orchards increased nearly 7% in 2000-2019 (Table 
The areal percentage occupied by waterbody experienced a continuous decline of 8.6%, 8.5%, and 5.7% in 2000, 2010, and 2019, respectively (Table 
The areal percentages occupied by built-up in 2000, 2010, and 2019 were 11.5%, 14.4%, and 19.5%, respectively, and experienced a total increase of 3166.8 ha from 2000 to 2019 (Table 
The areal percentage occupied by barren land also experienced a continuous decline of 10.3%, 4.9%, and 1.2% in 2000, 2010, and 2019, respectively (Table  | Driving Forces for LULC Changes: The overall CVC values for each analyzed factor are listed in Table 
The CVCs of distance from water (DFW) for forest, waterbody, and cropland are 0.388, 0.230, and 0.216, respectively, which suggested that the water area in this study was often located far from the forest. The cropland, however, often occurred near the water areas, possibly due to easy water accessibility. The continuous decline of the waterbody area caused the conversion of cropland to orchards or forests, as shown in Table 
The CVCs of elevation showed a relatively strong relationship with forest (0.413), which indicated that the elevation has a good association with forest expansion. The distributions of built-up and cropland were less strongly affected by elevation, as indicated by their CVC values of 0.230 and 0.204, respectively.
The CVCs of slope for forest, cropland, and built-up were 0.608, 0.326, and 0.266, respectively. Thus, slope appeared to be a good predictor of forest, cropland, and builtup. It is noted that the studied region has quite a large variation in topography and socioeconomic complexity, so that elevation and slope have large overall CVCs. Similar correlations between forest expansion topographic factors have been observed in Northwestern Vietnam 
The population density had the highest overall CVC value among all analyzed factors and high CVC values for forest, cropland, and built-up, at 0.556, 0.447, and 0.384, respectively. Not surprisingly, deforestation is more substantial at places closer to an existing area of higher population density. Furthermore, the locations closer to a high population density area have higher probabilities of conversion to built-up. These results showed that population pressure played an important role in increasing built-up area and conversion of forest to other land-use classes. | Conclusions: The spatial distribution of LULC classes identified through Landsat imageries acquired in 2000, 2010, and 2019 revealed significant LULC changes in the Dong Trieu district during the past two decades. The area under barren land, waterbody, cropland, and forest revealed a declining trend from 2000 to 2019, with a net decrease of 3576.5, 1147.7, 749.5, and 357.2 ha, respectively. The area under built-up and orchards exhibited an overall growing trend during the same period, with a net increase of 3166.8 and 2644.2 ha, respectively. The expansion and built-up area and the decrease of cropland were driven by all seven factors analyzed, i.e., distance from road (DFR), distance from main road (DFMR), distance from urban (DFU), distance from water (DFW), elevation, slope, and population density. The changes of forest were dependent on all the driving forces listed above, except DFMR. Orchards were established close to urban or areas of high population density. The transformation of the waterbody was affected by geography (elevation and slope) and population density. The higher the population density, the less the barren land would appear.
According to the roles of active driving factors depicted by this study, land-use planners and decision-makers of the Dong Trieu district should introduce more environmentfriendly livelihood and measures, such as population-growth control to reduce the pressure on demanding more build-up area and conversion of forest to other land-use classes; better water-resources managements to reduce irrigation water shortage problems; encouragement of intensive use of agricultural lands and high-tech farming to increase yields and decrease the demand on more croplands; and encouragement of community participation in forest management to protect and expand the forest area, with intentions to promote sustainable development in the future.
The methodologies presented in this study show how to combine satellite data with other ancillary data (DEM and population density in this study) that are varying in format, accuracy, and spatial resolution than remotely sensed images to understand the actual driving factors for structural changes of LULC in a given area. This can be a powerful planning tool with many positive insights into the policy and governance of a specific territory. A simulation study based on the roles of the driving factors depicted is currently being undertaken to further examine the potential impacts of these variables on land-use changes in future scenarios."," (, June 2020) || Dynamics of land-use and land-cover change in tropical regions (, , , 2003) || Detecting forest canopy change due to insect activity using Landsat MSS (, 1983) || A Land Use and Land Cover Classification System for Use with Remote Sensor Data; US Government Printing Office (, 1976) || Review article digital change detection techniques using remotely-sensed data (, 1989) || The next Landsat satellite: The Landsat data continuity mission.

Changes in the land-use landscape pattern and ecological network of Xuzhou planning area,Xi Zhou; Zuoyong Chu; Xiang Ji,"Ongoing rapid urbanization has triggered significant changes in land use, rendering landscape patterns adversely impacted and certain habitat patches degraded. Ecological networks have consequently contracted overall. As such, an investigation into how land-use landscape patterns and ecological networks change over time and space is of major significance for ecological restoration and regional sustainability. Taking Xuzhou Planning Area as a case study, we examined spatiotemporal changes and features of the landscape pattern by employing the land-use change degree, the landuse transition matrix, and quantified landscape pattern indices. An ecological network analysis, which studies the changes in network connectivity and robustness, as well as their causes and contributors, was undertaken to probe into the features and trends of spatiotemporal changes in the land-use landscape pattern and ecological network amid expeditious urbanization. Analysis results unveiled the following: (1) From 1985 to 2020, there was a decline in the area of farmland, forest, and grassland, accompanied by an increase in land for construction, water bodies, and unused land. The southwestern research area witnessed farmland substantially give way to land for construction for this period, and the most dramatic change in land use occurred between 2000 and 2010. (2) The area of dominant patches in the research area shrank, along with more fragmented, complex landscapes. The land for construction was emerging as the dominant landscape by area, whereas patches of farmland, forest, grassland, and water bodies became less connected. (3) The ecological network was densely linked in the northeast, with sparser connections in the southwest. Spatial shrinkage was observed in the research area's southwestern and central ecological corridors. Overall, the number of ecological sources and corridors rose and subsequently dropped before a rebound. (4) The ecological network grew more connected and robust from 1985 through 1990, as portions of farmland were converted into water bodies, which led to an increase in ecological sources. Given a reduction in ecological sources and corridors in the southwestern and central regions between 1990 and 2010, network connectivity and robustness declined, which was reversed from 2010 onward with the addition of two ecological sources-Pan'an Lake and Dugong Lake. With an optimal ecological network in 1990, however, it deteriorated significantly by 2010. The research area saw the minimum value of its network connectivity indices of network stability index (Œ±), evenness index (Œ≤), and connectivity index (Œ≥), in 2010, when its ecological network was highly fragmented and vulnerable, attributing to a strong contrast between the maximal connected subgraph's relative size and connectivity robustness. The research findings can lay scientific groundwork for addressing ecological issues, restoring landscape patterns, and developing ecological networks amid urbanization.

Rapid urbanization takes a toll on land use and its resulting landscape pattern, which, in turn, holds back sustainable urban growth ","Untitled Section: Presently, a large majority of global research efforts on land use landscape patterns and ecological networks have been made from individual perspectives. On landscape patterns, prior studies focused on examining either the features of spatiotemporal changes concerning all types of the land use landscape through the dynamic degree of land use and land-use transition matrix, metrics derived from land use change 
Employing the Landsat program's remote sensing data spanning from 1985 to 2020, we endeavored to elucidate the trends and features of spatiotemporal changes in the landscape pattern and ecological network of the Xuzhou Planning Area. The effort was facilitated by analyzing land-use change and landscape pattern indices and applying ecological network research methods. Commencing with a rigorous exploration of land-use change, this study adopted quantitative measures, including the land-use change degree, the land-use transition matrix, and landscape pattern indices, to discern the intricate spatiotemporal changing trends and characteristics encompassing the urban landscape pattern. Subsequently, the MSPA-InVEST-Conefor model was harnessed to identify ecological sources, before developing an ecological network grounded on the MCR model and under circuit theory. Through the lens of network stability index (Œ±), evenness index (Œ≤), and connectivity index (Œ≥)  | Research area overview and data sources:  | Research area overview: Situated in the northwest of Jiangsu Province and the southeast of the North China Plain, Xuzhou represents a strategically significant city in the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative and a national innovation demonstration zone for sustainable development. Plains and hills account for about 90% and 10% of the city's total area, respectively. The hilly area's altitude ranges from 100 to 200 m, with the highest peak represented by Dadong Mountain nestled at the heart of Jiawang District, at 361 m. Home to a permanent population of 9.03 million, Xuzhou fosters a robust urbanization rate of 66.19%, and its GDP stood impressively at Renminbi 811.74 billion as of the end of 2021. Factoring in the city's overarching developmental imperatives and the spatial layout of its landscape pattern and ecological network, we took the Xuzhou Planning Area as our research area, which included downtown Xuzhou and Shuanggou Town in Suining County, as illustrated in Fig.  | Data sources and processing: The data sources utilized in this research are detailed in Table  | Research methods:  | Analysis of land-use change:  | Dynamic degree of land use: The dynamic degree of land use reflects the change in the area of land-use types and its intensity for a given time period of research

Over the period from 1985 to 2020, a discernible trend of farmland continuously giving way to urban land for construction was observed. Concurrently, farmland progressively diminished, predominantly converting into land for construction; both forest and grassland areas exhibited a declining trajectory, with conversions mainly directed toward farmland and land for construction; the water bodies expanded before contracted, typically reflecting transitions from and to farmland; the area of unused land experienced a consistent increase, chiefly    | Features of spatiotemporal changes in the landscape pattern: Landscape-oriented evaluation Variations in landscape-oriented landscape pattern indices in the Xuzhou Planning Area during the period from 1985 to 2020, as depicted in Table  | Patch-oriented evaluation: The variations in patch-based landscape pattern indices for the period 1985-2020 in Xuzhou Planning Area are illustrated in Fig.  | Features of spatiotemporal changes in land use:  | Area change and dynamic degree of land use: Based on the MSPA-InVEST analysis outcomes depicted in Figures

Research findings offer guidance for addressing the issue of urban eco-space shrinkage and fragmentation, better preserving ecological resources in the research area, and promoting sustainable urban development.
Major conclusions were drawn as follows:
(1) Xuzhou Planning Area has undergone a dramatic transformation in the land-use landscape pattern amid urbanization. Between 1985 and 2020, the continuous expansion of land for construction notably encroached upon surrounding farmland, resulting in the conversion of certain ecological land, including forests and grasslands, into construction areas. Over the 35-year period, there was a significant increase in the area of land for construction by 303.08 km The indices of SHDI and SHEI, however, increased throughout the research period, from 0.92 and 0.51 up to 1.02 and 0.57, respectively. These readings suggested that the dominant patch area in landscapes is on a declining trend, accompanied by enhanced ecological spatial heterogeneity and increased fragmentation and complexity of landscapes. At the patch level, the land for construction is steadily enhancing its role as the largest dominant landscape type, and the fragmented invasion of land for construction in the suburbs of cities has caused a reduction and fragmentation of farmland, posing a threat to the quality of habitats and landscape layout such as forests, grasslands, and water bodies.This trend leads to loosely connected patches of these land types. (3) The overall ecological network in the research area grew dense in the northeast and sparse in the southwest characterized by intense human activity. Between 1985 and 2020, the number of ecological sources and corridors rose and subsequently dropped before a rebound. The total area of ecological sources decreased by 8.06 km 2 , despite an increase in number, from 19 to 20. At the same time, the number of corridors rose from 47 to 49, but despite this increase, the combined length was shortened by 120.23 km. Landscapes became better connected for the period from 1985 to 1990, with potions of farmland converted into water areas and an addition of three ecological sources and eight corridors. With an expansion of land for construction in the southwest during the period from 1990 to 2010, the overall number of ecological patches became smaller, thus compromising landscape connectivity and disrupting the ecological landscape pattern. From 2010 onward, landscape connectivity was enhanced as attention was paid to restoring ecosystems, together with a conversion of some farmland portions into water areas and the addition of two ecological sources and seven corridors. On the whole, the northeastern region with dense forest patches had stronger landscape connectivity. The strength of landscape connectivity was correlated with changes in ecological sources, as the expansion of land for construction led to a shrinkage of ecological source areas and corridors in the densely populated southwest, which was unfavorable for material and information exchange and biodiversity conservation in the research area. (4) Over the period from 1985 to 1990, three ecological sources and eight corridors were added, enhancing the connectivity of ecological patches and complicating the ecological network. However, between 1990 and 2010, the spatial distribution of corridors in the southwestern and central research area shrank, resulting in a decline in network connectivity and robustness. Starting from 2010, the addition of two ecological sources, namely Dugong Lake and Pan'an Lake, increased the density of corridors in the central and northeastern research area, thus changing network connectivity and robustness for the better. Overall, the ecological network was most optimal in 1990, with a more even spatial distribution between its source areas, better ensuring the resilience of the ecological network to external disruptions. Followed by 2000, 2020, 1985, and 2010. By 2010, the maximal connected subgraph's relative size and connectivity robustness exhibited significant fluctuations and differences. And the Œ±, Œ≤, and Œ≥ indices hit their minimum values of 0.81, 2.33, and 0.875, respectively, indicating that during this period, the period witnessed the most fragmented ecological network, characterized by heightened vulnerability upon disruptions. | Discussions: In this paper, we delved into land-use landscape patterns changes and transitions in the Xuzhou Planning Area spanning from 1985 through 2020 and produced an ecological network of the research area. Subsequently, we conducted a thorough assessment of network connectivity and resilience, examining the dynamic evolution attributes of the ecological network structure through a prolonged temporal lens and identifying key recovery zones within the landscape schema. Analysis results showed that there were pronounced differences between southwestern and northeastern research regions in terms of the number of ecological corridors and nodes.
Another observation was that the ecological network in the northeastern Jiawang District was denser than that in the southwestern research area characterized by intense human activity. This was attributed to the continuous expansion of land for construction in the central urban areas of the southwestern region, with fragmentation encroaching on surrounding farmland and core ecological patches of forest, grassland, and water bodies.
Consequently, this has resulted in the contraction of ecological patches and corridors in the southwestern area, propelling the overall landscape towards a trajectory of increased fragmentation and complexity. The inadequate connectivity among patches impedes the exchange of substrates, information, and biodiversity conservation within the study domain. Authorities should avoid allowing uncontrolled construction in these areas if they are to meet the national goal of maintaining habitat connectivity and fostering sustainable urban-rural development. There should be a focus on amplifying ecological restoration and protection initiatives in the southwestern region, rigorously controlling the unplanned expansion and sprawl of construction land, while also intensifying efforts to conserve and connect farmland and core ecological patches of forest, grassland, and water bodies. This includes the establishment of ecological corridors amidst patches, thereby enhancing ecosystem stability and bolstering landscape integration. Nonetheless, certain limitations in this paper warrant consideration. First, different topographic and geomorphic features in the research area were not factored in during the creation of the complex network, which impeded a further exploration of the interplay between network robustness with ecological nodes under attack and the impact of natural elements in the research area. Second, the processes of extracting ecological sources and weighting ecological resistance factors were primarily drawn from prior research and findings, which entails a qualitative analysis framework. For now, a comprehensive and unified quantitative analytical paradigm for research on ecological networks remains absent. Overcoming these limitations would be instrumental in further complementing the research literature on the structures and features of spatial ecological networks.","(1234567890) Scientific Reports |

"Mapping Land Use Land Cover Changes and Their Determinants in the Context of a Massive Free Labour Mobilisation Campaign: Evidence from South Wollo, Ethiopia",Bichaye Tesfaye; Monica Lengoiboni; Jaap Zevenbergen; Belay Simane,"Northern Ethiopia is characterised by fragile mountain eco-systems that are highly susceptible to land degradation, impacting food security and livelihoods. This study appraises Land Use Land Cover Changes (LULCC) and their determinants from 2000 to 2020 in Dessie Zuria and Kutaber Woredas. It explores the LULCC and the key anthropogenic drivers of the change over the past 20 years through a mix of satellite imagery and a survey of local understandings. Six land use types (agriculture, forest, area closure, grazing, settlement and bare land) were mapped from satellite imagery that was acquired from Landsat 7 for the years 2000, 2005, and 2010, and Landsat 8 and OLI multispectral imageries for the years 2015 and 2020 with a spectral resolution of 30-m obtained from USGS. The results showed that agricultural land increased from 29.68% in 2000 to 35.77% in 2020.Furthermore, settlement and grazing lands enlarged from 5.95% and 6.04%, respectively, to 8.31% and 6.35% during the same period, while bare land increased from 9.89% to 10.92% in 2020. On the contrary, forest and area closure decreased from 18.45% and 29.99% to 17.8% and 17.38%, respectively. Meanwhile, population growth, unrestricted grazing, losing a sense of ownership of protected area closures and forests, lack of cooperation, using the free labour mobilisation schemes for government-induced agendas, weak enforcement of laws and bylaws, and engaging farmers for extended days on the campaign were prominent determinants of the changes. This research has implications for development actors across land management and food security towards implementing sustainable land management in the area and beyond.","Introduction: The sustainability of natural resources has been seriously constrained by enormous land degradation in Ethiopia 
Land degradation in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is widespread. Sixty-five per cent of agricultural land is degraded due to wind and soil erosion, and 28% of the population lives in areas that are prone to land degradation. Specifically, 40% of the grassland, 26% of the forestland, and 12% of the cropland have severe land degradation 
Land degradation is negatively correlated with food security; Soil fertility decline and nutrient mining leads to reduced agricultural productivity and, thus, translate to food insecurity 
Cognisant of this, the Government of Ethiopia (GoE) and other development agencies have tried to halt the land degradation problem. Considerable resources have been mobilised to manage the farmlands' sustainability and promote agricultural productivity with improved natural resource-conserving technologies. In 1970, the World Food Program introduced a MERT (Managing Environmental Resources to Enable Transitions to a more Sustainable Livelihoods) program, which aims at controlling land degradation by rehabilitating ruined lands and improving productivity 
Investigating LULCC are essential components in current strategies for managing natural resources and monitoring environmental changes 
The principal action employed by the GoE and the community to revitalise the natural resource basis of each watershed is through a free labour mobilisation campaign, which involves mobilising and organising all capable farmers for 30-60 days in the watershed activities during the off-farm months of the year. The campaign took place for the last two decades, most specifically in areas assumed as degradation prone and resource-poor. Despite the program's widespread implementation, the contribution of these campaigns to bring anticipated LULCC has not yet been studied and documented 
The paper is composed of five parts. After this introduction, sections two, three, four and five will discuss methods, results, discussion, and conclusion and future work. | Materials and Methods:  | Description of the Study Area: Encompassing a 17,067.45 km 2 area, South Wello is one of the ten zones (administrative tier of government below the regional state and above Woreda) in the Amhara National Regional State (ANRS). The zone lies around 11 ‚Ä¢ 8 N and 39 ‚Ä¢ 38 E (Figure

Several factors influence the selection of an appropriate classifier. These include the accuracy of the topographic map, the rate and scale of human intervention, time required to train the classifier, and the classifier's complexity 
Both unsupervised and supervised image classification approaches were used. The unsupervised classification was performed before the field survey, whereas the supervised image classification was computed after the training sample was collected in the field survey. After assigning the signature value (training area) in the supervised image classifications, a spatial merging approach was used to achieve a more homogenous appearance of the individual classes. This approach is used to merge neighbouring regions based on their spatial features 
Based on the information obtained and the procedures followed, the study adopted a classification scheme consisting of six land-use types (agricultural land, forests, area closure, grazing land, settlement, and bare land) (Table  | Land-Use Type Description: Agricultural land
Areas of land ploughed/prepared for the growing of rain-fed crops. This includes areas currently under crop and fallow, as well as land under preparation    | Change Detection: It is critical to investigate changes in land use/land cover to take appropriate management action. In remote sensing, change detection is used to examine the differences in an object's status utilising multi-temporal spatial data sets. The premise behind satellite imagery is to detect changes in land use, and the land cover reflects themselves as variances in spectral brightness  | Results:  | Accuracy Assessment: Satellite imagery was acquired from Landsat 7 for 2000, 2005, and 2010 and from Landsat 8 for 2015 and 2020. OLI multispectral imageries used with a spectral resolution of 30-m were acquired from USGS (Table  | Change Matrix: The Change Matrix denotes a shift in area coverage. The Change Matrix indicates a change in area coverage measured by hectares and percentage for the five periods, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020, indicated below (Table

The study revealed considerable LULC changes during 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020 reference years. The satellite imagery result indicates increasing and decreasing changes in each of the six land-use types (Figure 
The research revealed that the increments in this land-use resulted at the expense of other land uses, like forests, area closures, and grazing lands. Correspondingly, an area under settlement has shown a rise at a different degree in the four-period intervals. It increased from 9773.6 ha or 5.95% in 2000 to 10,586.61 ha or 6.4% in 2020. Bare land, which accounts for 9.89% of the total area, increased to 10.92 per cent in 2020. Changes between periods were calculated using the following formula  | Percentage of LULCC =: Area final year -Area initial year Area initial year Nevertheless, other land uses, for instance, forest and area closure, decreased from 18.45% and 29.99% to17.8% and 17.38%. The satellite imagery data revealed a change in LULC between 2000 and 2020. Specifically, settlement, agriculture and grazing land have increased by 32 %, 16.51% and 19.97%. Contrary to this, forest and area closure decreased by 30 % and 19.73 %. Though insignificant, bare land has increased by 1.36 % (Table  | LULCC and Free Labour Mobilisation Campaign: The GoE was keen to rehabilitate degraded lands through a variety of mechanisms. The MERT program and the preceding ""food for work and cash for work"" were among the interventions in this regard. Due to concerns around sustainability and other related matters, the GoE came with a unique approach called the free labour mobilisation campaign. The campaign takes place annually, where farmers are assumed to be free from any onfarm activities (Figure 
ters, the GoE came with a unique approach called the free labour mobilisation campaign. The campaign takes place annually, where farmers are assumed to be free from any onfarm activities (Figure  | Drivers of Lulcc: Many factors are seen as responsible for the prevailing LULCC between 2000-2020. High population growth and the intention of young people to intrude and farm both forest and area closures are among the significant threats raised during respective discussions. Furthermore, high population growth, which increases at the rate of 2.9% 
Emerging jobless youth and the shrinkage of farmland because of land degradation and sharing among family members have increased agricultural density from 154.84/km 2 in 2000 to 183.3/km 2 in 2020 (Figure 
Similarly, the study Woredas were found to have the highest livestock population. The finding of this research indicates the existence of a high TLU per the studied households. As indicated in Table 
Similarly, the study Woredas were found to have the highest livestock population. The finding of this research indicates the existence of a high TLU per the studied households. As indicated in Table  | Livestock holding in TLU: 3.63 3.1 2.74 3.07 3.14 3.06
A large TLU, coupled with free grazing management, has caused a significant burden on area closures and forest schemes. Data obtained from qualitative and quantitative sources reveal that free grazing is one of the main problems for the poor expansion of these schemes (Figure 
Individual household heads were interviewed using household questionnaires to reflect their views regarding the significant determinants of LULCC in their area. The percentages and rank were derived based on how the respondents selected the variables using the Likert scale. Based on what has been raised in different sessions and the information obtained from reports and pieces of literature, a household survey was undertaken to investigate the problem of free labour mobilisation. Ten constraints were identified and deliberately included in the questioner to obtain the respondents' responses based on the Likert scale. Of the 402 respondents, 223 believe that the campaign had passed with many problems in the last two decades. However, the remaining 179 households believed that the campaign had no problem.
The finding of the household survey identified six critical problems of the campaign: losing a sense of ownership; the intention of farmers to start the campaign first from their vicinity; shortage of seeds, seedlings, and cuttings; absence of solid laws and bylaws; lack of cooperation; and using the labour campaign for other political agendas. The shortage of farm tools, poor representation of women and the risk of rodent infestations were put under a lesser priority scenario (Table  | Discussion: It is inevitable to observe LULCC occurring in non-linear form due to complex and interweaved anthropogenic and natural processes. Transformation of land is a trend that will continue to unfold, as most of the intervention was raised from the very egocentric nature of human beings and their descendants 
The multi-temporal satellite imagery and other qualitative methods reveal that the study area has undergone prominent LULCC. Between 2000 and 2020, agricultural land and settlement increased at the expense of area closures and forests. In research done in the same basin, the same was found by 
In addition to this, the practice of free grazing and having much livestock per household remains a problem for the development of forest and area closures. Unquestionably, livestock plays a pivotal contribution to the crop-livestock farming system by contributing draught power and manure to the crop sector. However, having huge numbers of livestock and an unmanaged grazing system has negatively affected the intended land use in the study area. Shrinking grazing land coupled with the ever-growing livestock population is likely to lead to massive overstocking, overgrazing, and the over browsing of pasture and herbs. Unlike this, some scholars argue that free grazing will pave a mechanism for increasing soil fertility through manure dropped in the field while grazing 
Very significantly, the diminishing size seen in forests and area closures and the poor performance of the free labour mobilisation campaign can be linked to many related factors raised by the community. This study identified extended campaign days, over politicisation of the movement, losing a sense of ownership, and lack of cooperation as significant bottlenecks. Extended campaign days, which occur for between 30 and 60 days, have prevented farmers from performing some social obligations and off-farm activities that sometimes can be a source of cash income. Secondly, engaging oneself for the days mentioned can make the farmer burned out and exhausted. Losing a sense of ownership and lack of cooperation among community members can also be linked with a lack of tenure security which has a gap on as how mange and utilize the natural resources, like grass, wood, and other products from the schemes. It is a kind of ad-hoc appearing campaign that lacks appropriate awareness creation, and which fails to participate the community in all stages of the planning and implementation process. A study by Ayal and others stipulated that indigenous knowledge is important and can solve grassroots problems 
Moreover, lack of firm and binding rules and bylaws was commonly cited as a reason for inadequate management and utilisation of area closures and forest resources in the studied micro-catchments. According to data acquired from many sources, many of the shared resources suffer from the tragedy of the commons. Even though the GoE and CANRS (Council of Amhara National Regional State) have passed bills and guidelines on watershed development and management 
The demographic trends of the research area and similar locations have identical manifestations of population trends explianed by a high proportion of youth. This group requires job opportunities, land to till and other means of livelihood to the extent possible. Parallel to the emerging youth population, communities' interest in maximising the benefit from common-pool resources remains a bottleneck to sustainable land resource management. As clearly stipulated in the thesis of  | Conclusions and Future Work: The reasons for the poor performance of the free labour mobilisation campaigns were high population growth, unrestricted grazing, a lack of sense of ownership and low intent to protect the schemes, over politicisation of the campaign and the use of the campaign for non-SWC activities, and engaging farmers on the campaign for extended days and the resulting burnout. Furthermore, widespread trends of free grazing possess a lion's share of responsibility for the observed resource degradation. The problem is further compounded by the presence of landless youth and their unlimited intent to earn cash from the sale of wood and grass. Land, which is completely under the federal government's control, has adversely affected the interest of farmers to invest in SWC activities because of the prevailing tenure insecurity. In addition, poor enforcement and the absence of laws and bylaws also have their own share for the recorded poor result.
To avoid further deterioration of suitable LULC and improve the quality of the ecosystem through well-coordinated free labour mobilisations, emphasis should be given to the following remedial actions. Awareness creation and training of community members on environmental education and family planning, introduction of a cut-and carry grazing system, destocking and restocking animals accordingly, job creation, amendment of the existing land tenure policy, introduction of workable SWC practices, scaling up of evidencebased best practices observed while implementing the previous campaigns, boosting community participation, and enforcing laws and bylaws have been recommended as a way forward.
Finally, this study highlights the importance of incorporating remote sensing and GIS technologies to interpolate and magnify quantitative information with qualitative local understandings to improve our knowledge of land use/cover change and mass mobilisation movements to reduce environmental degradation and bring sustainable use of natural resources.
The study could add scarce information we had related to free labour mobilisations, watershed campaigns, and sustainable land management. Correspondingly, besides its input to academia, it also helps GoE and other development actors incorporate better watershed management and free labour mobilisations in policy formulation, planning, and decision-making. The following research challenge will be identifying SWC practices most acceptable by farmers and exploring drivers of adoption and extent of sustainability using farm-level indicators.","Land quality indicators: Research plan (, , , , 2000) || Land Degradation in SubSaharan Africa: What Explains the Widespread Adoption of Unsustainable Farming Practices?

"Modeling and Prediction of Land Use Land Cover Change Dynamics Based on Land Change Modeler (LCM) in Nashe Watershed, Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia",Megersa Kebede; Tamene Demissie; Jens Tr√§nckner; Susana Mart√≠n-Fern√°ndez,"Change of land use land cover (LULC) has been known globally as an essential driver of environmental change. Assessment of LULC change is the most precise method to comprehend the past land use, types of changes to be estimated, the forces and developments behind the changes. The aim of the study was to assess the temporal and spatial LULC dynamics of the past and to predict the future using Landsat images and LCM (Land Change Modeler) by considering the drivers of LULC dynamics. The research was conducted in Nashe watershed (Ethiopia) which is the main tributary of the Upper Blue Nile basin. The total watershed area is 94,578 ha. The Landsat imagery from 2019, 2005, and 1990  was used for evaluating and predicting the spatiotemporal distributions of LULC changes. The future LULC image prediction has been generated depending on the historical trends of LULC changes for the years 2035 and 2050. LCM integrated in TerrSet Geospatial Monitoring and Modeling System assimilated with MLP and CA-Markov chain have been used for monitoring, assessment of change, and future projections. Markov chain was used to generate transition probability matrices between LULC classes and cellular automata were used to predict the LULC map. Validation of the predicted LULC map of 2019 was conducted successfully with the actual LULC map. The validation accuracy was determined using the Kappa statistics and agreement/disagreement marks. The results of the historical LULC depicted that forest land, grass land, and range land are the most affected types of land use. The agricultural land in 1990 was 41,587.21 ha which increased to 57,868.95 ha in 2019 with an average growth rate of 39.15%. The forest land, range land, and grass land declined annually with rates of 48.38%, 19.58%, and 26.23%, respectively. The predicted LULC map shows that the forest cover will further degrade from 16.94% in 2019 to 8.07% in 2050, while agricultural land would be expanded to 69,021.20 ha and 69,264.44 ha in 2035 and 2050 from 57,868.95 ha in 2019. The findings of this investigation indicate an expected rapid change in LULC for the coming years. Converting the forest area, range land, and grass land into other land uses, especially to agricultural land, is the main LULC change in the future. Measures should be implemented to achieve rational use of agricultural land and the forest conversion needs to be well managed.","Introduction: Land use land cover (LULC) change occurs under a variety of pressure and it is the result of changes or modifications in the intensity of an existing LULC type to determine the location and nature of the land use change. The changes of LULC have been perceived as worldwide environmental change drivers in the watershed that are very sensitive to LULC dynamics 
The LULC changes were broadly assessed in various areas of the world, for instance, Europe and USA 
The dynamics of LULC intensities and rates are changing because they are highly associated with the overexploitation of natural resources. The natural variability issues like climate change, soil conditions, and terrain characteristics have also accounted for land use changes 
The drivers' assessment and predicting their future LULC status in the watershed is expected to have an essential contribution for land use planning management and sustainable water resources. The use of historical satellite imageries are used to effectively monitor and analyze LULC change 
Models of land change are useful tools for environmental and other types of research concerning LULC change 
The model predicts future LULC images based upon MLPNN (Multi-Layer Perceptron neural networks) and CA-Markov Chain (CA-MC) 
Remote sensing data particularly Landsat images provide suitable possibility for LULC change monitoring, particularly for developing countries where geospatial technologies are not well developed 
Due to changes of LULC, Ethiopia experienced serious environmental problems including soil erosion, land degradation, loss of soil fertility, and deforestation 
The above research questions are so significant and addressed in this study of watershed since a dramatic socio-economic change with expected enormous effect on the land use is undergoing and this will influence various hydrological processes. Thus, especially in the UBNB, those changes need to be predicted in time for environmental management in this area in an effective and sustainable manner. The study findings are utilized to provide empirical evidence on patterns and rates and identify major driving forces of LULC dynamics at watershed level, and improve policies in land use within the framework of sustainable land use planning in relation to future changes or development. | Materials and Methods:  | Study Area: The Upper Blue Nile Basin (UBNB) is the main stream of the Nile basin and is located within the western and central part of Ethiopia between latitudes 7 ‚Ä¢ 45 and 12 ‚Ä¢ 45 N and longitudes 34 ‚Ä¢ 05 to 39 ‚Ä¢ 45 E. The UBNB consists of the major part of Ethiopia and covers an area of 157,000 km 2 . The basin is located within the region of Oromia, Amhara and Benishangul-Gumuz of Ethiopia. The basin has three main seasons: a main rainy season which occurs between June and September, a dry season from October to January, and a short rainy season between February and May. The basin mean yearly rainfall ranges within 800-2000 mm and increases with altitude. The Nashe watershed is the major tributary from the left bank within the UBNB of Ethiopia which is situated at about 300 km from Addis Ababa. The sub-basin lies in between 9 ‚Ä¢ 35 and 9 ‚Ä¢ 52 N latitudes and 37 ‚Ä¢ 00 and 37 ‚Ä¢ 20 E longitudes (Figure  | Data Types and Sources: The important spatial data required for the study were Digital Elevation Model, Landsat Images, and field data. The three Landsat images used were downloaded from the USGS (http://glovis.usgs.gov/, accessed on 2 January 2017) (Table 
The coordinates of each location selected were marked with GPS, and these points were verified in Google Earth. During field survey and data collection, socioeconomic The watershed area varies in elevation from 1600 m in the lower plateau under the escarpment to the hills and ridges of the highland climbing to over 2500 m. The annual average rainfall of the Nashe watershed ranges from 1200 mm to 1600 mm (depending on data from five weather stations); June, July, August, and September are the main rainy season of the catchment. The observed average temperature of the catchment is 22 ‚Ä¢ C. The watershed area is categorized by intensive irrigable lands at the downstream, large water potential sites at the upstream, and also with high head of hydropower potential. Agriculture is the leading financial activity in the watershed and the main source of livelihood for the local population. | Data Types and Sources: The important spatial data required for the study were Digital Elevation Model, Landsat Images, and field data. The three Landsat images used were downloaded from the USGS (http://glovis.usgs.gov/, accessed on 2 January 2017) (Table  | Land Use and Land Cover Change Assessment 2.3.1. Image Classification: The classification of images is to categorize automatically all pixels from the Landsat images into LULC classes to extract useful thematic information  | LULC Types Description:  | Agricultural Land: Includes areas used for perennial and annual crops, irrigated areas, scattered rural settlements, commercial farms (sesame cultivations and sugarcane plantations). | Forest Land: Areas covered with dense trees (deciduous forests, evergreen forests, mixed forests). | Range Land: Includes areas covered with small trees, less dense forests, bushes, and shrubs. These areas are less dense than forests. | Grass Land: Areas covered by grasses are usually used for grazing and those remain for some months in a year. | Urban Area: Areas of commercial areas, urban and rural settlements, industrial areas. | Water Body Areas covered by rivers, streams, and reservoirs: To accomplish classification of image in multi-temporal approach and for mapping purposes, the ERDAS Imagine 2015 and ArcGIS 10.3 software were used, respectively. For each LULC, as many as possible training samples were selected throughout the entire image, based on the composite images, as well as Google Earth images. For classification, verification, and validation of the classified images, the training data were used. | Accuracy Assessment: Accuracy assessment tells us to what extent the ground truth is represented on the equivalent classified image. Since land use maps derived from image classification usually contain some errors, the accuracy of classification results obtained must be assessed. Assessing the classification accuracy provides the degree of confidence in the results and the subsequent change detection 
The common and most effective method used to measure the accuracy of the classified image from remotely sensed imagery is an error/confusion matrix 
where r-rows number in the matrix, Xii-number of observations in row i and column i (the diagonal elements), X + i and Xi+-the marginal totals of row i and column I, respectively, and N-observations number. | Land Use Land Cover Change Drivers: Driving factors influence LULC changes. LULC changes are driven by natural and human activities 
The evidence likelihood is an empirical probability of change in the LULC categories between an earlier and a later map  | LULC Change Prediction and Validation:  | LULC Prediction: The LCM (Land Change Modeler) embedded in the TerrSet Geospatial Monitoring and Modeling System (TGMMS) software was used for prediction of future LULC for a specified year based on the classified historical satellite images. The LCM determines how the factors influence future LULC change, how much land cover change took place between earlier and later LULC, and then calculates a relative amount of transitions 
The trend variations of LULC changes for the years 1990, 2005, and 2019 were analyzed to predict future years of the watershed. The future land use scenarios were based on recent trends, historical land use information, and anticipated future changes. The LCM uses the ""change analysis"" tab, the ""transition potentials"" tab, and the ""change prediction"" tab. The change rates were determined through the ""change analysis"" tab, along with the ""transition potential"" maps to simulate the future scenario. The LCM module allows three different approaches to produce maps of transition potential based on the individual sub-models and associated explanatory variables: multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network, logistic regression, and a similarity-weighted instance-based machine learning tool (SimWeight) 
The TerrSet model uses CA-MC which is a stochastic modeling process to simulate the future changing over time from past changes 
where 0 ‚â§ Pij < 1 and
The cellular automata model can be expressed by the following equation:
where S (t) and S (t+1) are the system status at times t and t + 1, respectively, N-cellular field, t and t + 1 are the different times, f-transformation rule of cellular states in local space, S-the set of limited and discrete cellular states, Pij-the transition probability matrix in a state.
The CA-Markov considers constraints and factors to prepare a single map of suitability  | Model Validation: Validation is simply a procedure to assess the quality of the predicted LULC map against a reference map 
The map shows areas where the model correctly predicted called ""hits"", areas where the model predicted change but it actually did not occur called ""false alarms"", and occasions where the model was unable to predict it, but areas are changed in reality, called ""misses"". After the model prediction capacity was verified between the 1990 and 2005 time periods for 2019, the simulation process was repeated to project the 2035 and 2050 map using 2005 and 2019 classified maps. The other method is the kappa coefficient calculation between the predicted map and actual land use map 
The overall agreement of the projected and reference map indicates the Kappa for no information (Kno). The location kappa (Klocation) is used to compute the spatial accuracy in the overall landscape, because of the correct assignment values in each category between the simulated and reference map  | Analysis of Land Use Land Cover Change: The change of LULC assessment was computed using the LCM model. Different LULC categories of quantitative assessment, net change of LULC categories, and the contributors to the net change experienced by each LULC class are the three sections of results identified in the LCM. Change analysis was performed by using the classified maps  | Percent of change =: Ay -Ax Ax * 100
Rate of change (ha/year) = Ay -Ax T
where Ax is the area of LULC (ha) of an earlier land cover image, Ay is the area of LULC (ha) of a later land cover image, T is the time interval between Ax and Ay in years. | Results and Discussions:  | Accuracy Assessment of the Classified Images: The assessment of accuracy was performed for LULC change analysis by generating confusion/error matrix in each LULC category of 1990, 2005, and 2019 classified maps. The overall accuracy, kappa statistics, producer's and user's accuracy have been used for assessment. The kappa statistics and overall accuracy of classified images shows 91.43%, 87.59%, 85.71% and 0.93, 0.90, and 0.88 for the years 2019, 2005, and 1990, respectively (Table 
The accuracy assessment of LULC is required in any study using remote sensing Landsat data for the historical LULC. According to the authors of  | LULC Change Analysis: The change of the LULC analysis was through evaluation of gains, net change, and losses experienced by different categories using change analysis in LCM. The evaluation of spatial and temporal changes between various classes during the period 1990, 2005, and 2019 was analyzed (Figure  | LULC Change Analysis: The change of the LULC analysis was through evaluation of gains, net change, and losses experienced by different categories using change analysis in LCM. The evaluation of spatial and temporal changes between various classes during the period 1990, 2005, and 2019 was analyzed (Figure 
Although forest land, range land, and grass land experienced reduction in coverage throughout the study periods, the greatest reduction rate was observed in forest land. To mitigate the rapid rates of LULC conversions at watershed, the application of integrated watershed management strategies, managing the rapid population growth, afforestation of degraded or deforested areas, and reducing the dependency of locals on forest products is critically important. The findings of the study are consistent with other studies conducted in Ethiopia by the authors of  | Driver Variables of LULC Change: The driver variables influencing changes are based on spatial analysis and added to the model either as static or dynamic components

In 2005-2019, especially since 2012, a dam on Nashe River was built for irrigation and hydropower purposes. The water body has increased. The displacement of communities occurred from their land during the expansion of hydropower projects and the displacement caused land scarcity. The lowland areas of the watershed was covered with forests, range lands, and grass lands before 1990 even before 2005. Currently, however, a great decline of forest cover is occurring because of urbanization and agricultural land expansion. In recent times, the expansion of urban areas has been continuously increasing at the highest rate.
The findings of the study show that urban area increase was consistent with other research findings in Africa  | Validation of the Model: The agreement of the two categorical maps was measured by using Validation Module. In order to assess the accuracy, validation of the model is necessary. Validation is significant as it allows to determine the quality of the predicted land cover map with actual map. A comparison was made between the actual and simulated LULC map of 2019 so as to validate the predicted map. The less effective simulated LULC class is water body as the projected map was from the maps before construction of the dam and the actual LULC map is from after the construction. The validation results between the simulated and actual LULC test summary of the model are presented in Table

Significant change was observed from the change analysis result in LULC change between 1990 and 2050. Agricultural land will be the predominant LULC type. It was seen from the result as the area of agricultural land increment from 61.19% in 2019 to 72.98% in 2035 and 73.24% in 2050. This was mainly caused by converting forest, range, and some parts of grass land. Agricultural land increased significantly from 1990 to 2035 and then slowly from 2035 to 2050 (Figure 
Ref.  | Conclusions: The present study was carried out to understand the changes in the historical and predicted land use land cover patterns from the year 1990 to 2050. The integrated approach including remote sensing, GIS, and a MLPNN-based CA-MC model was used to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of LULC and prediction of future LULC change in Nashe watershed, Ethiopia. The conclusions drawn from the research findings were the following.
The multitemporal satellite imagery data are used for informed decision-making in LULC change, providing the potential information required for monitoring and evaluating of LULC changes. The precision of the data from the remotely sensed imagery classified based on the maximum likelihood classification method with high resolution image of Landsat was checked through an error matrix and it yielded an acceptable result that was further processed for analysis.
To validate the model, the projected 2019 LULC map was compared with 2019 actual LULC map. After successful model validation, the LULC map for the years 2035 and 2050 were simulated by considering the business-as-usual scenario. In this procedure, we used 1990-2005 and 2005-2019 LULC data as a baseline and current scenario for comparison. Its validation showed a strong correlation between the simulated LULC map and satellitederived map, which proved the simulation model's reliability.
The rapid and massive changes of LULC in the watershed may have serious environmental impacts. The analysis of LULC change shows that forest cover has been decreasing, as well as the high increasing rate of urban area and agricultural land. The predicted LULC situation show that this cover would continue in the future. This will increase vulnerability of the watershed to landslides, soil loss, gully erosion, worsened air pollution, and impact the hydrology of the studied watershed in particular and the Blue Nile Basin The forest land and range land show a decreasing trend from 2019 to 2035. Unfortunately, the grass land, range land, and agricultural land will slightly increase from 2035 to 2050. This might be due to the limited area of land for different purposes. The major contributing factors to LULC change were the expansion of hydropower and irrigation projects, mostly at the downstream, for expansion of a sugar factory. The scarcity of jobs and urban expansions in the catchment amplified the socio-economic activities for LULC changes. In the watershed, the downstream and partly at the upstream areas, which were previously covered by forests and range lands, have been converted to agricultural land and commercial crop farms.
Forest reduction also occurred as a result of using charcoal and firewood as the energy source for most of the people living around the watershed, who depend on fuel wood. Additionally, most of the evacuated population during the construction of Nashe and Amerti projects were involved in converting the forest land to agriculture and settlement. Illegal and unplanned settlements by the local people to expand agriculture and settlement also contributed to destruction of forest land, range land, and grass land. Thus, the forest conversion needs to be controlled and well-managed, and a reasonable land use plan should be developed in an organized way. The expansion of one LULC type occurs at the detriment of other LULC classes 
From the temporal patterns of the changes between 1990 and 2019, forest land decreased at a higher rate. The other affected LULC types were range land and grass land. The urban land and water body LULC classes gained trends in the study. Simulation analysis was conducted for the years of 2035 and 2050 based on historical LULC change data from 1990-2005, 2005-2019, and 1990-2019, which were used as a baseline. Similar to the historical analysis of LULC change, the predicted results of forest, grass, and range land classes were registered net loss in the area from 1990 to 2035. Whereas, the range land and grass land smoothly gained from 2035-2050. The predicted results of the year 2035 and 2050 show an increase in agriculture, water body and urban land. Therefore, future land use activities ought to be based on proper land use development and land regulation to reduce the enduring adverse impact of LULC changes. Ref.

To validate the model, the projected 2019 LULC map was compared with 2019 actual LULC map. After successful model validation, the LULC map for the years 2035 and 2050 were simulated by considering the business-as-usual scenario. In this procedure, we used 1990-2005 and 2005-2019 LULC data as a baseline and current scenario for comparison. Its validation showed a strong correlation between the simulated LULC map and satellitederived map, which proved the simulation model's reliability.
The rapid and massive changes of LULC in the watershed may have serious environmental impacts. The analysis of LULC change shows that forest cover has been decreasing, as well as the high increasing rate of urban area and agricultural land. The predicted LULC situation show that this cover would continue in the future. This will increase vulnerability of the watershed to landslides, soil loss, gully erosion, worsened air pollution, and impact the hydrology of the studied watershed in particular and the Blue Nile Basin in general.
Therefore, suitable and timely management measures must be taken by policy decision makers to enable sustainable development and to protect the watershed in order to reduce the severity of the changes.
Settlement expansion, agricultural expansion, firewood extraction, land tenure policy, and infrastructure development were the top LULC change drivers. Moreover, to ensure a better environmental condition, this kind of study revealed a significant prospective to contribute towards the sustainable environmental planning and management system of an area at the local and global levels.
Finally, it can be concluded that the projected conditions may be reversed, which is very important to reduce the enduring adverse impact of LULC changes on the watershed hydrological components through the announced nationwide tree planting, implementing the strategy of climate resilient green economy and formulating the local-and regional-scale policies required for sustainable development. Future studies incorporating the assessment of land use and land cover change impacts on the hydrological parameters of the watershed would be helpful for better management of the watershed.","Watershed Management in Action: Lessons Learned from FAO Field Projects; Food & Agriculture Organization (, 2017) || How dynamics and drivers of land use/land cover change impact elephant conservation and agricultural livelihood development in Rombo (, , , 2017) || Comparing two approaches to land use/cover change modeling and their implications for the assessment of biodiversity loss in a deciduous tropical forest (, , , 2012) || Evaluating drivers of land-use change and transition potential models in a complex landscape in Southern Mexico (, , , 2013) || Climate Change and Food Security: Risks and Responses; Food & Agriculture Organization (, 2015) || Land Use and Land Cover Mapping in Europe (, , 2014) || Land use change exacerbates tropical South American drought by sea surface temperature variability Land use change exacerbates tropical South American drought by sea surface temperature variability (, , , , 2011) || Tropical forests were the primary sources of new agricultural land in the 1980s and (, , , , , , , 1990) || Patterns, causes and consequences of land use / cover dynamics in the Gumara watershed of lake Tana basin (, , , 2016) || Evaluation and prediction of land use/land cover changes in the Andassa watershed (, , , , 2017) || National level land-use changes in functional urban areas in Poland, Slovakia, and Czechia (, , , 2021) || Landscape and urban planning landscape transformation processes in two large and two small cities in Egypt and Jordan over the last five decades using remote sensing data (, , , , 2020) || Changes in agricultural land use in the context of ongoing transformational processes in Slovakia (, , , , 2013) || Land-cover and land-use change in a Mediterranean landscape: A spatial analysis of driving forces integrating biophysical and human factors (, , , 2008) || Ecological planning for sustainable development with a green technology : GIS (, , , 2014) || Modelling and analyzing the watershed dynamics using Cellular Automata (CA)-Markov model-A geo-information based approach (, , , , , 2012) || Land use/land cover change modeling and the prediction of subsequent changes in ecosystem service values in a coastal area of China, the Su-Xi-Chang region (, , , , , 2017. 1204) || Land-use and land-cover scenarios and spatial modeling at the regional scale.
