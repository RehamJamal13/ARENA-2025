ABSTRACT:
Information on Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes and the driving forces behind such modifications underpin a proper understanding of the dynamics of LULC changes. This study aimed to analyse the dynamics of LULC change trends and its driving factors in Jimma Geneti District (JGD) for the year 1973-2019. Five satellite images downloaded from USGS were used to analyze and assess the geospatial and temporal changes in LULC. In addition, in-depth household interviews, key informant interview, focus group discussions (FGD) and field observations were used to address the drivers of LULC changes. The result showed a decline in forest land from 8632.5 ha (20.9 %) in 1973-5647.23 ha (13.7 %) in 2019. The study further revealed that the total of forest land cleared between 1973 and 2019 was estimated to be 2985.27 ha (7.22 %). In other words, 34.6 % of the forest cover that existed in 1973 was lost. Similarly, wetlands declined from 9919.5 ha (24.0 %) in 1973-2000.24 ha (4.8 %) in 2019. Similarly, wetlands declined from 9919.5 ha (24.0 %) in 1973-2000.24 ha (4.8 %) in 2019. On the other hand, cultivated land has increased from 18617.0 ha (45.1 %) to 27708.1 ha (67.1 %). Similarly, the increment in settlement areas has elevated from 908.7 ha (2.2 %) to 4436.46 ha (10.7 %) during the same period. Agricultural expansion, cutting trees for various purposes (such as firewood, charcoal and construction material), overgrazing and the expansion of settlements, were identified as the major proximate causes of these changes. Moreover, the major underlying drivers of LULC changes include population growth, changes in policy and institutions, poverty and lack of awareness on the importance of natural resource conservation for sustainable livelihoods. From this study, it can be concluded that JGD has experienced a significant change in LULC over the past 46 years and were affected both positively and negatively. Hence, a wide range of policy packages are required for sustainable land management practices which take in to account synergies and trade-offs between the various land uses in the study area. The national and local governments should enforce sustainable land management approaches through integrating land use planning and management into all development programmes and projects.

## Introduction ##
Land is an indispensable natural resource, which has enormous economic, social and biophysical uses. As a result, land use and land cover (LULC) are under a continuous changes mainly because of societal development and natural causes. LULC changes are fundamental processes on the earth's surface and have significant impacts on human society, climate, biodiversity, hydrological cycles, ecosystems, biogeochemical cycles and many other processes 
Changes in land cover have become key components of global environmental change and represent impact of human activity 
Apositive side of LULC change is agricultural land expansion, which increases food production for a rapidly growing population. Although, LULC change has social and economic benefits, it has also been reported to have an impact on spatial patterns of landscape properties by modifying ecosystems at local, regional and global levels 
Generally, LULC changes are driven by natural factors and anthropogenic activities 
Since 1950, the world population has increased exponentially and this growth is producing major changes in LULC. In Ethiopia, population growth has been identified as the main driving force in LULC change and is contributing to natural resource degradation 
As it is aforementioned above, land cover change is a widespread phenomenon and LULC change has increasingly become a key research priority for national and international research programs examining global natural resources and environmental change 
Among several factors affecting LULC changes in Ethiopa, the three major factors include population growth, increasing agricultural investments and resettlement programmes 

## Material and methods ##


## Description of the study area ##
The study site, Jimma Geneti District(JGD) is located in HoroGuduruWollega Zone, Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. The district covers a total area of 48,251 ha (482.51 sq.km) (Fig. 
The major livelihood activity of the population in the district is mixed-farming (JGDANRO, 2018) with crop cultivation being the major agricultural activity, which is entirely rain-fed, with livestock rearing as a secondary activity. Pertaining to this, there are different types of land use observed in the study area (Table 
The total population of Jimma Geneti district is 93,711, out of which 

## Data sources and acquisition method 2.2.1. Satellite data acquisition method ##
Globally, satellite images are playing a vital role in monitoring spatial and temporal landscape change 

## Household survey ##
The data for the drivers of LULC change were collected from 134 household heads selected randomly to participate in in-depth interviews, key informants interview and focus group discussions (FGD). A three stage sampling technique was employed in selecting the district, administration and household respondents, by combining purposive and random sampling, while the household respondents were selected by systematic random sampling. Accordingly, out of 4531 households, 134 were selected (48 households from Gidami Dabsho, 32 from AdilekaTulu Chali Keble, and 54 from Damu Gembo Kebele). Moreover, participants as key informants and FGDs were selected purposively from each sampled (village). One FGD constituted of six to eight members from different social groups (youth, women and elders). Data collected from questioners were coded and categorized into a suitable data entry format using statistical package for social scientists (SPSS) window version 20.0 software and described by using frequency and percentage.
The sample size of the survey study was determined following 
e 2 (N-1) +Z 2 *p *q Where n = sample size Z = 95 confidence limit (interval) under normal curve that is 1.96 P = 0.1(proportion of the population to be included in the sample that is 10 %) q = none occurrence of event = 1-0.1 that is (0.9) N = Total number of household = 4531 e = margin of error or degree of accuracy (accepted error term) (0.05) Thus, n=1.96 2 *0.1*0.9*4531 = 134 0.05 2 (4531-1) +1.96 2 *0.1*0.9

## Image preparation and processing ##
As raw satellite images are affected by systematic and random errors and were, not directly utilized for feature identification and any applications. Therefore, some image corrections were carried out following the methods in the literature 
As it has been repeatedly described, in image analysis, ground reference data play an important role to determine information classes, interpret decisions and assess accuracies of results 

## Table 1 ##
LULC classes and their thematic description in the study area.

## LULC class Description ##
Settlement area Areas occupied by residential houses and other buildings Bare Land
Exposed stone, sand and soil or area with no vegetation or dominated by rock-out crops, roads, eroded and degraded lands Forest Land Land with more than 0.5 ha, with a tree canopy cover of more than 10 %, which is not primarily under agricultural or other specific non-forest land use (FAO, 2000) Cultivated land
Areas of land ploughed/prepared for growing crops by rain fed or irrigation, including fallow plots and degraded grazing land with very few scattered vegetation Water Body
Areas of land covered with water (lakes and rivers) Wet Land
Areas that is waterlogged or swampy during the wet season and relatively dry during the dry season. It also includegrazing land around the wetland.
were employed for satellite image processing and LULC change analysis.
ERDAS Imagine Software was also used to perform classification and post classification comparison of change detection, which involves the application of multi-temporal datasets to analyze the changes between consecutive classification years. This is a process of sorting pixels into a finite number of individual classes or categories of data, based on their data file values 
The reconnaissance survey, assisted by information collected from the FGD coupled with interpretation of remotely sensed satellite images was employed. Each satellite image was classified into different LULC classes, using supervised image classification coupled with the maximum likelihood classification algorithm. Ground truth data collection was carried out for collecting absolute location of different land use, for the use as training sites during classification and for accuracy assessment of the classified LULC map of 2019. A total of 180 ground control point (GCPs), 30 for each LULC type, were collected randomly from the study areas. The final images were converted to LULC maps. The temporal and spatial change observed between five classification intervals were statistics computed and presented in three different ways. These are the total LULC in ha, the percentage LULC changes and the rate of change between classification periods (Fig. 

## Result and discussion ##


## Accuracy assessment ##
The overall producer's accuracy assessment for the year 2019 was found to be 83 %, with 96 % for cultivated land and 94 % for settlement areas (Table 

## LULC classes of the study area ##
Six major types of LULC were identified by using field data and satellite images of the years of 
To understand the changes occurring within a period of time, temporal analysis approach was carried out. Also, LULC dynamic results were obtained by using combined methods of remote sensing and GIS techniques from Landsat images of the aforementioned years. Statistical summaries of the different LULC dynamics are presented in Table 

## Land Use Land Cover ##
The highest increment in the percentage of cultivated land (and hence diminishing of wetland and forestland) has been observed between the years of 1987 and 1995, which can be attributed to the spike in small-scale farming (Table 
It is worth mentioning that this finding is in line with prior studies that reported 44 % growth in agriculture and 36.4 % agricultural land increment, respectively, by 

## Bare land (BL) ##
. Bare lands have also been transformed into another land use types. In the study area under consideration, it was found that the bare land proportion has shown significant declines over the span of years. Indeed, the data obtained shows a decline of the bare land proportion from 2872.1 ha (7%) in 1973, to 551.34 ha (1.3 %) in 2019 and a progressive decline between the stated years (Table 
Computed from the collected data, it can be seen that the bare land has been converted to other land use types at the rate of 50.45ha/year during the study periods of 1973-2019 (Table 
In this regard, it is also worth indicating that the results of this study are similar to a number other previous studies undertaken in different parts of Ethiopia. For instance, 

## Wetland (WL). ##
The result of the study further revealed a continuous decline in the overall area of wetland with the average rate of 172.6 ha/year from year of 1973-2019. As can be seen in Table 
The result of this study is in agreement with the study of 
Most croplands were situated in relatively flat areas in 1957, however, these areas were affected by the construction of the Fincha dam in 1973 
BL-bare land, CL-cultivated land, FL-forestland, SA-settlement area, WB-water body, WL-wetland.
The result indicated a series of LULC changes over the last 46 years . In this regard, the trend shows a tendency towards more plots of lands being shifted to be used for cultivation and settlement. At the same time, the water body becomes more important. On the contrary, the coverages of bare-lands and wetlands have declined in size as they have been converted to cultivation and settlement areas. This is inline with the findings of 

## LULC change matrix ##
An important aspect of change detection is to determine what is really changing and to which LULC type, i.e., which land use class is changing to other types of land use class 
In this study, though some areas gained from other LULC classes, shrinkage was also observed in forest cover and bare land over the entire study period. The largest area of change matrix was observed from wetland to cultivated land, as compared to other land uses. The dominant contributors to the decline of forest cover were the conversions of forest land to cultivated land 3608.44 ha (41.8 %), wetlands 965.52 ha (11.18 %) and settlement areas 717.72 ha (8.3 %) as shown in (Table 
While some parts of the original cultivated land was were lost to other LULC classes, such as settlement area, 1983.87 ha(10.66 %) and it has also expanded, mainly due to area gains from wetlands,5445.92 ha (54.9 %), forest land, 3608.44 ha (41.8 %) and bare land, 2069.82 ha (72 %), as shown in (Table 

## Analysis of rate and patterns of LULC dynamics 1973-2019 ##
During the 1973-2019 years periods, three land use types had shown an increasing trend; cultivated land (48.83 %), settlement areas (38.8 %) and water bodies (164 %). During this period, forest land 2985.27ha (34.6 %), bare land 2320.76 ha (80.8 %) and wetland 7919.26 ha (395.9 %), was lost in the study area. Particularly, the highest amount of wetland coverage accounted for 6652.08ha has been lost during the period 1987-1995. Likewise, the forest ecosystem, which covered1833.15 ha also declined between 1973-1987 (Table 
Regarding LULC change, agricultural land increased annually by 
Within the 46 years of this study period, bare and forest lands have shown consistent reductions, whereas cultivated lands and forest lands increased at the expense of the aforementioned as well as a wetland, land use types. However, wetlands and water body has shown inconsistencies in changes of their coverages (Table 

## Drivers of LULC changes ##


## Proximate drivers ##
From data gathered from the respondents, a total of eight factors were identified as the major direct drivers of LULC dynamics in the study area (Fig. 
The Majority of the respondents also identified firewood collection (93.3 %), house construction/settlement (90 %), land degradation (88.8 %), overgrazing (88.8 %,) and charcoal making (87.3) (Fig. 
Respondents also viewed overgrazing as an important driver of changes in the study area 
Cutting of Cordia africana, Podocarpus falcatus and Juniperus procera for timber trade was (58.2 % of respondents) registered as another prominent factor that threatened the forest cover of the study area. Rapid population growth resulted in huge demands for timber for construction purposes in the surrounding towns and villages, triggering illegal loggings from among communal forests. Through time, depletion of forests (a decline of forest areas) continued triggering the like of timber prices in towns (Plate 3 ). As acknowledged by the respondents, although the government has put strong regulations in place to prevent illegal logging, such activity is still continuing cutting down of trees for different purposes
Infrastructure developments, such as schools and roads, were also found to have contributed to the decline of grazing lands. Respondents (76.9 %) argued that the expansion of rural and urban settlements was the cause of LULC dynamics in the JGD. Previous studies (for example 

## Underlying causes of LULC dynamics ##
Most respondents (90.3 %) confirmed that population growth is the most important underlying driver of LULC dynamics (Fig. 
The results of the FGDs are also in line with CSA reports showing increments in a total population of the study area. In 1994 the population of the study area was 47,199 
Policy and institutional factors were found to be the underlying drivers of LULC dynamics accounting for about 76.1 % of respondents. According to the information obtained from FGDs, the villagization policy called"Sefera" where people were clustered into villages during the Derge regime, which means the resettlement policy contributed to the expansion of settlements and agriculture land. National and regional policies on land use and economic development, such as infrastructural expansion (e.g. roads, schools, markets etc.), attaining food self-sufficiency through investment in agriculture are other factors contributing to LULC change. Lack of proper land use plans is another policy related driver of forest and vegetation cover change. It is characterized by the encroachment of vegetated lands especially forest, grazing land and cultivation on steep slopes.
Information obtained from FGDs indicates that manifestations of weak law enforcement in the study area resulted in corruption and delays in decision-making by courts. Participants also said that change in land tenure systems was another policy-related driver of forest and vegetation cover change. During the Derge regime, large areas of forest and grazing land were converted to other land use types, due to change in the land policy from the previous government 
Distribution of land and resource among small-scale farmers following the 1975 'land to tiller policy' which means the land and the resources were divided into pieces among peasants or smallholding farmers.
However, the current FDRE government considers the land as public property and land is, therefore, administered by the government 
Poverty, unemployment, lack of off-farm jobs (especially among the landless and educated youth), and change in rural economic activities are the main economic causes of LULC dynamics in the study area. About 85.1 % of respondents and FGD participants stated that the major underlying economic factors behind the expansion of agricultural land are illegal logging, charcoal making and firewood extraction. Due to lack of off-farm employment opportunities, adults in the study area who remain are unemployed. This results in land fragmentation as land is shared within families and encroachment of forest areas in search of new land for cultivation and firewood take place. Hence, economically poor and landless households are engaged in logging in the form of charcoal and firewood to be able to provide for their families. World Commission on Environment and Development points out that people who are poor and hungry devastate their immediate environment in order to survive 
Socio-cultural factors were found to be an important underlying driving force of LULC change by 85.1 % of respondents. Lack of awareness about the negative impacts of forest conversion, distribution of land and other resources are the socio-cultural causes for the expansion of agricultural lands at the expense of other LULC types, mainly wetland and forests.
The main limitationIt of this study include shortage of time and small finical support to collect ground truth for verification, gather information from respondents on drivers of LULC changes and interpretation and the difficult of classification of images due to similarity of spectral signature of features in mapping urban land use land cover changes

## Conclusion and recommendation ##
This study has analyzed the dynamics of land use and land cover and explored the drivers over the past 46 years  in the study area. Analyses of LULC dynamics over four decades using GIS and remote sensing tools produced six types of LULC categories. Land use classes experienced prominent land cover dynamics during the study period. Quantitative spatio-temporal evidence produced through interpretations of satellite images showed that the study area has undergone significant LULC change since 1973.
The LULC types were affected both positively and negatively in the last 46 years. The pattern of the LULC change in different categories showed variation during the five periods considered 
LULC dynamics in the study area were attributed to a combination of drivers (proximate and underlying causes), i.e. the proximate causes include agricultural expansion, particularly small scale farming, wood extraction for firewood and charcoal making, construction of infrastructure (for example schools, roads), overgrazing and expansion of rural and urban settlements, whereas population pressure, policy and institutions, poverty, lack of awareness and biophysical factors were claimed as major underlying drivers of LULC change.
Results of this study could help decision making bodies as it provides information that supports to take measures involving integrated land use planning and management and future developments.
