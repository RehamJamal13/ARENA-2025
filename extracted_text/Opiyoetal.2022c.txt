ABSTRACT:
Understanding land use and land cover (LULC) change dynamics and their contributing factors are critical for developing sustainable land management strategies. Therefore, this paper assesses the trends and patterns of LULC changes and their drivers in the Migori River watershed in Kenya from 1980 to 2020. The spatial analysis is based on remote sensing data based on the maximum likelihood classifier algorithm; whereas the analysis of the drivers is based on index-based ranking and logistic regression of 318 households' survey data. The results show that between 1980 and 2020, the watershed experienced a considerable decline in shrub lands by 40.63% (À235.97 km 2 ), grasslands by 84.86% (À59.14 km 2 ), forests by 52.90% (À98.36 km 2 ), water by 82.03% (À39.27 km 2 ) and wetlands by 38.44% (À3.69 km 2 ); whereas cultivated land, bare land and built-up areas expanded over the same period by 34.25% (+347.42 km 2 ), 132.28% (+60.95 km 2 ) and 461.20% (+25.32 km 2 ), respectively. The results of the household survey revealed that the perceptions of the locals tended to corroborate these observed LULC patterns obtained from spatial analysis, with 60.50% (n = 192) of the respondents reporting a significant expansion in agricultural land use (at p < 0.05), and 75.80% (n = 241) observing a significant decline in forest areas in the watershed (at p < 0.05). Fuel wood collection, timber/poles production, agricultural expansion, population pressure, and high poverty are the major drivers of these LULC changes. The findings also revealed that educational level significantly influenced the survey participants' perceptions concerning these drivers. The paper concludes that the watershed's natural landscapes have been undergoing destruction at the expense of human settlement and infrastructural developments driven by anthropogenic activities. Therefore, there is a need, among others, for land use zoning to regulate conflicting land uses on the watershed between settlement, conservation, and agricultural lands.

## Introduction ##
Since the 1970s, land use and land cover (LULC) change has been an important research topic, receiving significant attention from the scientific world 
Land use and land cover change have significant effects on the functioning of socio-economic and ecosystems with important tradeoffs for sustainability, biodiversity, food security, and socio-economic vulnerability of communities and ecological systems 
The present study focuses on the Migori River watershed, one of the hotspots of biodiversity situated in the Kenyan Lake Victoria basin. This region has been continuously experiencing extensive vegetation loss and fragmentation of its natural landscapes over the last few decades due to agricultural expansion, infrastructural development, and increased occurrence of natural hazards such as floods and landslides 

## Materials and methods ##


## Description of the study area ##
The Migori River watershed (Fig. 
The watershed is divided into six agro-ecological areas, ranging from Upper Midland 1-3, which covers sections of Rongo, Uriri, Kuria East, and Kuria West Sub-Counties, to Lower Midland 1-5, which covers sections of Rongo, Uriri, Nyatike and Suna East Sub-Counties 

## Satellite imagery data acquisition ##
A combination of remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) is used to assess the trends and patterns of land use and land cover changes in the Migori River watershed between 1980 and 2020 at the recommended 10-year intervals 

## Data pre-processing ##
After the acquisition, the raw satellite images were imported into ERDAS Imagine 2020 Version by Hexagon Geospatial for standard pre-processing procedures undertaken before classification to improve their visualization and interpretability. First, radiometric/atmospheric correction was performed to reduce the effects of haze captured on the Landsat images following the approach described by 

## Data processing and analysis ##
After successful pre-processing and prior to classification, the training and validation datasets of different periods used for classification and accuracy assessment, respectively, were collected from the Google Earth desktop application as described  by 

## Post-processing analysis ##
Accuracy assessment was done through the generation of confusion/error matrices in which the data from LULC classification are compared to the ground-truthing data acquired from fieldwork. This study used 160 ground reference points (20 reference points for each LULC class) and reference data extracted from Google Earth images for accuracy assessment. The positions of the reference points were automatically identified on the classified images and their class values were defined to determine the accuracy of a pixel. The statistical components of the confusion matrix namely, producer's accuracy, user's accuracy, overall accuracy, kappa statistics, and overall kappa coefficient were calculated for all the classified LULC images based on the algorithms provided in 
where r is the annual rate of change for each LULC category (in percentage), and A 2 and A 1 are areas of each LULC category at the end (t 2 ) and the beginning (t 1 ), respectively, for the period under review.

## Household survey ##
Sample size and sampling procedure A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted between January and February 2022, among 318 randomly selected households in the Migori River watershed, using pre-tested, intervieweradministered semi-structured questionnaires. The household questionnaires consisted of various questions designed to get information on the perceptions of the local communities on LULC changes and the drivers in the Migori River watershed from 1980 to 2020. The questionnaire was initially pretested in 30 households in the Awendo Sub-county, which neighbors the watershed and isn't part of the actual survey after which the adjustments were effected before the actual household survey. Prior to the survey, village elders and local administration officials were consulted to explain the purpose of the study, understand the local realities (which helped in developing questionnaire items), and obtain permission to visit the selected households. During the exercise, the questionnaires were administered to household heads or other senior members of the selected households who had lived in the watershed for at least ten years, upon obtaining verbal consent. Cultural norms dictated that the male be interviewed as the head of the household unless absent then the spouse or adult (over 21 years) family member who understands the family and area well. Each interview lasted about 35 min on average.

## Characteristics of the sampled households ##
A summary of the socio-economic characteristics of the respondents is presented in Table 

## Statistical analyses ##
The LULC change analysis was conducted using ArcGIS Desktop by Esri (Version 10.2) and ERDAS Imagine 2020 by Hexagon Geospatial, in a process that combined GIS and remote sensing techniques. The socio-economic survey data was analyzed using the IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (Version 24.0) in which both descriptive statistics and regression analyses were conducted. After obtaining the descriptive statistics, ranking the LULC change drivers for the watershed based on the weighted average was computed using the Relative Importance Index (RII) equation (2) adopted by previous studies 
where R n = value of the lowest/last rank e.g. if the lowest/last rank is 5 in the Likert-scale used, then R n = 5 and R n À 1 = 4; R 1 = value of the highest/first rank in the Likert-scale used, usually 1; C n = counts/number of observations on lowest/last rank; C 1 = counts/number of observations on highest/first rank; A = the highest value in the overall ranking scale, and N = total number of respondents. Logistic regression analysis is carried out using equation (3) to determine the drivers of LULC changes at the household level in the Migori River watershed. In this model, the independent variables comprised the socio-economic attributes whereas the dependent variables are the respondent's perceptions of the driving forces of LULC change. The logistic regression analysis at the household level approximated the probability of the effects of the independent variables on the dependent variables 
where Y = dependent variable indicating the likelihood that Y = 1, a = the intercept, b 1 . . . b n n = coefficients of associated independent variables, and X 1 . . . X n = independent variables.

## Results and discussion ##


## Accuracy assessment of the LULC classification ##
The classified imageries have an overall accuracy of over 86.00% (Table 
LULC change dynamics in Migori River watershed from 1980 to 2020 LULC changes have been investigated for the years 
Overall trend analysis of LULC changes  The proportionate coverage area of each of the eight classes extracted in the watershed from 1980 to 2020 of LULC change trends is summarized in Table 
Forest cover in the watershed seems to have declined by about 52.90% (1.48 km 2 /year) notwithstanding the forest conservation efforts since the 1980s championed by the Permanent Presidential Commission on Soil Conservation and Afforestation. This can be attributed to the expansion of rural and urban settlements and farmlands, weak enforcement of conservation laws, and increased demand for timber as raw materials for construction and fuel wood for household usage. Although grasslands exhibited an irregular pattern of spatio-temporal changes across the five reference periods, it has experienced a decline of approximately 84.86% (1.48 km 2 /year) over the past 40 years. This substantial decline in grasslands is an indication of the increasing demand for agricultural lands and the development of forests in some of the grasslands. Moreover, the irregular pattern of changes observed in grasslands from 1980 to 2020 can be attributed to the destruction by constant incidences of fire outbreaks that usually occur in the area during periods of droughts 
Similar to grasslands, the patterns of spatio-temporal changes in shrub lands showed that it has declined by 40.63% (5.90 km 2 / year) over the four-decade period, which was largely attributed to the conversion to cultivated lands and settlements due to population pressure. Since 1980, water declined by 82.03% (0.98 km 2 /year) while the wetlands shrunk by 38.44% (0.1 km 2 / year). This declining trend in areas under water and wetlands could be attributed to the emergence and growth of aquatic vegetation and invasive species in these areas, frequent occurrence of droughts in the area 

## Decadal trend analysis of LULC changes ##
A decade-by-decade analysis of the rates of change in LULC between 1980 and 2020 in the watershed revealed specific net changes in the form of gains and losses for each class during the 1st period 
(I) The pattern of LULC changes between 1980 and 1990.
From 1980 to 1990, the watershed experienced considerable positive and negative transformations in the LULC coverage (Table 
During the same period, shrub land continued to show a negative trend with a 58.38% net loss while built-up lands continued to experience a positive trend with a net gain of 51.23%. These environmental transformations could generally be attributed to the high rate of population growth observed in Kenya from the late 1980s towards the new millennium, which was estimated to be between 3.20 and 3.60% per annum (UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2019). During the same period, the population growth rate of the entire Lake Victoria basin, under which the watershed is located, was touted to be among the highest in the country at 2.85% per year 
(III) The pattern of LULC changes between 2000 and 2010. Fig. 
(IV) The pattern of LULC changes between 2010 and 2020.
Between 2010 and 2020, grasslands declined by 86.95%, forests by 17.91%, and water by 50.09% unlike other categories that increased -shrub land by 47.56%, bare land by 69.15%, built-up area by 272.55%, and wetlands by 10.67%, with cultivated land remaining fairly constant (Table

## Watershed community perceptions on trends and drivers of LULC changes ##
Local community perceptions concerning the trends of LULC changes and distances to infrastructure Survey participants' perceptions of LULC trends in the Migori River watershed are presented in Fig. 
In general, the study observed that the watershed communities are sufficiently aware of changes in natural resources and changes related to infrastructure development. Moreover, the usage of older respondents (!21 years), of which half had lived in the watershed throughout the period under review for LULC changes, yielded an accurate historical account of LULC changes in the watershed, corroborating the observed LULC trends interpreted from remotely sensed data in the period of 1980-2020. This local attention to LULC changes including infrastructure development can provide valuable input for government strategies to execute a suitable spatial plan for the watershed. Combining LULC maps with local perceptions of LULC changes enables enhanced interpre- Note: The bold and italicized entries along the diagonal represent the LULC areal coverages that remained unchanged between 1980 and 2020. tation of the land use information, which can help the government to develop a spatial plan that considers socio-economic and ecological circumstances and engages local people in decision-making.

## Ranked drivers of land use and land cover changes in the watershed ##
The survey identified 11 major proximate/direct drivers of LULC change in the watershed (Table 
Concerning the underlying/indirect drivers, that is the forces that indirectly trigger the proximate causes 
In the survey, approximately 95% agreed that the population of the area has increased over the period under review, which corroborated with population data that indicate that the population of the Migori County where the watershed is situated has grown by 
Poverty is pervasive in the Kenyan Lake Victoria Basin in which the Migori River watershed occurs, as most households live below the poverty line 
Due to the high poverty levels, about 93% of the watershed households use three-stone open fire for cooking (Table 
Although weak government policies regarding natural resources conservation didn't come out strongly among the top underlying drivers of LULC changes in the watershed identified by the survey, weak law enforcement did; which implies that appropriate government policies are in place but their enforcement is weak and ineffective and therefore may not curtail unsustainable land management practices. The various protected areas such as forest blocks, wetlands, cultural sites, and water sources in the watershed are governed by various government policies developed over the years such as the Environmental Management and Conservation Act 1999 (which mandates environmental management with the goal of attaining sustainable land-based natural resources like forests, wetlands, and water catchment landscapes), Forest Conservation and Management Act 2016 (which provides for the establishment, protection, conservation, and sustainable utilization and management of forests and forest resources for maintenance and conservation of water catchment areas), Water Act 2016 (which tackles the. utilization of water resources to meet human and animal needs, the sustainable management protection of watershed ecosystems), and Land Act 2012 (which emphasizes sustainable conservation, management, and protection of land resources including critical biodiversity, forests, and fragile ecosystems), and Wildlife Conservation and Management Act 2013 (provides for the sustainable protection, conservation, and management of water catchment areas including forests and wetlands existing within the game parks, reserves and protected areas). These government policies generally prohibit logging for timber or deforestation for fuel wood collection, settlement, or agricultural expansion within these protected areas, the government has been lax in providing the enforcement required to curtail such practices from continuing in the watershed, which may be due to the recognition of the high poverty levels experienced by the rapidly growing population. Therefore law enforcement continues to be an important trigger for these anthropogenic-induced causes of LULC changes.

## Household-level logistic regression of perceived drivers of land use and land cover changes ##
Logistic regression analysis was carried out to determine the drivers of LULC changes at the household level in the Migori River watershed (Table 

## Conclusions and recommendations ##
The study established that the major land use in the watershed during the period under review is cultivated land with an average of 61.44% overall coverage of the total land area during the entire period hence the livelihoods of the watershed inhabitants have been historically agriculture-dependent. The decline in shrub lands by 40.63%, grasslands by 84.86%, forests by 52.90%, water by 82.03%, and wetlands by 38.44%; coupled with increased cultivated land by 34.25%, bare land by 132.28%, and built-up areas by 461.20% over the period under review indicate that the natural landscapes in the watershed are undergoing destruction at the expense of human settlement and infrastructural developments. Fuel wood collection, timber/pole production, shifting cultivation, agricultural expansion, charcoal production, population pressure, and high poverty level are the topmost drivers perceived by the watershed communities to be contributing to the land use and land cover changes in the watershed. Since all these identified drivers are still active in the watershed, the natural landscapes are likely to decline further, with negative implications on watershed ecosystem services, biodiversity, and community livelihoods. Gen- erally, the study observed that the watershed communities are sufficiently aware of changes in natural resources and changes related to infrastructure development. This local attention to land use and land cover changes including infrastructure development can provide valuable input for government strategies to execute a suitable spatial plan for the watershed. Integration of spatial LULC analysis with local perceptions of LULC changes enables enhanced interpretation of the land use information, which can help the government to develop a spatial plan that considers socio-economic and ecological circumstances and engages local people in decision-making.
The paper recommends land use zoning on the watershed area to demarcate land areas into settlement areas, conservation, and protected areas, and agricultural lands as well as regulate physical development and use of fragile conservation areas like forests, wetlands, and water sources. Efforts should be directed towards the adoption of alternative cooking energy types by watershed households to reduce the overall demand for fuel wood and consequently ease pressure on forests. The government should also harmonize the existing conservation policies to align them with the interests and priorities of the local watershed communities to balance competing goals for effective management and conservation of the watershed.
