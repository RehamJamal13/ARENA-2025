ABSTRACT:
The increasing urbanisation trend over the decades has resulted in the rapid transformation of land use and land cover (LULC) patterns worldwide. One of the significant consequences of such an uncontrolled conversion process is on the environmental quality (EQ) of the regions, which needs to be addressed. Hence, the present study attempts to derive the environmental quality index (EQI) to measure the impact of LULC along a rapidly urbanising region. The study was divided into three phases. Firstly, the relevant variables were systematically identified from the literature and screened based on relevance, redundancy, context, and scale of the study. The variables then were finalised based on data availability and expert suggestions. The selected variables were grouped under biophysical, LULC, and socio-economic domains. Secondly, using remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques, LULC analysis was performed and the bio-physical variables were processed. The LULC maps (with five classes: water body, settlements, hill, forest, and agriculture) were prepared for the study region for 2000, 2009, and 2019 from Landsat images using a supervised classification algorithm. The LULC analysis showed an increase in the settlement over the past two decades. The relationship between the bio-physical indicators, namely, land surface temperature (LST), normalised difference vegetation index, and normalised difference built-up index (NDBI), was also established to examine the general perception that the increase in urbanisation is one of the main causes for the increase in LST of a region.

With the increase in sprawl and urbanisation in cities, LULC change detection has become the key objective of any urban planning study 
Variable selection, weighting, and aggregation are the essential and challenging elements of EQI construction 
In this study, we seek to address mainly three research questions: (1) With the increasing urbanisation rate in the region under study, has there been a considerable change in LULC over the past two decades? (2) Is the increase in urbanisation one of the reasons for the increase in LST. (3) Does the LULC change influence the EQ of a region? The first research question is addressed by conducting a LULC change analysis of the study region for the years 2000, 2009, and 2019. The second question is attempted to be answered by performing a correlation analysis of the LST with the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and NDBI of the study region for the three years. The final question is to evaluate the influence of LULC change on the EQ of a region by constructing an EQI involving the LULC classes, biophysical indicators, and socio-economic indicators. In the present study, the entropy method of weighting is used. Finally, EQI scores are represented in the form of a spatial map that can be used for making further interpretations and suggestions for improvement.

## Materials and methods ##


## Study region ##
The study region is Ernakulam, one of the districts
Ernakulam was taken as the case study region because of its highest decadal increase in urbanisation rate (68.07% according to the Census of India 2011 data) (Praveen-Sajini 2018). Kochi, which is the commercial, industrial, and financial capital of Kerala, is situated in this district and has the best connectivity through air routes, railways, and road networks, thus making it the most promising economically developed region. The effects of LULC transformations on the EQ was addressed by taking this case study, thereby rendering it truly representative for showcasing the impacts of urbanisation on the environment. The study region consists of 97 local bodies (LBs) 2 , which are the units of analysis in the present work. 

## Variable selection ##
After the delineation/selection of the study area, the next step in the EQI construction (Figure 
Figure 
The first category, bio-physical variables, are most commonly used as proxy variables to indicate the importance of vegetation and the effect of built-up areas on EQ 

## Collection of data ##
Primary and secondary data were used in the study. The primary data comprised satellite images downloaded from the Earth Explorer interface developed by the United States Geological Survey 
Table 

## LULC analysis ##
The details of the LULC classification are critical for the various aspects of urban planning. For example, LULC information is required for land development, regular monitoring and evaluation of land use, environmental planning and management, construction activities, and landscape development. LULC change has a large impact on the environmental status of a region or an area. When a particular type of land cover is converted into another land use type, then its effects tend to be accumulative 
Studies over the past decades [e.g. 
For the analysis, the satellite images were first pre-processed for geo-referencing, atmospheric correction, and radiometric correction 
The pre-processed Landsat images were opened in ArcMap10.5 software for the LULC classification. The supervised classification method was employed to categorise the pixels into suitable LULC classes. Maximum likelihood classification was adopted by collecting more than 100 training samples/regions for each class. Signature files for each class were created. The satellite images were categorised into five different LULC classes, namely, water body, settlements, forest, hill, and agriculture 

## Accuracy assessment ##
Accuracy of the classified LULC was assessed by using an error matrix and Kappa coefficient 
The accuracy parameters included overall accuracy, user's accuracy, producer's accuracy, and Kappa coefficient 

## Extraction of LST, NDVI, and NDBI ##
For the extraction of LST, thermal bands 6 and 10 were used for Landsat 7 and Landsat 8, respectively. LST retrieval was carried out in ArcGIS 10.5. The process involved a series of steps 
(i) Conversion of DN to at-sensor spectral radiance The satellite image contains information in the form of DN. Hence, it was converted to at-sensor spectral radiance [equation (1)] using the spatial analysis tool in ArcGIS. Lℷ = ML * Q cal + AL (1) where Lℷ = spectral radiance at sensor's aperture (in W m -2 sr -1 µm -1 ); ML = bandspecific multiplicative rescaling factor from Landsat metadata; AL = band-specific additive rescaling factor from Landsat metadata; and Q cal = Level 1 pixel value in DN.
(ii) Conversion of radiance into TOA brightness temperature In the second step of extraction, thermal calibration was carried out, which involved the conversion of spectral radiance to TOA brightness temperature using equation ( 
(2) where TB = TOA brightness temperature (℃); Lℷ = spectral radiance at sensor's aperture (in W m -2 sr -1 µm -1 ); and K 1 , K 2 = Thermal conversion constants for the bands.
(iii) Conversion of TOA brightness temperature into LST In the final step, the TOA brightness temperature was converted to LST using equations ( 
For Landsat 7, NDVI = float (Band 4 -Band 3) / float (Band 4 + Band 3) (6) For Landsat 8, NDVI = float (Band 5 -Band 4) / float (Band 5 + Band 4) (7) NDBI is an indicator to extract built-up pixels from satellite images. To extract NDBI from the Landsat images, shortwave infrared and near-infrared bands were used [equations ( 
For Landsat 7, NDBI = float (Band 5 -Band 4) / float (Band 5 + Band 4) (8) For Landsat 8, NDBI = float (Band 6 -Band 5) / float (Band 6+ Band 5) (9)

## Relationship between NDVI and LST vs NDBI and LST ##
The variation of NDVI and NDBI with LST for all three years 
Adjusted R 2 values were also calculated to measure the proportion of the dependent variable (i.e. LST) explained by the independent variables (i.e. NDVI and NDBI) (Pal-Ziaul 2017). Adjusted R 2 value ranges between 0 and 1, with higher values representing a good fit of the model (Pal-Ziaul 2017).

## Construction of EQI ##
Variable selection and data collection were explained previously. For the data matrix formation, the LULC classes and bio-physical variables (LST, NDVI, and NDBI) were processed from satellite images as explained previously. The data were collected for each observation unit of the study area. Data exploration was carried out and weighting the variables was performed using the entropy technique. The weighted variables were aggregated and an EQ score/index was obtained for each unit. Finally, the obtained scores were mapped spatially with the GIS techniques, and the EQI map for the study region was created. The detailed explanation of each stage of index construction is explained in the subsequent sections.

## Initial data exploration ##
In the present study, after completion of the extraction and collection of data for all the selected variables, the data matrix was created with the units of observations on the rows and the variables on the columns 

## Weighting and aggregation ##
After summarising the main characteristics of the dataset, the next step was to give weights to each variable. In this study, the objective method is selected for weighting. The entropy method of weighting, in which, the higher is the difference between the values of each variable, the higher is the preference given to the corresponding variable 

## Sensitivity analysis ##
Sensitivity analysis is important in spatio-temporal models 
The output model may be affected by various error sources, and thus, the accuracy of the model can be checked by using this analysis 
(12) where W(v m , p) is the new value of the m th variable when it is changed by p%; W(v m , 0) is the weight of the m th variable at its base run; W(v i , p) is the weight of the other variables when the m th variable alone is changed; and W(v i , 0) is the weight of the other variable at its base run.

## Results ##


## LULC change detection and analysis ##
LULC classification of the study region for 2000, 2009, and 2019 was carried out using the maximum likelihood classification method (Figure 

## Accuracy assessment ##
Accuracy assessment was performed by comparing the classified LULC image with the ground truth observation (reference image). Stratified random sampling was adopted by selecting 250 random points on the ground (50 points per LULC class) using GPS survey (Figure 
Thermal bands of the Landsat images were employed for extracting LST, NDVI, and NDBI and were derived using red, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared bands, as explained previously. The spatial mapping of LST of the study region showed that the average temperature prevalent in the LBs had increased from 22.5℃ in 2000 to 39℃ in 2019 (Figure 
The relationship of LST with NDVI and NDBI is presented in Tables 
The variation is evident from the LULC change in the study area for the two decades, as explained previously. The correlation between the two groups of variables was better represented in the form of scatter plots (Figure 

## Construction of EQI ##

## Discussion ##
The LULC change analysis was performed for the study region for the years 2000, 2009, and 2019. Five classes of LULC, namely water, settlements, forest, hill, and agriculture, were analysed. The results illustrated that till 2000, the percentage of area covered by settlements was very low. Later, with the increase in construction and developmental activities, such as industrial setups, service sectors, metro rail, and the opening of the container terminal, the settlement percentage increased. By contrast, the agricultural area has drastically declined over the decades primarily due to increasing population density, the shift in the occupational structure of the people from the primary sector to secondary and tertiary sectors 
The study further investigated some of the impacts of the LULC change in the study region by assessing the correlation between LST, NDVI, and NDBI. The results show that from 2000 to 2019, LST recorded a sharp increase in its Celsius values, mainly due to the increase in settlement patterns. The buildings and the development of other non-pervious surfaces have contributed to the rising temperature. At the same time, the NDVI and NDBI values showed a decreasing and increasing trend, respectively, for the same decadal change. The most evident reason for this change is the construction and development activities that occurred in the study region. Additionally, the correlation analysis confirmed that the LST increases with the increase in NDBI, whereas it decreases with the increase in NDVI 
The EQI spatial map of the study region showed that the identified poor and very poor EQ regions, which are distributed in the western part, have majority settlement characteristics, low NDVI, and high NDBI and LST values. Most of the industrial setups, ports, and container terminal are also situated here, which also contributes to the poor EQ of the region. The eastern part of the study region consists mainly of hills and forest areas, which primarily contribute to better EQ. The hills or natural resources restrict the construction or development activities, as evident from the research performed by 

## Planning interventions ##
This study focused on the current impacts on the EQ of a region because of the increasing urbanisation trend by constructing an index. The analysis of LULC helps in the planning interventions at the city level. The present study can contribute to the knowledge of development control regulations, provision of better transportation corridors in the region, proper management of sprawl development, and diminution of urban heat island effect 
This study can also offer insight into the improvement in EQ and sustainability of coastal areas where these have been adversely impacted by the LULC changes 

## Conclusions ##
This study investigated the estimation of LULC change for the years
