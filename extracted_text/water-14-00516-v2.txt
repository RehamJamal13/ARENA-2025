ABSTRACT:
The Appalachian Mountain region of eastern Kentucky is unique and contains high proportions of forestland along with coal and natural gas depositaries. Landscape changes due to extreme mining activities can eventually threaten the downstream ecosystems, including soil and water quality, resulting in excessive runoff and sedimentation. The purpose of this study is to assess the impacts of land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes in streamflow and sediment yield in Yellow Creek Watershed, Kentucky, USA, between 1992 and 2016. LULC, digital elevation model, soil, and weather data were inputted into the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate discharge and sediment yield. The model output was evaluated on several statistical parameters, such as the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR), percent bias (PBIAS), and the coefficient of determination (R 2 ). In addition, two indices, P-factor and R-factor, were used to measure the prediction uncertainty. The calibrated model showed an increase in surface runoff and sediment yield due to changes in LULC in the Yellow Creek Watershed. The results provided important insights for studying water management strategies to make more informed land management decisions and adaptive practices.

## Introduction ##
Land-use and land-cover (hereafter LULC) change is a phenomenon that has been taking place since the beginning of humankind. It has long been considered a factor affecting the global environment 
Various anthropogenic activities have played an important role in landscape changes in the Appalachian Mountains region. Surface mining has been one of the major activities since World War II, resulting in a significant alteration in the mountain landscapes with the transformation of native forests and their associated soils into heavily disturbed mine lands 
It has become necessary to study the temporal and spatial variations in hydrological balance and to understand the mechanisms of influence behind LULC change impacts. However, it is impossible to measure every component of the hydrological system due mainly to watershed heterogeneity and inadequate measuring tools 
In the United States, SWAT is increasingly being used to study in-stream processes 
Considering the void that exists in the literature, this study provides a case study from the Yellow Creek Watershed, a small critical watershed in eastern Kentucky that has been heavily impacted by coal-mining activities but supports local livelihoods and the ecosystem within and around the Appalachian Mountains region. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of LULC changes on streamflow and sediment yield between 1992 and 2016. The Yellow Creek Watershed is particularly of interest to this study due to past and ongoing surface mining and reclamation activities as a major LULC change in the region (See Figure 

## Materials and Methods ##


## Description of the Study Region ##
The Yellow Creek Watershed falls within the Upper Cumberland River basin. The watershed is primarily located in Bell County, Kentucky, but extends into Claiborne County, Tennessee. The outlet of this watershed corresponds to the point where a monitoring station (USGS 03402000) is installed, which is at Yellow Creek near Middlesboro (latitude: 36 • 40 05 , longitude: 83 • 41 19 ) (Figure 

## The SWAT Model ##
The SWAT model is a physically based, watershed-scale simulation model jointly developed by the USDA Agricultural Research Service and Texas A&M AgriLife Research, part of the Texas A&M University System 
where SW t is the final soil water content on day i, SW 0 is the initial soil water content on day i, t is the time in days, R day is the amount of rainfall on day i, Q surf is the amount of surface runoff on day i, E a is the amount of evapotranspiration on day i, W seep is the amount of water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile on day i, and Q gw is the amount of base flow or return flow on day i.
The surface runoff was estimated by using the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Soil Conservation Services (SCS) runoff curve number (CN) approach 
where Q surf is the accumulated runoff or rainfall access, R day is the rainfall depth of the day (mm H 2 O), I a is the initial abstractions, which includes surface storage, interception and infiltration prior to runoff (mm H 2 O), and S is the retention parameter (mm H 2 O). The retention parameter (S) is dependent spatially to changes in soils, land use, management, and slope, and temporarily to changes in soil water content 
where CN is the curve number for the day. The initial abstraction, I a , is usually approximated as 0.2S, so equation 2 can be rewritten as
The SWAT offers three methods to estimate potential evapotranspiration (PET): the Penman-Monteith method, the Priestley-Taylor method, and the Hargreaves method 
where λE is the latent heat flux density (MJ m -2 d -1 ), E is the depth rate evaporation (mm d -1 ), ∆ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure-temperature curve, de/dT (kPa • C -1 ), H net is the net radiation (MJ m -2 d -1 ), G is the heat flux density to the ground (MJ m -2 d -1 ), ρ air is the air density (kg m -3 ), c p is the specific heat at constant pressure (MJ kg -1 • C -1 ), e 0 z is the saturation vapor pressure of air at height z (kPa), e z is the water vapor pressure of air at height z (kPa), γ is the psychometric constant (kPa • C -1 ), r c is the plant canopy resistance (s m -1 ), and r a is the diffusion resistance of the air layer (aerodynamic resistance) (s m -1 ) 
The sediment component for each HRU was calculated using the modified universal soil loss equation (MUSLE). The MUSLE [51] is
where sed is the sediment yield on a given day (metric tons), Q surf is the surface runoff volume (mm H 2 O/ha), q peak is the peak runoff rate (m 3 /s), area hru is the area of HRU (ha), K USLE is the USLE soil erodibility factor (0.013 metric ton m 2 hr/m 3   

## Hydro-Climatic Data ##
Table 
LOADEST uses three statistical estimation methods for the calibration 

## SWAT Model Setup ##
ArcSWAT 2012, an ArcGIS extension and interface for SWAT, was used to simulate the SWAT model. ArcSWAT interface is a public domain software, and as such may be used freely 
A threshold critical source area of 350 ha (between the suggested range by ArcGIS watershed delineation interface) was used for this study, which divided the watershed into 21 sub-basins (Figure 

## SWAT-CUP Premium and SWAT Parameter Estimator (SPE) Algorithm ##
We used SWAT-CUP Premium (SWAT-CUPP), a computer program developed for calibration of the SWAT model (https://www.2w2e.com/home/SwatCupPremium; accessed on 17 February 2021). SWAT-CUPP is an improved version of SWAT-CUP, which allows for behavioral and multi-objective calibration 
SWAT-CUPP offers two algorithms, SWAT Parameter Estimator (SPE) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We used the SPE algorithm (previously Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2)) for model sensitivity analysis, calibration, uncertainty analysis, and validation 
where Y obs i is the ith observation for the constituent being evaluated, Y sim i is the ith simulated value for the constituent being evaluated, Y mean i is the mean of observed data for the constituent being evaluated, and n is the total number of observations 

## Model Sensitivity Analysis ##
Sensitivity analysis is the foremost step in the calibration and validation process in SWAT-CUPP, which determines the most sensitive parameters for a given watershed 
One-at-a-time sensitivity analysis was conducted for each parameter while keeping other parameter values constant 
where g denotes the objective function, b is the parameter, α is the regression constant, β corresponds to the technical coefficient attached to the variable b, and m is the number of parameters 
In addition, statistical measurements t-stat and p-value were used to identify the sensitive parameters, with larger t-stats and smaller p-values representing greater sensitivity. Based on one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis, Abbaspour et al. 
The results of global sensitivity analysis after the first iteration are listed in Table 

## Model Calibration and Uncertainty Analysis ##
The second step is model calibration, in which parameter value ranges are adjusted to improve the fit between model predictions and real-world observations 
Calibration is characteristically subjective and, therefore, closely linked to model output uncertainty 
where k is the number of observed data points, l is a counter and X L (2.5th) and X U (97.5th) represent the lower and upper boundaries of the 95PPU 
where σ X is the standard deviation of the measured variable X. The P-factor value of >0.7 (at least 70%) and R-factor value of <1.5 (at most 150%) are desirable and recommended to be adequate 

## Model Validation ##
After calibration, the model is validated with the calibrated parameter ranges and by comparing predictions to additional observed data, which is not used for calibration. Based on the level of agreement between predictions and the additional observations, the model is validated for further use, or model inputs and parameters are revisited for further calibration 
The initial model obtained from ArcSWAT was divided into two periods, 1990-1997 for calibration and 1998-2004 for validation in SWAT-CUPP. Discharge was calibrated first since it is the primary controlling variable 
Parallel processing was utilized to speed up the calibration process. The parallel processing module utilized all eight CPUs where, for each iteration, 600 simulations were divided into eight simultaneous runs of 75 each per CPU. This substantially improved the runtime of the calibration and validation process 

## Model Performance Indices ##
In addition to two indices used for prediction uncertainty analysis, P-factor and R-factor, multiple indices are made available to check the performance of the SWAT model 

## Results ##


## Model Calibration, Uncertainty Analysis, and Validation ##
After performing three iterations (600 simulations in each) with modifications to the parameters, the model was observed to have a good fit between the observed and simulated discharge and between the LOADEST-simulated and SWAT-simulated sediment. The statistical results of the model performance for discharge and sediment during both calibration and validation periods are summarized in Table

As illustrated in Table

## Discussion ##
The resulting statistics of our study were acceptable based on the guidelines 
The results from this study imply that LULC modification might have a significant impact on the annual water balance in the watershed. The decline in percolation, lateral flow, and groundwater might be mainly due to changes in LULC and altered soil properties due to coal-mining activities in the watershed. Similarly, increased runoff indicated the lower infiltration capacity of the surface. Evidence from previous studies also suggests the historical LULC change impact in basin-scale water balance, such as with the Raccoon River Watershed in Iowa 
Our findings are consistent with previous studies that suggest increasing sediment yields, water quality degradation, and increasing flood events pertaining to LULC changes 
Several studies show higher peak and total storm runoff from mined lands compared to forested lands in the Appalachian region 
SWAT is an effective and widely accepted tool in predicting the impact of LULC changes 

## Conclusions ##
This study was successful in simulating sediment yield and quantifying the impact of LULC change on the hydrology of the watershed. The results showed a very good agreement between observed and predicted discharge and sediment at the outlet. The results showed that the Yellow Creek Watershed experienced LULC changes over 25 years between 1992 and 2016. It consisted primarily of a decrease in forest cover which mostly converted into coal-mine lands, urban development, and growth in pastureland. Similarly, the comparison of the distribution of water balance components, sediment yield, and LULC changes in the watershed implied that LULC changes, specifically ongoing surface mining activities, increasing pastureland, and urban development, have contributed to augmenting the sediment yield in the watershed.
This study contributes to studying land management practices in watersheds impaired by coal-mine operations. Addressing impacts of LULC change issues strategically and timely is essential for the effective management of coal-mine lands and water resources. Identifying critical areas and selecting best management practices (BMPs) in watershed scale are necessary for reducing sedimentation. The BMPs in watershed scale, for example, should focus on approaches for reducing the environmental footprints of mining by implementing reclamation practices that are feasible in the watershed.
Despite model and data limitations, this study fills the gap that exists in modeling LULC impacts on water and land management in the coal-mine lands of the Appalachian region in Kentucky. The findings presented provide a plethora of information on LULC changes and their impact on hydrology. The maps and tables produced in this study provide essential spatial information on the sub-basin scale to researchers in identifying and implementing appropriate land management practices.
There is a dearth of systematic research and data to quantify the effects of coal-mine lands on increased surface runoff and sediment yield. This research is a case study modeling impacts of LULC on runoff and sediment yield. We recommend continuing similar studies in the other watersheds to discern the role of change in LULC on runoff and sediment yield using high-resolution land cover data and integrating such data with human populations and infrastructure changes such as access roads to coal mine areas. Future studies should include local rainfall characteristics and evapotranspiration data. Rainfall patterns and their impacts on coal-field areas will be important to study in this region.
In future studies, this approach can further be utilized in other similar watersheds to explore the impacts of surface-mining activities on the hydrological properties and to evaluate the effectiveness of best management practices (BMPs) in managing sediment yields for environmental stewardship at the watershed level. We will expand this research to include other watersheds from the Appalachian region to explore the impacts of land-use change on water discharge, as well as the effects of current agricultural and forestry-related BMPs in sediment control and management.
