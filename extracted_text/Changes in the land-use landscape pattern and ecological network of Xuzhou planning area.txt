ABSTRACT:
Ongoing rapid urbanization has triggered significant changes in land use, rendering landscape patterns adversely impacted and certain habitat patches degraded. Ecological networks have consequently contracted overall. As such, an investigation into how land-use landscape patterns and ecological networks change over time and space is of major significance for ecological restoration and regional sustainability. Taking Xuzhou Planning Area as a case study, we examined spatiotemporal changes and features of the landscape pattern by employing the land-use change degree, the landuse transition matrix, and quantified landscape pattern indices. An ecological network analysis, which studies the changes in network connectivity and robustness, as well as their causes and contributors, was undertaken to probe into the features and trends of spatiotemporal changes in the land-use landscape pattern and ecological network amid expeditious urbanization. Analysis results unveiled the following: (1) From 1985 to 2020, there was a decline in the area of farmland, forest, and grassland, accompanied by an increase in land for construction, water bodies, and unused land. The southwestern research area witnessed farmland substantially give way to land for construction for this period, and the most dramatic change in land use occurred between 2000 and 2010. (2) The area of dominant patches in the research area shrank, along with more fragmented, complex landscapes. The land for construction was emerging as the dominant landscape by area, whereas patches of farmland, forest, grassland, and water bodies became less connected. (3) The ecological network was densely linked in the northeast, with sparser connections in the southwest. Spatial shrinkage was observed in the research area's southwestern and central ecological corridors. Overall, the number of ecological sources and corridors rose and subsequently dropped before a rebound. (4) The ecological network grew more connected and robust from 1985 through 1990, as portions of farmland were converted into water bodies, which led to an increase in ecological sources. Given a reduction in ecological sources and corridors in the southwestern and central regions between 1990 and 2010, network connectivity and robustness declined, which was reversed from 2010 onward with the addition of two ecological sources-Pan'an Lake and Dugong Lake. With an optimal ecological network in 1990, however, it deteriorated significantly by 2010. The research area saw the minimum value of its network connectivity indices of network stability index (α), evenness index (β), and connectivity index (γ), in 2010, when its ecological network was highly fragmented and vulnerable, attributing to a strong contrast between the maximal connected subgraph's relative size and connectivity robustness. The research findings can lay scientific groundwork for addressing ecological issues, restoring landscape patterns, and developing ecological networks amid urbanization.

## Untitled ##
Presently, a large majority of global research efforts on land use landscape patterns and ecological networks have been made from individual perspectives. On landscape patterns, prior studies focused on examining either the features of spatiotemporal changes concerning all types of the land use landscape through the dynamic degree of land use and land-use transition matrix, metrics derived from land use change 
Employing the Landsat program's remote sensing data spanning from 1985 to 2020, we endeavored to elucidate the trends and features of spatiotemporal changes in the landscape pattern and ecological network of the Xuzhou Planning Area. The effort was facilitated by analyzing land-use change and landscape pattern indices and applying ecological network research methods. Commencing with a rigorous exploration of land-use change, this study adopted quantitative measures, including the land-use change degree, the land-use transition matrix, and landscape pattern indices, to discern the intricate spatiotemporal changing trends and characteristics encompassing the urban landscape pattern. Subsequently, the MSPA-InVEST-Conefor model was harnessed to identify ecological sources, before developing an ecological network grounded on the MCR model and under circuit theory. Through the lens of network stability index (α), evenness index (β), and connectivity index (γ) 

## Research area overview and data sources ##


## Research area overview ##
Situated in the northwest of Jiangsu Province and the southeast of the North China Plain, Xuzhou represents a strategically significant city in the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative and a national innovation demonstration zone for sustainable development. Plains and hills account for about 90% and 10% of the city's total area, respectively. The hilly area's altitude ranges from 100 to 200 m, with the highest peak represented by Dadong Mountain nestled at the heart of Jiawang District, at 361 m. Home to a permanent population of 9.03 million, Xuzhou fosters a robust urbanization rate of 66.19%, and its GDP stood impressively at Renminbi 811.74 billion as of the end of 2021. Factoring in the city's overarching developmental imperatives and the spatial layout of its landscape pattern and ecological network, we took the Xuzhou Planning Area as our research area, which included downtown Xuzhou and Shuanggou Town in Suining County, as illustrated in Fig.

## Conclusions ##
Built on multi-source remote sensing imagery for the years 1985, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020, the paper investigated the features and trends of spatiotemporal changes in the landscape pattern and ecological network of Xuzhou Planning Area by leveraging the land-use model, landscape pattern indices, and ecological network analysis. Research findings offer guidance for addressing the issue of urban eco-space shrinkage and fragmentation, better preserving ecological resources in the research area, and promoting sustainable urban development.
Major conclusions were drawn as follows:
(1) Xuzhou Planning Area has undergone a dramatic transformation in the land-use landscape pattern amid urbanization. Between 1985 and 2020, the continuous expansion of land for construction notably encroached upon surrounding farmland, resulting in the conversion of certain ecological land, including forests and grasslands, into construction areas. Over the 35-year period, there was a significant increase in the area of land for construction by 303.08 km The indices of SHDI and SHEI, however, increased throughout the research period, from 0.92 and 0.51 up to 1.02 and 0.57, respectively. These readings suggested that the dominant patch area in landscapes is on a declining trend, accompanied by enhanced ecological spatial heterogeneity and increased fragmentation and complexity of landscapes. At the patch level, the land for construction is steadily enhancing its role as the largest dominant landscape type, and the fragmented invasion of land for construction in the suburbs of cities has caused a reduction and fragmentation of farmland, posing a threat to the quality of habitats and landscape layout such as forests, grasslands, and water bodies.This trend leads to loosely connected patches of these land types. (3) The overall ecological network in the research area grew dense in the northeast and sparse in the southwest characterized by intense human activity. Between 1985 and 2020, the number of ecological sources and corridors rose and subsequently dropped before a rebound. The total area of ecological sources decreased by 8.06 km 2 , despite an increase in number, from 19 to 20. At the same time, the number of corridors rose from 47 to 49, but despite this increase, the combined length was shortened by 120.23 km. Landscapes became better connected for the period from 1985 to 1990, with potions of farmland converted into water areas and an addition of three ecological sources and eight corridors. With an expansion of land for construction in the southwest during the period from 1990 to 2010, the overall number of ecological patches became smaller, thus compromising landscape connectivity and disrupting the ecological landscape pattern. From 2010 onward, landscape connectivity was enhanced as attention was paid to restoring ecosystems, together with a conversion of some farmland portions into water areas and the addition of two ecological sources and seven corridors. On the whole, the northeastern region with dense forest patches had stronger landscape connectivity. The strength of landscape connectivity was correlated with changes in ecological sources, as the expansion of land for construction led to a shrinkage of ecological source areas and corridors in the densely populated southwest, which was unfavorable for material and information exchange and biodiversity conservation in the research area. (4) Over the period from 1985 to 1990, three ecological sources and eight corridors were added, enhancing the connectivity of ecological patches and complicating the ecological network. However, between 1990 and 2010, the spatial distribution of corridors in the southwestern and central research area shrank, resulting in a decline in network connectivity and robustness. Starting from 2010, the addition of two ecological sources, namely Dugong Lake and Pan'an Lake, increased the density of corridors in the central and northeastern research area, thus changing network connectivity and robustness for the better. Overall, the ecological network was most optimal in 1990, with a more even spatial distribution between its source areas, better ensuring the resilience of the ecological network to external disruptions. Followed by 2000, 2020, 1985, and 2010. By 2010, the maximal connected subgraph's relative size and connectivity robustness exhibited significant fluctuations and differences. And the α, β, and γ indices hit their minimum values of 0.81, 2.33, and 0.875, respectively, indicating that during this period, the period witnessed the most fragmented ecological network, characterized by heightened vulnerability upon disruptions.

## Discussions ##
In this paper, we delved into land-use landscape patterns changes and transitions in the Xuzhou Planning Area spanning from 1985 through 2020 and produced an ecological network of the research area. Subsequently, we conducted a thorough assessment of network connectivity and resilience, examining the dynamic evolution attributes of the ecological network structure through a prolonged temporal lens and identifying key recovery zones within the landscape schema. Analysis results showed that there were pronounced differences between southwestern and northeastern research regions in terms of the number of ecological corridors and nodes.
Another observation was that the ecological network in the northeastern Jiawang District was denser than that in the southwestern research area characterized by intense human activity. This was attributed to the continuous expansion of land for construction in the central urban areas of the southwestern region, with fragmentation encroaching on surrounding farmland and core ecological patches of forest, grassland, and water bodies.
Consequently, this has resulted in the contraction of ecological patches and corridors in the southwestern area, propelling the overall landscape towards a trajectory of increased fragmentation and complexity. The inadequate connectivity among patches impedes the exchange of substrates, information, and biodiversity conservation within the study domain. Authorities should avoid allowing uncontrolled construction in these areas if they are to meet the national goal of maintaining habitat connectivity and fostering sustainable urban-rural development. There should be a focus on amplifying ecological restoration and protection initiatives in the southwestern region, rigorously controlling the unplanned expansion and sprawl of construction land, while also intensifying efforts to conserve and connect farmland and core ecological patches of forest, grassland, and water bodies. This includes the establishment of ecological corridors amidst patches, thereby enhancing ecosystem stability and bolstering landscape integration. Nonetheless, certain limitations in this paper warrant consideration. First, different topographic and geomorphic features in the research area were not factored in during the creation of the complex network, which impeded a further exploration of the interplay between network robustness with ecological nodes under attack and the impact of natural elements in the research area. Second, the processes of extracting ecological sources and weighting ecological resistance factors were primarily drawn from prior research and findings, which entails a qualitative analysis framework. For now, a comprehensive and unified quantitative analytical paradigm for research on ecological networks remains absent. Overcoming these limitations would be instrumental in further complementing the research literature on the structures and features of spatial ecological networks.
