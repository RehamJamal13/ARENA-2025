Title: Predicting changes in land use/land cover and seasonal land surface temperature using multi-temporal landsat images in the northwest region of Bangladesh

Abstract: Configurations of LULC and seasonal LST change in the Northwest region of Bangladesh were analyzed. Built-up area expansion contributed to increased summer and winter LST by 0.55 C and 2.54 C per decade from 1999-2019. Temperature increases have resulted in a significant decline in agricultural productivity over the last 30 years. Summer and winter LST simulations indicate that more than 50 % and 13 % will likely be in >35 C by 2039. Prediction of LULC change and seasonal LST variation needs to be considered during urban development plans.
