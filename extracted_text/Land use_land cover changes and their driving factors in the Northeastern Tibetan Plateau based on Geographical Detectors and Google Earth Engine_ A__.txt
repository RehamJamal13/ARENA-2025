ABSTRACT:
As an important production base for livestock and a unique ecological zone in China, the northeast Tibetan Plateau has experienced dramatic land use/land cover (LULC) changes with increasing human activities and continuous climate change. However, extensive cloud cover limits the ability of optical remote sensing satellites to monitor accurately LULC changes in this area. To overcome this problem in LULC mapping in the Ganan Prefecture, 2000-2018, we used the dense time stacking of multi-temporal Landsat images and random forest algorithm based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The dynamic trends of LULC changes were analyzed, and geographical detectors quantitatively evaluated the key driving factors of these changes. The results showed that (1) the overall classification accuracy varied between 89.14% and 91.41%, and the kappa values were greater than 86.55%, indicating that the classification results were reliably accurate. (2) The major LULC types in the study area were grassland and forest, and their area accounted for 50% and 25%, respectively. During the study period, the grassland area decreased, while the area of forest land and construction land increased to varying degrees. The land-use intensity presents multi-level intensity, and it was higher in the northeast than that in the southwest. (3) Elevation and population density were the major driving factors of LULC changes, and economic development has also significantly affected LULC. These findings revealed the main factors driving LULC changes in Gannan Prefecture and provided a reference for assisting in the development of sustainable land management and ecological protection policy decisions.

## Introduction ##
Land use/land cover (LULC) changes are the most basic and prominent landscape characteristic describing the impact of anthropogenic disturbance on the surface of the Earth and play an important role in the studies of regional and global environmental changes 
There are currently great uncertainties and differences among existing global LULC products due to different data sources, methods, and classification systems. Furthermore, most previous studies were concerned about long-term vegetation change on the TP 
However, the processing of multi-source satellite data is a huge challenge for computing capacity. Currently, a free cloud platform provides new methods for geospatial analysis. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) can avoid the process of image downloading and preprocessing and hence greatly improve the efficiency of LULC change research 
The driving force analysis can determine the process of LULC changes and reveal the regional ecological environment change mechanism 
Gannan Prefecture is an important water supply area for the Yellow River, located in the northeast TP. This area plays an important role in conserving water sources, maintaining biodiversity, and regulating climate 
This study applied dense time stacking of Landsat images to monitor LULC changes in Gannan Prefecture and explored its driving factors based on geographical detectors. We aimed to (1) obtain the LULC information of Gannan Prefecture 2000-2018 based on the GEE platform, (2) analyze the spatiotemporal change pattern of land-use intensity in Gannan Prefecture, and (3) identify the main socioeconomic and natural factors affecting LULC changes using geographical detectors. The results are expected to provide theoretical support for adjusting and optimizing land use in Gannan Prefecture.

## Training and Validation Sample Selection ##
The classification system was determined based on current LULC in the Gannan Prefecture and by referring to previous research 
Supervised classification methods require high-quality training and validation samples. Training samples used to create the classification model were collected through visual interpretation and field observations 

## Anthropogenic and Natural Data ##
Because anthropogenic and natural factors profoundly influence LULC changes, 11 potential factors were selected in this study to detect their influence on LULC changes in Gannan Prefecture in 2000, 2009, and 2018 (Figure 
Remote Sens. 2020, 12, x 5 of 18
we collected more than 1323 reference points in 2000, 2009, and 2018, covering seven LULC types (Supplementary Materials Figure

## LULC Classification and Accuracy Assessment ##
We selected a random forest (RF) algorithm as the classifier because it generally has greater processing power for data noise and overfitting 
An accuracy assessment is necessary for LULC classification to explain the correspondence between ground truth and classification results

## Land Use Degree Index ##
Land-use intensity is the most intuitive representation of human activity and can directly reflect the state of LULC 
where La is the land use degree index value; A i is the hierarchical index of land use degree i; C i is the percentage of the graded area of land use degree of category i. According to the previous studies of Zhuang et al. 

## Geographical Detector ##
The geographical detector model is a spatial heterogeneity detection method usually used to quantify the driving force of each factor on the dependent variable 
where q is the explanatory power index of the influencing factors of land use degree. The greater the q value, the greater the effect of the independent variable x on the heterogeneity of land use. N h is the number of samples of the sub-regions h; N is the total sample size; σ and σ 2 denote the total variance and variance of samples in sub-region h, respectively.

## Results ##


## Variable Importance Analysis and Accuracy Assessment of LULC Classification ##
The RF model can analyze the importance of characteristic variables, which improves classification accuracy while reducing data redundancy and processing workload. We used the explain method on the classifier to view the importance of characteristic parameters on the GEE platform. The higher the importance score indicated, the greater the impact and contribution of the variable to the classification results. Our results showed that elevation had the highest importance score among all the characteristic variables; its average value was greater than 1100 (Figure 
Remote Sens. 2020, 12, x 8 of 18 MNDWI, and NDVI followed, and they are more important for the identification of water body and vegetation. The importance score of other characteristic variables for LULC classification remained stable (Figure

## LULC Transformation ##
To observe the changes in various LULC types, we used the spatial analysis method to create the 2000-2018 LULC changes transition matrix and mapped them. From 2000 to 2009, in general, grassland and wetlands decreased, and farmland, forest land, and construction land expanded (Figures 
grassland and wetlands decreased, and farmland, forest land, and construction land expanded (Figures 
Similarly, from 2009 to 2018, the areas of farmland and grassland continued to decrease, while forest land, wetland, and unused land expanded (Figures 
Similarly, from 2009 to 2018, the areas of farmland and grassland continued to decrease, while forest land, wetland, and unused land expanded (Figures 
Comparing the spatial-temporal changes in LULC between 2000-2009 and 2009-2018, we found that the farmland area increased first and then decreased, but the wetland area followed the opposite trend. In general, between 2000-2018, the grassland was continuously degraded, and the area under forest land and construction land gradually increased. The water body area did not change much, and the area of unused land also increased, which was mainly caused by grassland and water body shrinkage.

## Degree of Land Use Change ##
We calculated the dynamic degree of land use based on the LULC dataset of Gannan Prefecture. The spatial changes in land-use intensity represent diversified types and multi-level intensity, and the overall land-use intensity in the northeast was higher than that in the southwest (Figure

## Discussion ##


## Analysis of LULC Classification Variable Importance and Result Verification ##
This study constructed various characteristic variables on the GEE platform and used the RF machine algorithm to classify LULC in Gannan Prefecture. The RF algorithm provides flexibility to include different data types in the modeling process and accurately classifies the LULC heterogeneity 
The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were reasonable, as, according to the USGS survey, the recommended threshold is 85%, and Gashaw et al. 

## Temporal-Spatial Variation of LULC Changes ##
LULC changes are influenced by the interaction between humans and the environment at different spatial and temporal scales. Monitoring LULC changes can help us understand the causes of their dynamic changes, and it supports land management and decision-making 
The change in land-use intensity reflects the disturbance degree of human activities on natural resources 

## Major Drivers of LULC Changes ##
LULC is a complex process affected by natural, social, and economic factors. Here, we explain the driving mechanism of LULC changes by analyzing the relative importance of natural and human disturbances. Generally, LULC changes are greatly affected by human activities. Our results showed that from 2000 to 2018, population density explained much of the LULC changes. This finding agrees with previous reports that the LULC changes driven by human activities are increasing 
LULC changes are also closely related to natural factors 

## Advantages and Limitations of the Current Study ##
The GEE cloud computing platform has unique computing capabilities, free satellite images, integrated APIs, and researchers can process massive geographic data 
Factor detection found that the influence of natural factors on LULC changes in Gannan Prefecture is greater than the influence of the anthropogenic factors, which might be caused by the fragile ecological environment and lack of investment and transportation 

## Conclusions ##
The study used the dense time stacking of multi-temporal Landsat images and the RF machine learning algorithm to map the LULC in Gannan Prefecture, and then analyze potential driving forces based on geographic detectors. Our results demonstrated that from 2000 to 2018, Gannan Prefecture was dominated by grassland, followed by forest land and farmland. Grasslands and wetlands gradually degraded from 2000 to 2018, while forest land, construction land, and unused land expanded. Grassland was mainly converted to forest land. The high land-use intensity was distributed in Lintan, northern Xiahe, and Hezuo. The overall land-use intensity of Gannan Prefecture was higher in the northeast than in the southwest, and these areas are relatively flat, mainly consisting of cultivated land and construction land. In addition, the importance analysis of all variables using the RF model found that elevation was the most important characteristic variable for LULC classification in Gannan Prefecture.
The driving factor analysis also found that elevation was the most important factor affecting the LULC in Gannan Prefecture. However, with economic development, the driving effects of anthropogenic factors on the LULC have gradually expanded. In 2018, population density, GDP, livestock quantity, and chemical fertilizer consumption had an explanatory power exceeding 0.3117 for LULC changes, which indicates that economic development has promoted LULC changes. In conclusion, our study results indicate that elevation restricts the dominant factors of LULC changes in alpine regions. The study provides results that revealed the land use mechanism in the northeastern TP.
