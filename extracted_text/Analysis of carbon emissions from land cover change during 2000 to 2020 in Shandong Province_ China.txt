ABSTRACT:
Land cover change affects the carbon emissions of ecosystems in some way. The qualitative and quantitative understanding of carbon emissions from human activities (e.g., land cover change, industrial production, etc.) is highly significant for realizing the objective of carbon neutrality. Therefore, this paper used GlobeLand30 land cover maps, annual average normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, annual average net ecosystem productivity (NEP) data and statistical yearbook data from 2000 to 2020 to explore the relationship between land cover change and carbon emissions. Specifically, it included land cover change, carbon storage changes influenced by land cover change, spatial and temporal analysis of carbon sources and sinks, land use intensity change and anthropogenic carbon emissions. The results of the study show that the main land cover changes in Shandong province during 2000-2020 was cultivated land conversion to artificial surfaces. Among them, the area of cultivated land converted to artificial surfaces from 2000 to 2010 was 4930.62 km 2 , and the proportion of cultivated land converted to artificial surfaces from 2010 to 2020 was as high as 78.35%. The total carbon stock of vegetation affected by land cover change decreased by 463.96 × 10 4 t and 193.50 × 10 4 t in 2000-2010 and 2010-2020 respectively. The spatial and temporal distribution of carbon sources and sinks differed more markedly from 2000 to 2020, and land use intensity changes in Shandong Province showed an upward trend. Of the total energy production, industry has the largest energy consumption, followed closely by total energy consumption in transportation, storage and postal services.
Phenomena such as global warming, melting glaciers, rising sea levels and hazy weather indicate that climate change brought about by the greenhouse effect is seriously affecting the future survival of mankind 1-3 . The Earth's climate is witnessing changes due to the influence of various factors. In recent years, global warming has become a hot issue for research. Emissions of greenhouse gases, e.g., carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, are regarded as a major contributor to global warming 4-6 . Studies have shown that the global average surface temperature has increased by 0.74 °C since the last century 7 , and atmospheric CO 2 concentrations have increased by up to 1.9 ppm per year 8 . The Global Carbon Budget Project shows that emissions of fossil CO 2 will increase by 0.5% in 2019, with emissions falling in the US and EU28 and increasing in China, India and the rest of the world 9 . With increasing levels of urbanisation and industrialisation, human activities are emitting large amounts of CO 2 into the atmosphere. Of these, land cover change is an important contributor to carbon emissions, making up roughly one-third of the carbon emissions generated by human activities from the industrial revolution 10 , contributing to increasing concentrations of CO 2 . Therefore, the study of the interrelationship between land cover change and carbon emissions is of great importance to further reduce carbon emissions.
The implementation of the reform and opening-up policy has led to a significant acceleration of urbanisation in China, most notably the dramatic expansion of artificial surfaces. Land cover change, energy consumption and other related human activities are the sources of carbon emissions and account for a relatively large share. Rapid economic development and high urbanisation levels in China's cities are hotspots for studying carbon emissions caused by land cover change. For example, Deng et al. analysed the influence of expanding construction land on carbon emissions related to energy in China and its provinces from 2001 to 2011 11 . Lu et al. explored the development process and characteristics of regional differences in carbon emissions from agricultural land in 31

provinces in mainland China from 2000 to 2015 
On 15 September 2020, the 30 m Global Land Cover 2020 remote sensing mapping data was released. The GlobeLand30 data consists of 10 primary types, e.g., cultivated land, forest, grassland, shrub land, wetland, water bodies, artificial surfaces, bare land, etc 
According to the China Emission Accounts and Datasets (CEADs), Shandong Province ranks among the top five provinces in China in terms of total carbon emissions, and is a province with both high total carbon and high carbon intensity 
Therefore, this paper takes Shandong Province as the research object and focuses on four aspects, i.e., land cover change, land cover-influenced carbon storage change, spatial-temporal distribution of carbon sources and sinks, land use intensity change and anthropogenic carbon emissions. Firstly, the amount, rate of change and transfer matrix were explored for land cover using GlobeLand30 maps for 2000, 2010 and 2020. Secondly, carbon stock changes affected by land cover change were analysed according to land cover type. Then, annual average normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) data calculated using remote sensing images and annual average net ecosystem productivity (NEP) data were used for spatial and temporal analysis of carbon sources and sinks. Finally, land use intensity change and anthropogenic carbon emissions were explored with statistical yearbook data, and the above changes were analysed for attribution and recommendations were made accordingly.
The purpose of this paper is to analyse the interactions between land cover change and carbon emissions in Shandong Province from multiple perspectives, and to use the latest land cover data to explore land cover change and carbon emissions in a rational and effective way. The contributions of this paper are as follows. (1) This study provides a comprehensive analysis of land cover change, land use intensity change, and the spatial and temporal distribution of carbon sources and sinks in Shandong Province. (2) This study explores the changes in vegetation carbon storage due to land cover change and anthropogenic carbon emissions in Shandong Province. (3) This study provides an attribution analysis of the above-mentioned land cover changes and carbon emissions and proposes corresponding solutions. This study is crucial for the development of low carbon land management policies.

## Discussion ##
Attribution analysis of land cover change and carbon emission change. The conversion of cultivated land to artificial surfaces and the conversion of forest to cultivated land and grassland in Shandong Province the main reasons for the reduction of carbon storage. This is a very common phenomenon for the current urbanisation process in China. Economic growth and population increase are the main factors leading to the change of artificial surfaces 
The conversion of water bodies and cultivated land is mainly concentrated in Jining City, which is also the region where changes in vegetation carbon storage are more pronounced. Jining City covers Weishan Lake, the largest freshwater lake in northern China, and the construction of water storage facilities such as dams and river embankments, as well as river ditches on agricultural land and aquaculture ponds, has led to large changes in the area of water bodies in Jining City 
The change in water bodies and wetland conversion is mainly distributed in Dongying City. Dongying City is located at the mouth of the Yellow River and has a low, flat topography that makes drainage difficult and is influenced by the amount of water in the Yellow River, making it easy to form wetlands 
The spatial and temporal distribution of carbon sources and sinks in Shandong province differs greatly between 2000 and 2019. According to land use intensity change and carbon emissions, it can be observed that population increase and economic development have led to a rapid rise in total energy consumption and a marked growth in land use intensity change, which in turn generates large amounts of carbon emissions, especially from industrial production land.

## Recommendations related to land planning and carbon emissions. ##
With the above analysis, it is necessary to reduce carbon emissions scientifically and effectively and to increase the carbon storage capacity of vegetation. Increasing the vegetation cover of artificial surfaces is an effective way to offset carbon losses, with forest having the highest vegetation carbon density. Planting high biomass vegetation on artificial surfaces can be a valuable method to increase carbon storage.
Furthermore, the conservation of land types such as wetland, grassland and forest is also an useful channel to increase the amount of carbon stored in vegetation. Combined with relevant conservation policies, the establishment of wetland nature conservation parks and forest conservation parks, and the improvement of relevant legal systems for environmental protection, such as the Regulations on the Return of Cultivated land to Forests 
On this basis, carbon emissions should be reduced artificially in all aspects of life, from daily life to industrial production. In industrial production, try to use clean energy and renewable energy to gradually replace fossil energy 

## Conclusions ##
This paper analysed the land cover changes in Shandong Province from 2000 to 2020 using the GlobeLand30 land cover maps. The spatial and temporal distribution of carbon stocks influenced by land cover changes was obtained according to the changes in land cover types. Carbon sources and sinks were studied in conjunction with annual average NDVI data and annual average NEP data. Land use intensity changes and anthropogenic carbon emissions were assessed based on statistical yearbook data. The specific conclusions are as follows.
(1) The main change in land cover in Shandong province during the period 2000-2020 was the conversion from cultivated land to artificial surfaces. From 2000 to 2010, a total of 7748.14 km 2 of cultivated land was transferred, with 4930.62 km 2 being converted to artificial surfaces. Between 2010 and 2020, the proportion of cultivated land converted to artificial surfaces was as high as 78.35%. energy consumption in industry was the largest in terms of total energy production, closely followed by total energy consumption in transportation, storage and postal services. Most other sectors showed a more pronounced upward trend in energy consumption. (5) The conversion of cultivated to artificial surfaces and forest to cultivated and grassland in Shandong Province, influenced by population growth and the expansion of construction land, are the main reasons for the decrease in vegetation carbon storage. Jining City is an area where the conversion of water bodies and cultivated land is more apparent, related to the construction of water storage facilities, river ditches and aquaculture ponds, and also linked to the results of remote sensing image interpretation. The conversion of water bodies and wetland in Dongying City is related to policy factors.
This study provides theoretical support and basic data for various land management policies of local governments from a more holistic perspective. In order to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality, we should slow down the expansion of artificial surfaces and increase land with higher biomass (e.g., forest), which in turn improves the vegetation carbon storage capacity of the land. Relevant government departments should promulgate and implement relevant policies on energy conservation and emission reduction, optimise the land use structure and consider reducing carbon emissions while ensuring economic development.
