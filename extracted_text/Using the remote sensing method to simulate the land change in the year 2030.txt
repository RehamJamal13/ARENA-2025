## Introduction ##
Land Use and Cover (LULC) change of the detection and forecast is an important factor for guiding planning, land resource, sustainable development management. Considering the phenological effect and seasonal adaptation, the estimation and detection of the same seasons for different years from LULC maps will greatly benefit 
An urban area is a mosaic of different landscape features or land use (e.g., impermeable surfaces, green areas, residential areas, planting areas, etc.) and has different thermal properties 
Since the 21st century, many studies show that land use change causes natural disasters, energy shortages, food shortages, economic crisis and other social and ecological problems 
The aim of this research is to (i) understand the growth of urban model and its direction, (ii) identify the land usecover changes by determining the possible future growth scenario through simulations in Samsun, one of the most vulnerable and rapidly growing cities of Turkey. The findings obtained from this study are intended to be useful to regional planners by predicting land use in advance in planning the resident and abundant resources of nature in the region by the enhancing demands in the future.
There are studies on land classification using the Remote Sensing method for Samsun. 
When we look at international indexes 
Looking at the literature review, many UA researchers have applied data mining models and different machine learning to predict future the independent UA data and LULC change using dependent. GIS commonly used the models of forecasting are as follows: SLEUTH (slope, land use, exclusion, urban extent, transportation, and hill shade), state and transition simulation model (STSM); land transformation model (LTM); ), CLUE (conversion of land use and its effects), ANN (artificial neural networkcellular automata (CA), Markov chain (MC), land change models (LCM), logistic regression (LR), spatially explicit landscape event simulation ( SELES), and GIS-based weights of evidence (WoE) approach. LU/ LC change for especially aim of predicting for the future was to provide to get useful information to the decision-makers, planning amanagemnet, government officials, and land resource planners, and for taking an effective plan for planning and management in protecting the environment of LU/LC 
This study was evaluated in terms of (i) site selection being on both urban and rural scales in the direction of increasing urbanization, (ii) being based on current data sets (iii) including simulation as well as change analysis (iii) the program used (QGis) and the algorithm used (MLP-ANN) differs from other studies.

## Material and Method ##
Samsun province is coordinate of the 40° 50'-41° 51' N, 34° 25' and 37° 08' E. It has an area of approximately 9.725 km² and consists of 17 districts (Anonymous, Accessed on 05.06.2021). According to TUIK 2020 data, the population of Samsun is 1,356,079. Samsun is the 16th largest province of Turkey in terms of population, and it constitutes 17% of the population of the Black Sea Region and 1.6% of the population of Turkey (Anonymous, Retrieved 02.05.2021). It is located in the coastline of middle part of the Black Sea, between the deltas where the rivers of Kızılırmak and Yeşilırmak flow into the Black Sea. Neighbors of the province, in the north of which the Black Sea is located; Sinop in the west, Tokat and Amasya in the south, Ordu in the east, and Çorum in the southwest. Samsun shows three different features in terms of landforms. The first part is the mountainous part in the south; the part of second region is the plateaus between the mountainous part and the coastline, the third; coastal plains between the highlands and the Black Sea 
Samsun has undergone radical changes in the last 50 years as a result of the settlement pressure concentrated on the coastal areas due to urbanization, population growth and socio-economic developments (Anonymous, Accessed: 06.06.2021). After 1998, the urban settlement area in Samsun increased by 96.32% and grew to approximately 32 km², and this growth generally developed towards agricultural areas. Since 1998, Atakum district has become a second city center 
As the study area selection criteria, the population of Atakum district is 202,618 according to 2018 data; the population of the region of Ilkadim is 332,230, the population of the region of Canik is 97,564. It is seen that the population in the research area increased in the 28-year period between 1990 and 2018, but the increase occurred more in the western direction, which is called Atakum, unlike the 30-year period between 1960 and 1990. When we look at the 2020 TUIK data, the 3rd crowded district of Samsun has been Bafra District, which is located in the western countryside (Figure 
The satellite used in the research are Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS (Collection 2, Level 2), Landsat 7 ETM+ (Collection 1, level 1), satellite data belonging to the summer months of 
The detailed process of LULC modeling covers different stages such as data collection, preprocessing, LULC post-classification analysis, validation, classification, LULC change prediction, spatial variables modeling 
In our study, algorithm of MLC was used to classify for images of satellite. The MLC technique was preferred so that it is the efficient and common classification matrils metha in the literature when the data/locations of correct training are created 
Descriptive statistics properties (mean values for each spectral band and DN (digital number) variances) are determined with the help of spectral signatures. As described in 
Controlled classification typically involves a series of steps (i) identification of training fields, (ii) spectral signature collection, and (iii) image classification 
In this study, MLC-controlled classification was performed with the original satellite data bands (LANDSAT) that produced LU/LC maps for 2000, 2010 and 2020. Then, the LU/LC maps were evaluated using the cross-classification method. The LU/LC 2000-2020 variation was observed using classified map features. A table showing the area in square kilometers was created and the area (km²) for each LU/LC class and the percentage change in the data set were calculated. accuracy assessment is that the confusion matrix statistically obtained from field data (signature file) and the maps of LU/LC was used for 
The classes within the study area were determined as (i) Water (River, Lake, Sea), (ii) Built up (Urban, Roads), (iii) Vegetation (Forest, Cropland, Delta, (iv) Open Land (Bare Soil) 
the future urban LUC of prediction in the determined research area in Samsun, the study includes three main steps: (i) preparation of LULC from satellite images, (ii) preparation of data input for terrain change modeling (iii) modeling of present LULC forecast to calculate future LULC forecast accuracy. Land use and classified images from the years 2000 and 2010 were used to generate a transition potential matrix using the QGIS MOLUSCE tool. NDVI, Distance from river, Dem, Slope were used as additional data for the model. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) which is the map of Elevation made using obtained from the of ALOS PALSAR RTC. The DEM data are extracted for the map of Slope. River networks from DEM data SHP. It was mapped by calculating the Euclidean distance from the rivers using the file. After the transition potential matrix was created, the LULC forecast for the year 2020 was modeled. Finally, the LULC simulation of the year 2030 was obtained with the MLP-ANN model. Validation of the modle of MLP-ANN is important; therefore, validation between the Q GIS Molusce extension and the MLP-ANN model, the simulated LULC for 2020 and the 2020 LULC, was obtained and the kappa coefficient was obtained.
For the prediction model of 2030, machine learning MLP-ANN algorithm was used in the field of UA and GIS. This model works such as the brain of human, where each neuron node carries information processing between them. nodes which are processing units are interconnected by or ANN with artificial neurons. output a d Input units make up the units processing of the ANN. ANN has a set of learning rules and a result follows. In the training phase of ANN, supervised and unsupervised the methods of learning are performed. In the first phase of ANN, data models will be recognized textually and visually. The wroks of ANN backwards and adjusts the connections network of weight until it produces a minimum of erroneous output 
the model of structure of ANN defined three layers, these layers are the output, hidden and input layers. The ANN of flow working of for datasets of raster is shown in Figure 
In the prediction model of 2030, LU/LC maps (raster) were used as the basic input data of 2000, 2010 and 2020 (for verification) of the present data. The supplement (auxiliary data) used in the 2030 forecast is shown in the Table 
Dem is important for geoscientists as it gives quantitative information about the structure of the land 
Calculated based on DEM, this factor shows the slope according to the Literature. It is accepted as one of the factors that have the greatest impact on urbanization 
NDVI Index: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (Formula 1).
The NDVI index is the mot important data revealing the pressure of urbanization on green areas 
In order to better demonstrate the transformation from green areas in the land cover to built-up areas, the NDVI index was used as the predictive model auxiliary data.

Water has been a very important natural resource in the establishment and spread of settlements throughout history. Cities have been established and developed depending on the availability of suitable natural conditions and water resources. In this respect, there is a close relationship between the water resources on earth and the distribution of urban centers. It has been seen that urban areas have been established near fresh water sources such as rivers, lakes and underground waters and on the sea coast for a long time. The horizontal development of cities established near water resources varies depending on the geomorphology and characteristics of the coast and the area behind it 
By selecting the first and second raster Dem data, a two-way raster comparison was made and all raster data loaded into MOLUSCE was checked. Pearson's correlation was used to compare the data in this study. The correlation coefficient between the data is given in Table 
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) machine learning algorithm (Figure 
The procedure c of validation compares the accuracy of the estimated LULC with the map of LULC obtained by processing Landsat raw data as a reference. The Kappa coefficient was used for validation purposes. It is calculated using the Kappa coefficient, see. Equation 2 

## Results ##
The changes of LU/LC to better understand, the results are divided into 4 parts: (i.) an accuracy assessment and composition of the LU/LC layers for the years 2000, 2010 2020; (ii.) change the periods of 2000-2010 analysis; (iii.) 2020 simulation with MLP-ANN method, results of comparison of simulation with 2020 data of LU/LC, determination of the method that provides the accuracy highest in the research (iv.) land cover forecast for 2030 using the method that gave the best results in the 2020 simulation. The terrain classes maps made using the maximum likelihood algorithm are given in Figure 
Parameters of ccuracy such as manufacturer and accuracy user, overall accuracy classification and coefficient of kappa of classified the maps of LULC are given in Table 
The forecast model of the accuracy of was examined by comparing the 2020 LULC forecast map with the 2020 LULC map classified. The 2020 LULC map was estimated using the 2000 and 2010 LULC maps. The overall accuracy obtained was 72% and the kappa coefficient was 0.65. This shows that the classified and predicted LULC maps of 2020 are in valid agreement with each other. Figure 
After analyzing LU changes between the two periods, relevant co-factors were determined. The co-factors Slope and Distance from River maps obtained from the Dem data are shown in Figure 
Each LU/LC category; the first step of the LCM includes rates of change, where land use change trends are evaluated in terms of losses and gains incurred. LULC losses and gains are analyzed for the period 2000-2010, 2010-2020. Tables 
Between the years 2000-2010 in Samsun, coastal filling areas were realized especially in Ilkadım district and thus an urban growth was experienced in the northern direction. Batıpark, Doğupark city parks, etc., which were built in the filling area. coastal arrangements, parks and sports fields have been effective in bringing the district to the fore. Filling areas obtained by filling the shores are used as ports, piers, fishermen's shelters, marinas, parks, public institutions and organizations.
The need for housing and social reinforcement areas, which emerged in parallel with the rapid population growth (annual increase rate of 64.5%) in the 2000-2010 period in Atakum district, caused the areal increases in the urban texture to create a more heterogeneous city pattern 
Among the parks on both sides of Samsun, Batıpark is 1.000.000 m² and Doğupark is 250.000 m². With the completion of these projects, the green area per capita has reached 9.02 square meters.
Transition Probabilities and Future Projection is an image layer of transition potential represents the probability of transition from one LU/LC class to each another for pixel 
The variation of LULC classes between land classes over the 2000-2020 time periods is shown in Figure 
According to the results obtained, the decrease in the water mass in the study area, which includes Samsun Ilkadım -Atakum -Bafra city centers and the coastline in the 20-year period between 2000 and 2020, shows the transformation into built-up areas by making the shoreline filling area. The decrease in green areas shows the transformation into bare soil areas. With the transformation into bare areas, construction begins. The filling of Samsun coastal areas dates back to the 1960s and accelerates after the 2000s 
The north-eastern part of the region includes the city center. But over the years, it is seen that the settlement has spread in the direction the topography allows. It is seen that the settlement increases in the south-west direction along the coastline. This spread towards rural areas first became a bare area and then transformed into a residential area. The matrix represents that the need for accelerated construction was came primarily by the decline in scrub and soil bare, followed by farmland and sparse vegetation.
According to the results of the algorithm, the ongoing change direction between 2000-2020 is also expected for 2030. The variation of LULC classes between land classes over the time periods 2020-2030 (10 years) is shown in Figure 

## Discussions ##
Due to the environmental problems caused by rapid and uncontrolled urbanization, studies to understand the land change and to predict possible changes in the future are increasing rapidly. datasets of remote sensing, available as open access, economical, up-to-date, and archival, are the most common systems used for spatial/temporal modeling and to determine LU/LC changes and urban growth. In this study, the LULC change between 2000, 2010, 2020 for the study area including Ilkadım, the central district where the development is most intense in Samsun, the largest port city of the Black Sea, Atakum along the coastline, and Bafra, the rural district with the most agricultural lands. were analyzed and a land change forecast for 2030 was made using the MLP-ANN (multi-layer perception artificial neural network) algorithm. The rate of land change for the years 2000, 2010, 2020, 2030 is shown in Table 
For the accuracy of the study, precautions were taken during the data download and processing stages. For example, we preferred satellite images of the summer months and recent dates so that the land cover can be seen more clearly due to seasonal factors. During the download phase of the satellite images, we determined the cloud-free rate, and at the same time, we separated the cloud-free images during the preview phase of the images. In the land classification stage, since the spectral signatures of bare soil and built areas are similar to each other, the two classes are mixed. We re-checked this separation with the Jeffries-Matusita distance meter and repeated the samples with close values. However, there are many different factors that will affect the accuracy in estimation studies. For example, heterogeneity of land in urban areas affects the results. Due to technical errors, situations that may affect the accuracy of the model may occur at the classification stage. In addition, factors of human activities are not taken into account in the estimation of LULC data 
Ozturk, (2015) chose Samsun Atakum district as the study area and compared the kappa accuracy coefficients of the results of the two estimation algorithms (CA-MC and MLP-MC) and stated that the most accurate method was MLP-MC Multi-Layer Perceptron-Markov Chain. can reach figures that will be considered valid and useful for all algorithms, but the preference of machine learning (ANN) in this study has added up-to-dateness to the study. As a result of the study and in the literature review, it is seen that the auxiliary data added to the estimation algorithm are important data that affect the land change, their numbers and accuracy affect the accuracy coefficient of the algorithm. For example, 

## Conclusions ##
Remote sensing methods are one of the most efficient methods used to analyze spatial and temporal terrain change. Machine learning for prediction is one of the methods that has emerged in recent years. In the current study, it was deemed appropriate to use the artificial neural network (MLP-ANN) algorithm. Considering the results, the conversion of fertile lands to bare land and built lands will create future ecological problems and unproductive areas that cannot meet the natural food requirement.
Our study does not currently include estimates of the impact of land change on climate change, but as 

## Suggestions ##
Based on the results, ongoing planning criteria need to be reconsidered to prevent loss of farmland and other vegetation. It is strongly recommended that the population spread should be shaped according to the new plans. In the planning phase, multidisciplinary teams consisting of city planners, landscape architects, surveyors and architects should be formed and joint work should be done. Urbanization plans cannot be considered by ignoring the ecological characteristics and habitat of the area.
