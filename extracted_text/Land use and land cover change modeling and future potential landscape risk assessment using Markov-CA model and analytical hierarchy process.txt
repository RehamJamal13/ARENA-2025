ABSTRACT:
Land use and land cover change (LULCC) has directly played an important role in the observed climate change. In this paper, we considered Dujiangyan City and its environs (DCEN) to study the future scenario in the years 2025, 2030, and 2040 based on the 2018 simulation results from 2007 and 2018 LULC maps. This study evaluates the spatial and temporal variations of future LULCC, including the future potential landscape risk (FPLR) area of the 2008 great (8.0 M w ) earthquake of south-west China. The Cellular automata-Markov chain (CA-Markov) model and multicriteria based analytical hierarchy process (MC-AHP) approach have been considered using the integration of remote sensing and GIS techniques. The analysis shows future LULC scenario in the years 2025, 2030, and 2040 along with the FPLR pattern. Based on the results of the future LULCC and FPLR scenarios, we have provided suggestions for the development in the close proximity of the fault lines for the future strong magnitude earthquakes. Our results suggest a better and safe planning approach in the Belt and Road Corridor (BRC) of China to control future Silk-Road Disaster, which will also be useful to urban planners for urban development in a safe and sustainable manner.

## Introduction ##
The land use land cover change and its modeling (LULCC-M) approach has recently been considered by the scientific community to observe environmental changes at level 4, such as local, regional, national, and global. To achieve the Sustainable Development Goals framework designed by the United Nations (UN) 2030, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been considered worldwide. Changes above level 4 are heavily impacted by natural hazards, i.e., earthquakes, floods, landslides, and forest fires. The term 'land use and land cover changes' (LULCC) refers to human modifications of the terrestrial surface of the earth, as well as the study of land surface change 
To support LULCC, land-use change models (LUCM) are considered as effective tools to analyze the causes and consequences of land-use change. Moreover, the LULC model is found to be effective when predicting the future state and spatial distribution of LULC using the gained knowledge from previous years 
Numerous methods, such as mathematical-equation-based, spatiotemporal modeling 
CA-Markov initial conditions, parameterization of the model, calculations of the transition probabilities, and determination of the neighborhood rules were defined by the remote sensing and GIS datasets 
In Sichuan province, many earth observation data have been used for land management, monitoring, and degradation studies 
In connection with this, future land use and land cover change (FLULCC) and future potential landscape risk (FPLR) patterns for the years 2025, 2030, and 2040 were observed based on the cellular automata-Markov chain (CA-Markov) modeling and multicriteria-based analytical hierarchy process (MC-AHP) approach. LULCC modeling and FPLR assessment was carried out by integrating remote sensing and GIS techniques developed for the first time in the DCEN area. However, this study considers it a unique approach to model the DCEN area closely, focusing on FLULCC along with the FPLR scenarios up to 2040.
Comparison and analysis of LULC in the distant past and in recent times is important in order to understand the changes in spatiotemporal LULC 
The present study focuses on quantitative analysis of spatiotemporal changes of future LULC changes in 2025, 2030, and 2040 based on the 2018 LULC simulation and further considers recent LR 2018 data with ancillary layers to identify FPLR areas across the DCEN. In this study, examples are shared for each future LULC map preparation, referring to 2018 as the earlier example and 2025 as the recent one, and so on. However, the broad objectives of this study were to examine three issues: (1) quantitatively evaluating FLULC changes in the DCEN in considering 2018 simulation data, (2) quantitatively evaluating future LULCC in different time domain matrices' data such as comparing earlier LULC datasets with the recent one 

## Materials and Methods ##


## Study Area ##
DCEN is a county-level city located in the Sichuan province of China, which covers an area of 318.30 km 2 . The city, which suffered a deadly earthquake in 2008, is now a UNESCO world heritage site and underwent massive renovations in 2013. It shares a border with southern Nagawa Tibet in the north, due to which it receives many tourists. The geography of the study site is mountainous with many forests, rivers, bridges, and urban infrastructures 

## Data ##
The remote sensing data used in this study were based on the Landsat 5 thematic mapper (TM) and Landsat 8 operation land imager (OLI). The spectral resolution and bands of the data were used in this study (Table

In addition, a shuttle radar topographic mission (SRTM) with 30m resolution was used for the digital elevation model (DEM) (Figure 
ISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2020, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 26
The image covers less than 5% cloud in original satellite images, 2% in 2007, 4.65% and 2018 (4.65%). Due to the presence of cloud cover in the epicentral area, we only considered the area near the 2008 earthquake epicenter (8.0 Mw). The area of interest (AOI) is demarcated in the satellite images with the help of the polygon feature using the ArcGIS 10.6 software (ESRI, Redlands, USA) environment. The two Landsat images were geometrically corrected and projected to a WGS 84 (World Geodetic System 1984) into a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 48N coordinate system. Detailed preprocessing of the Landsat 5 TM and 8 OLI images was carried out by Nath et al. 
In addition, a shuttle radar topographic mission (SRTM) with 30m resolution was used for the digital elevation model (DEM) (Figure

## LULCC Modeling Using Land Change Modeler ##
In the present study, we used the Clark Lab's land change modeler (LCM) of TerrSet 18.21 version software to develop FLULC maps based on the preprocessed classified historical satellite images of 2007 and 2018 (adopted from Nath et al. 
In order to run the future predictions, the integrated CA-Markov approach 
In addition, the model further needed to be validated first before running the simulation. Since the actual LULC image of 2018 was already available, adopted from Nath et al. 2018

## FLULC Dynamic Degree Estimation and Transition Matrices Computation Method ##
To estimate the dynamic degree (DD) changes between the various types of FLULC, i.e., to know whether there has been any loss in the area or gain in certain LULC types when comparing images for different periods, for a single FLULC type, we used the DD model to represent the spatiotemporal characteristics of FLULC change. The dynamic estimation can be calculated using the approach of Liu et al. 
where D represents the DD model, which refers to rate of change; A a is the area in the initial year; A b is the area in the terminal year; and T is the temporal scale. In our case, the time comparisons are 7, 5, 10, and 22 years, respectively. The DD model finally serves to generate statistical data in a table with DD (%) and Gain and Loss (%). Furthermore, transition matrix (TM) tables of 2018-2025, 2025-2030, 2030-2040, and 2018-2040 were computed based on the simulated LULC data of 2018, which were generated from the original 2007 and 2018 image results. Therefore, based on the 2018 simulated LULC results, similar statistical results for the different time periods of 2018-2025, 2025-2030, 2030-2040, and 2018-2040 are prepared in this study. These data (vector format) were analyzed and conversion was carried out using ArcGIS 10.6 software, which allows the identification of the areas where changes will occur, and those LULC were not altered in the FLULC. Furthermore, all of the results obtained using GIS software were exported to a text file and the databases were later used for statistical analysis.

## FPLR Evaluation Method ##
In this study, the LR evaluation methodological concept adopted from Nath et al. 
Recently, the multicriteria evaluation (MCE) method has been used to assess and aggregate weighted maps (criterion) based on expert knowledge of factor influence and interactions with LULC 
Multiple parameters, such as the future LULC maps of 2025, 2030, and 2040, the 2018 lineament feature, the 2018 LD map, fault lines, and the epicenter, overlaid along with the local geology map, slope, aspect, and DEM, are used as reference datasets in integrated mapping. Moreover, the geology map was adopted from Nath et al. 
Details of the meaning and individual weighted assigned score of each layer are given in Supplementary Table 
In this stage, for better visualization purposes, a further classification procedure of the natural breaks (Jenks) method with a five-class range (graduated color ramp applied with the blue to red intensification) was implied for each FPLR map. Finally, the prepared FPLR maps of 2025, 2030, and 2040 were masked based on the study area boundary. The entire mapping phases were performed in the multiple software domain, such as Clark Lab's LCM of TerrSet 18.21, ArcGIS 10.6 including the previously adopted ENVI 5.3, PCI Geomatica 2018, and RockWorks 16 version software, considered for earlier map preparation.

However, Nath et al. 
The FLULC change will occurr in RA with a high negative DD change of -12.69% yr -1 in 2018-2025, and in the next two time periods of 2025-2030 and 2030-2040, positive changes in DD will be observed-4.78% and 0.53% yr -1 , respectively. Overall, in the 2018-2040 time period, this trend will negatively impact RA and DD, leading to a change of -3.88% yr -1 (R 2 = 0.922) in DCEN, which is clearly evident in different time intervals. From 2007 to 2018, it showed a -4.67% yr -1 decrease, whereas in the 2018-2025 and 2025-2030 periods, it decreased -12.69% yr -1 and increased 4.78% yr -1 , respectively. By contrast, BL is projected to increase 1.32% yr -1 in 2018-2025 (Table 
However, the modeling results show different scenarios with regard to projected changes in LULC in future. The projected BU result shows the coverage area will be 15.39% in 2040 and 16.04% in 2025, both of which are lower than 2018, 18.49%. Overall, the BU data suggest a decline of -3.10% in 2018-2040 (Table 
Based on the polynomial regression data fitted to a polynomial equation in three simulated time periods and the overall scenario, the regression equation and R 2 values show each trend line. During the period 2018-2025, the R 2 value is 0.234, whereas R 2 = 0.358 and R 2 = 0.298 for the periods 2025-2030, and 2030-2040, respectively. However, during the overall 2018-2040 periods, the R 2 value is 0.251. Our model-based results given in Table

This change is obvious and always has a tendency to put pressure on AG, which likely to lead to an increase in the urban and rural population in the DCEN area.

In the final level analysis, this study further utilized MC-AHP approach to evaluate the FPLR zone for the periods 2025, 2030, and 2040. In a recent study, Nath et al. 
In comparison to 2018, the FPLR areas of the very high risk category will grow approximately 2.5 times in 2025-2040. The rest of the areas will be very low to low risk categories in future (Table 9a-c) and (Figure 

## Discussion ##
In this section, we would like to address a few issues that have been observed during FLULC change model predictions in the changing landscape of the DCEN. Firstly, the predicted and observed data are not perfectly matched; therefore, a higher-level accuracy is not achieved. Generally, a higher level of accuracy is expected when the model is run through the LCM module of TerrSet 18.21 version software. We also detected FLULC scenarios, and its trends of change in the percentage and rate of change were observed per year based on different predicted time periods from 2018 to 2040. In connection with this study, the two LULC maps 
Furthermore, the FLULC images were used to generate future potential landscape matrix (FPLM) tables based on the different time periods of 2018-2025, 2025-2030, 2030-2040, and overall 2018-2040. The model and observed data provide over 70% accuracy, which represents a substantial agreement (Section 3.1) of the model validation and its utilizations. Based on the FLULC image output, we produced FLULCC matrix tables of different time periods that show the LULCC transformation from one category to another, as well as its unchanged categories.
In developing and developed countries, the LULC changes and predictive approaches using the CA-Markov model were used across the globe in recent times. However, those studies solely represented the particular LULC changes identified in the selective regions. However, those studies were not focused on the FPLR approaches which were given much less attention and documented less in the past. In recent times, the DCEN area showed changes in LULC for the first time prior to and after the earthquake of 2008 as well as its present status, including the integrated approach to assess the LR pattern 
This study first developed and analyzed FLULC mapping and identified the different FLULCC in different time periods, 2018-2025, 2025-2030, 2030-2040, and overall 2018-2040 in the DCEN area of SW China. Here, FLULC gain/loss (%) as well as rate of change per year in the corresponding time frame were computed. Our projected results showed that the BU class has a probability of 1.12% and 1.11% to change into WB and BL, respectively (see Table 
However, in 2018-2040, the BU data suggest decreasing conditions (-3.10%) of -0.14% yr -1 , which will further decerase (-0.47%) at a rate of -0.09% yr -1 during the periods 2025-2030 and -0.18% with a -0.02% yr -1 in the period 2030-2040. The results of the earlier studies 
In addition, this study finally prepared and analyzed FPLR maps for the years 2025, 2030, and 2040 (Figure 
Therefore, this study further identified the risk according to geological zones in three projected years, 2025, 2030, and 2040. The geological zones II, I, and IV were identified as in the very high risk category (Table 
In this study, the FLULCC modeling results and FPLR areas and probable priority-based risk assessment raised a question on the environmental sustainability of the DCEN area in the coming decades. Thus, a priority-based sustainable solution would be further recommended, as well as checking the unsustainable LULC movements in the study areas. Therefore, by observing the FPLR pattern, it is high time to properly inspect and discuss with the locals what to do and what their concerns are regarding the future landscape change and FPLR, which will be incorporated in the future planning of this area to make the DCEN area sustainable. Moreover, the remote sensing and GIS integrated techniques help to build a model and validate it and are found to be ideal for plausible future LULCC prediction which may further help to identify future probable risk areas at spatiotemporal scale.

## Conclusions ##
The present study utilized geospatial data of the two past LULC maps of 2007 and 2018, LR map of 2018, and other associated derived map products used in an integrated manner to develop FLULC maps, future changing trends, and generate FPLR maps of the DCEN. As the DCEN area was previously affected by a high-intensity earthquake (8.0) and its landscape was severely affected afterwards 
From CA-Markov modeling, changes in LULC will occur in the future in the DCEN area which may be very devastating if the area is affected by high-intensity earthquakes. Therefore, all developmental planning should be focused on finding a nature-based solution that ensures there is less risk and works in conjunction with sustainability goals, with a further suggestion to stop and check developmental activities in the fault and close adjoining areas, and if possible resettle urban dwellers elsewhere, far from the fault lines. The detailed analysis in the present study will be of great use for baseline information to assist city planners, local administrations, and earthquake engineers for future planning and development and technical-know-how about upcoming landscape changes and FLR of DCEN.
An earlier study 
Finally, we found that the multitemporal Landsat images of 2007 and 2018 are very useful to generate a LULC simulation image of 2018, followed by a FLULC image for the years 2025, 2030, and 2040 of DCEN using the LCM of TerrSet software. To understand the FLULC, its trends, and future gain and loss estimation of DCEN in the future, we further calculated the matrix of the FLULC in different time domains. However, based on the integrated layers, including the FLULC of 2025, 2030, and 2040, the LD of 2018 (which will change with time) and other ancillary data were recoded with risk priority with the weighted sum method, applied to prepare FPLR maps of DCEN in a consecutive manner for the years 2025, 2030, and 2040. As we observed, DCEN was identified as a risk-prone area in an earlier study 
The findings of this study might serve as an example for any earthquake-prone city around the world, including the BRC, which will help to exclusively monitor future Silk Road disaster activities. The present study provides future projections about LULC change in the DCEN area, which may be checked in advance for further landscape damage. Geospatial (such as Remote sensing and GIS) integrated software techniques were also found to be ideal, helping to know the FLULC changing status, including in the FPLR areas. Moreover, the present study proved that the integrated techniques have the ability to know FPLR areas and the probable pattern of change in the BRC. Thus, to minimize the FPLR factors of DCEN, it is high time to exchange the results of the FLULC status and its probable change direction, including the FPLR pattern with academics, city planners, national policy makers, and locals to make the DCEN area of the BRC safe, sound, and disaster-proof. Detailed analysis shows a useful future prediction of Silk-Road disaster, which may further help towards achieving the UN 2030 sustainable goals.
