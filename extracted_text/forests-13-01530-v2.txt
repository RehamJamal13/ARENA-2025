ABSTRACT:
Land Use Land Cover Change (LULCC) and urban growth prediction and analysis are two of the best methods that can help decision-makers for better sustainable management and planning of socioeconomic development in the countries. In the present paper, the growth of urban land use was analyzed and predicted in all districts of the El Baha region (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) based on high-resolution Landsat, 5, 7, and 8 satellite imagery during the period of study between 1985-2021. Using remote sensing techniques, the LULCC were obtained based on the maximum likelihood classification (MLC), where the geographic information system (GIS) had been used for mapping LULCC classes. Furthermore, Markov cellular automata (MCA) in Idrisi TerrSet was applied for assessing the future growth of urban land use between 2021-2047. The findings of the LULCC analysis based on the MLC indicate great socioeconomic development during the study period and that the urban expansion was at the expense of rangeland, forest and shrubland, and barren land and sand areas, with the contribution of each in the built-up area estimated to be around 9.1% (179.7 km 2 ), 33.4% (656.3 km 2 ) and 57.5% (1131.5 km 2 ), respectively. The simulation of the future LULCC period 2021-2047 revealed a loss in rangeland, forest and shrubland, and barren land and sand by 565, 144 and 105 km 2 , respectively, where rangeland is the most influenced, its land cover will decrease from 4002 to 3437 km 2 . From the obtained results based on MCA, urban growth is predicted to be large and it is estimated at around 2607 km 2 until the year 2047 with a net increase of 811 km 2 . The results obtained from this study may provide information to help decision-makers to implement efficient practices for future planning and management of the growth of urban land use, especially Saudi vision 2030.

## Introduction ##
Land Use Land Cover Change (LULCC) is the modification of the Earth's surface by humans. Work to find the solution to the negative effects of such changes is ongoing despite humans being the root of the problems caused. LULCC is one of the primary contributors of greenhouse gas stocks resulting from direct human use of lands for commercial uses, settlements, and forestry activities 
Saudi Vision 2030 is a development plan started by the Saudi government in 2016 which aims to bring the country out of its historical oil rent by diversifying its economy and resorting to various privatizations 

## Study Area ##
The Al-Baha region is one of the thirteen administrative regions that make up the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the most important of which are al-Mandaq, e Buljurshi, al-Qara, alAqiq, al-Makhwah, Qelwah and al-Baha City (Figure 

## Study Area ##
The Al-Baha region is one of the thirteen administrative regions that make up the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the most important of which are al-Mandaq, e Buljurshi, al-Qara, alAqiq, al-Makhwah, Qelwah and al-Baha City (Figure 
The topography of the region is mostly mountains known as the Hijaz Mountains, and the mountainous areas are covered almost entirely by local coniferous juniper trees, in addition to many types of fruit trees, bushes, small shrubs, forests and flowers such as candi, basil, jasmine, Hijazi rose (Aqsh, raspberry) and Arfaj. Spreading on its slopes are terraces and agricultural terraces in which the residents grow the plants of the region that they rely on for food, such as sorghum, barley, wheat, millet, sesame, lentils, and local vegetables such as pumpkin, potatoes, carrots, tomatoes, peppers, and others.

## Materials and Methods ##


## Remote Sensing Databases ##
In this study, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was applied to various Landsat imagery between 1985-2021 in order to assess LULCC in the framework of urban sprawl or urban growth. The different Landsat imagery: Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) used in this analysis are represented in Table 
The Landsat 8 satellite includes two types of sensors: OLI (Operational Earth Imager) and TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor). OLI includes all ETM+ domains. In order to avoid some characteristics of atmospheric absorption, OLI reset the bands, with relatively large modifications. The databases of LANSAT databases used in this analysis were obtained from 

## The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ##
The Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a standard indicator that allows for the creation of an image that displays greenness or relative biomass. This indicator benefits from the strong absorption by chlorophyll in the red band and the high reflectance from plant materials in the near-infrared (NIR) band 
This index defines values from -1.0 to 1.0, and represents mainly the vegetation, negative values are formed mainly from clouds, water and snow, and values close to zero are formed mainly by rocks and bare soil. Very small values (0.1 or less) correspond to empty areas of rock, sand, or snow. Medium values (from 0.2 to 0.3) represent shrubs and meadows. Values from 0.3 to 0.6 explain moderate vegetation, while large values (from 0.6 to 0.8) indicate temperate and tropical forests [43].

## The Maximum Likelihood Classification ##
The maximum likelihood classification (MLC) is one of the most frequently used supervised classifications, which states that every spectral class can be defined by a multivariate normal distribution and is founded on Bayes' theorem 
i: is the class x: n is the number of bands p(œâ i ): is the probability that class œâ i occurs in the image and is assumed the same for all classes
|‚àë i|: is a factor of the covariance matrix related to the data in œâ i Œ£ i -1 : is the reverse matrix m i is the mean vector Further details regarding the theoretical and mathematical implementation of MLC are provided in 

## The Cellular Automata Markov Chain Model ##
A Markov chain (MC) is a term in mathematics that took the name of its Russian innovator, Andrea Markov. It is a stochastic process with a Markovian property. In such a process, the future is predicted from the present and does not need to know the past. A Markov chain follows a conditional probability distribution called the probability transition by-step in the process. The probability of transition in two, three or more steps is obtained from the probability of transition in one step 
where, S(t) and S(t + 1) are the status of the system at the time t and t + 1, respectively and P ij is the matrix of transition probability in a state, it is given as follows 
Pij: explains the probability of changing from the present state i to the next time state j. e. The low and high transition have a probability close to '0 and 1', respectively

After atmospheric correction, the maximum likelihood classification method was applied to produce LULCC results and mapping (net change, gain, loss and, persistence). 4.
The obtained results from ENVI 5.1 of LULCC were exported to Arcgis to improve the mapping observation and to improve the results management. 5.
Produced DEM, slope, aspect, hill shades, contours, distance from the road and distance from river maps using Arcgis based on SRTM imagery and used them as input in the prediction process. 6.
Opened land change modeler of TerrSet software, imported and inserted the LULCC maps of the years 1985 and 2021 and maps that were produced from STRM imagery 7.
Finally, transition potential and change prediction tools were run for the year 2047 to obtain a future LULCC map.

## Results ##
The results of LULCC obtained from MLC of the years 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2015 and 2021 are represented in Figure 
The LULCC map analysis of the year 1985 revealed that the rangeland area was estimated to be around 5082 km 2 (47.55%). This area has increased by 689 km 2 to an area of 5772 km 2 (Figures 
The forest and shrubland area maps analysis illustrated high temporal variability in this class during the study period which had been estimated to be 5399 (48%), 4672 (42%), 5163 (45%), 5103 (46%), 4342 (39%), 4477 km 2 (40%) in the years 
One of the specific aims of the present study was to analyze and assess the built-up area or the urban area at the scale of each district of the study (Qelwah, Elmelkhwah, Elmandaq, ELBahah, Baljurish, Alatawlah and Alaqiq). Further to the results of Figures

## Discussion ##
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has divided the urban planning process into three main stages. The first stage is the policy formulation and planning stage which was determined between the years (2001-2005), most of the discussions that took place during this time period were related to the general perception of the project and its planning aspects. The second phase is the design phase where the technical aspects and design elements were to be determined in this time period 
In addition, During the period 1961-2017, global emission increases were governed by the three highest-emitting areas (sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia) resulting from land-use change and by the extensive and rapid increase in agricultural production 

## Conclusions ##
In this paper, Landsat satellite imagery of the El Baha region has been used during the periods of 1985-2021 and 2021-2047 for LULCC analysis and urban growth prediction. The obtained results have been summarized in the following points:

## ‚Ä¢ ##
The results revealed a great socioeconomic development. The urban expansion was at the expense of rangeland, forest and shrubland, and barren land and sand areas, where the contribution of each one in the built-up areas was estimated at around 9.1% (179.7 km 2 ), 33.4% (656.3 km 2 ) and 57.5% (1131.5 km 2 ), respectively.

## ‚Ä¢ ##
The simulation of the future LULCC period 2021-2047 revealed a loss in rangeland, forest and shrubland, and barren land and sand by 565, 144 and 105 km 2 , respectively.

## ‚Ä¢ ##
The rangeland cover land is the most influenced, it will decrease from 4002 to 3437 km 2 .

## ‚Ä¢ ##
Based on MCA, it seems that urban growth will be extensive, it is estimated at around 2607 km 2 until the year 2047 with a net increase of 811 km 2 .

## ‚Ä¢ ##
The urban growth has been observed in the northern parts (districts) of the study area explaining an urban growth toward the north (Alaqiq, Baljurish and Alatawlah).

## ‚Ä¢ ##
The future simulation for the year 2047 shows that the Alaqiq district will have a great increase in the built-up areas by 471 km 2 from 661 and 1132 km 2 , followed by Baljurish, Qelwah and Elmandaq with a relatively non-significant increase of 77, 24, and 14 km 2 , respectively.
The results obtained from this study may provide information to help decision-makers to make efficient practices for future planning and management of the growth of urban land use, especially in Saudi vision 2030 for the different sectors (water resources mobilization, environment, energy, construction, agriculture and other sectors). The main strength of this study is the use of a relatively long period that allowed us to make a good assessment of LULCC in the study area, especially with the insufficient reports in this framework. The aims of sustainable development goals (SDGs) at restoring, protecting, and promoting sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, combating desertification, sustainably managing forests, and halting biodiversity loss degradation. Thus, one of the limitations of this study is that it cannot contribute to resolving SDGs problems. Further to the scope of this study, an investigation of current and future urban growth will be conducted at the scale of each district of the study area, focusing on the forest and urban green spaces assessment for better sustainable urbanization planning.
