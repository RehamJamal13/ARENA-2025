Title: Comprehensive review on land use/land cover change classification in remote sensing

Abstract: Research in the field of remote sensing of the environment is valuable and informative. Hyperspectral (HSP) and multispectral (MSP) satellite images have been used for different remote sensing applications. Land Use/Land Cover (LU/LC) change classification has been considered as important research in the field of remote sensing environment. This review aims to identify the various LU/LC applications, remote sensing satellites, geospatial software, pre-processing techniques, LU/LC classification, clustering, spectral unmixing, landscape change models and evaluation metrics. The main objective of this review is to present the more frequently used techniques for analysing LU/LC change with MSP and HSP satellite images. An aim of this review is to motivate future researchers to work efficiently with MSP and HSP satellite images in the field of remote sensing.
