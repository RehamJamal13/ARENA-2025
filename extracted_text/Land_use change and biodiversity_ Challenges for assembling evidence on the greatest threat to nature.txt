ABSTRACT:
Land-use change is considered the greatest threat to nature, having caused worldwide declines in the abundance, diversity, and health of species and ecosystems. Despite increasing research on this global change driver, there are still challenges to forming an effective synthesis. The estimated impact of land-use change on biodiversity can depend on location, research methods, and taxonomic focus, with recent global metaanalyses reaching disparate conclusions. Here, we critically appraise this research body and our ability to reach a reliable consensus. We employ named entity recognition to analyze more than 4000 abstracts, alongside full reading of 100 randomly selected papers. We highlight the broad range of study designs and methodologies used; the most common being local space-for-time comparisons that classify land use in situ. Species metrics including abundance, distribution, and diversity were measured more frequently than complex responses such as demography, vital rates, and behavior. We identified taxonomic biases, with vertebrates well represented while detritivores were largely missing. Omitting this group may hinder our understanding of how land-use change affects ecosystem feedback. Research was heavily biased toward temperate forested biomes in North America and Europe, with warmer regions being acutely underrepresented despite offering potential insights into the future effects of land-use change under novel climates. Various land-use histories were covered, although more research in understudied regions including Africa and the Middle East is required to capture regional differences in the form of current and historical land-use practices. Failure to address these challenges will impede our global understanding of land-use change impacts on biodiversity, limit the reliability of future projections and have repercussions for the conservation of threatened species.
Beyond identifying literature biases, we highlight the research priorities and data gaps that need urgent attention and offer perspectives on how to move forward.

## | INTRODUC TI ON ##
The IPBES 2019 global report ranked land-use change as the greatest driver of declines in nature and biodiversity. Combined with the direct exploitation of nature through hunting, fishing, logging, and harvesting, these threats are thought to account for more than 50% of the human impacts on terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems 
It is estimated that the biodiversity of terrestrial communities has declined on average by more than one-fifth 
Land-use change can have direct impacts on species through the destruction of habitat and modification of the environment 
Land-use change also interacts with other global change drivers. For example, it is known that road building facilitates the spread of invasive species 
Several meta-analyses and syntheses have investigated the global impacts of land-use change on biodiversity. These studies generally report that land-use change substantially reduces local species richness 
Species functional groups also show diverse responses to land-use change 
A frequent observation of these syntheses is that the response of biodiversity depends on numerous factors including biome, taxonomic group, type of disturbance, and the biodiversity metric used (e.g., 
Here, we review the land-use change and biodiversity literature to describe the range of study designs, land-use measurements, and species responses that are often used. We investigate the taxonomic, geographic, climatic, and historical distribution of the research by using named entity recognition applied to a large body of papers. Our aim is to critically evaluate the evidence base that is being used to assess the global impact of land-use change on species and to suggest ways for moving this key research forward.

## | ME THODS ##
We identified relevant studies by searching Scopus for articles that investigated the impacts of land use or land cover change on any aspect of species biology. We limited our search to terrestrial studies published prior to 2020, excluding reviews, meta-analyses, and studies from the distant past (search terms in Figure 

## | Extracting taxonomic and location data ##
We applied automated text mining methods to the abstracts of all papers identified by the Scopus search to determine the taxonomic focus and geographic distribution of research investigating land-use change impacts on species. Our analysis used and built on the methods of 
Where extracted names were not directly matched with entries in the Catalogue of Life, we attempted a series of adjusted matches following 
The process of matching extracted names with Catalogue of Life entries sometimes resulted in an extracted name being resolved to several accepted species, for example when the species was an ambiguous synonym or occasionally misapplied name. In these cases (9.9%), we kept only the directly matched accepted name from the same abstract (8.5%) or all candidate names if there were no direct matches (1.5%). Furthermore, all main analyses were conducted at genus level and above. We calculated the number of papers mentioning different taxonomic groups and used genus-level mentions to assess taxonomic representation. Additionally, species counts were aggregated into taxonomic groups and compared with the number of registered species per group in the Catalogue of Life 2019 (Figure 
We extracted and geolocated all place name mentions (toponyms) from abstracts mentioning a species binomial using the Edinburgh Geoparser 

## | Deriving additional data and validating ##
Based on the geolocated mentions identified in the previous step, we derived several attributes to assess the representativeness of the literature in a global context. Firstly, using a map of global biomes 
The background rate of papers published in the subject areas "Environmental" or "Agricultural and Biological science" on Scopus searched 16/07/2020 (more than 93% of papers in our search have one of these subject areas). (b) Publications on the impact of land-use change on species are increasing faster than the background rate, that is, as a percentage of (a), and mentions of "climate" and "intensity" are slowly increasing. (c) The frequency of papers mentioning different aspects of species biology from the search criteria. (d) Full Scopus search terms human land-use model to determine the representation of historical land-use patterns 
We manually assessed our search results and accuracy of automated text methods (full information and results in the Supplementary Material). We manually identified and resolved species in a random 1% of papers, and manually geoparsed 100 random abstracts mentioning a species to assess the accuracy of the automated geoparser and the relevance of papers.

## | In-depth review of selected papers ##
To evaluate the methodological approaches used for studying landuse change impacts on species, we read and annotated a random selection of 100 papers. These were selected from papers that mention the term "land use" in their title, as these constituted a particularly relevant subset. These 100 papers were downloaded and processed using Zotero reference manager (Roy Rosenzweig Center for History & New Media, 2020). We extracted detailed information on the studies by manually adding keyword tags to each entry, 

## | Common study designs ##
A range of study designs are used in this field, with papers sometimes combining approaches; however, space-for-time substitutions (controlimpact) are by far the most common, accounting for 61 out of the 100 papers in our detailed analysis (Figure 
Detailed before-after-control-impact (BACI) assessments can capture temporal patterns and compare changes to a dynamic baseline. For example, 
All study approaches entail some trade-offs, either logistical or theoretical, and make key assumptions that can influence conclusions and impede efforts to synthesize results (reviewed in De 
The overall finding of manually read studies was for a negative impact of land-use change on species biology; however, a low sample size for all except control-impact studies precluded us from identifying differences in the distribution of findings across study designs. The impact of land-use change on species depends on context, for example, intensifying the use of an abandoned meadow leads to increased species diversity, but intensification of a heavily grazed meadow causes declines 

## | Measuring land-use change ##
Land-use change is challenging to quantify and often involves sorting complex habitats into coarse anthropocentric cover categories such as forest, agriculture, and urban-a simplification that can overlook ecologically significant within class variation. A protected, floristically diverse grassland, for example, may support more and different species than a newly created grass field used for recreation. From an organism's perspective land-use classifications may be arbitrary, as they respond to myriad changes in difficult to measure environmental conditions such as light availability, resources, microclimate, and competition 
There are many methods used to measure land-use change 
Data on land-use intensity, such as fertilizer application or livestock per hectare, attempt to reconcile observed changes in biodiversity to within land-use variation, and capture more detailed facets of land-use change 

## | Measuring biodiversity ##
The choice of species response metric also influences our interpretation of land-use change impacts, with the perceived effects completely reversing in some scenarios. To illustrate this, consider an agricultural area beside a national park, with both habitats containing equal density of a particular species. Considering occupancy or abundance, one might conclude that agriculture is suitable habitat.
However, if vital demographic rates such as births, deaths, and migration are examined, one may find that the agricultural area constitutes a sink habitat, with an elevated death rate that is concealed by immigration (e.g. 
Of the search terms used to identify the species level effects of land-use change, "diversity" was the most common, with terms related to species composition, distribution, and abundance also occurring frequently across the 12,192 papers (Figure 
Information on demographics and vital rates help explain how some species persist or thrive in disturbed environments (e.g., 
Still, investigating these detailed variables is difficult, resource demanding, and subject to unique local variation. Basic presence data is easier to collect and is available globally for many taxa (e.g., 

## | Biases in the literature ##


## | Taxonomic biases ##
For understanding the global effects of land-use change on biodiversity, it is essential to sample a diverse range of species. Broad taxonomic coverage helps us capture complex indirect impacts and trophic feedback 
were matched to an abbreviated accepted name; 7.8% were matched to a synonym, and 1.1% were matched to an abbreviated synonym.
Species mentioned belonged to 2721 different genera, with most genera (60%) being mentioned only once (mean = 2.90, SD = 6.63, Figure 
Plants were mentioned in 45% of all papers with a species in their abstract. Several genera of large trees including Pinus, Quercus, and Eucalyptus dominated (Figure 
Vertebrates were mentioned in 43% of papers, almost equaling plants, and were, therefore, overrepresented considering species richness of the group (Figure 
A few mosquito genera were the focus of many arthropod studies, likely due to their role as vectors of human disease and the relationship between land-use change and their prevalence 
Taxonomic biases are a caveat to the conclusions of many landuse change meta-analyses. Some syntheses resort to investigating a handful of well-studied groups, trading generality for data availability (e.g., 

## | Geographic biases ##
A well-distributed literature body across space helps us infer global patterns of land-use change, identify regional mechanisms, and highlight threatened areas. Of the 4108 abstracts mentioning species, 3213 also mentioned a geographic location. Of the 147 countries mentioned, the United States appeared most often, with roughly the same number of mentions (480) as the next five countries combined (Figure 
In Russia, the Middle East, and Africa we found very few studies despite some hotspots in South Africa and Tanzania. The blank spots on the map-where there are few or no identified studies-reveal gaps in our knowledge of region-specific land-use change drivers and how they may be impacting ecological communities. In the conservation literature at least, research in Africa and Southeast Asia appears to be stagnant or even decreasing over time, exacerbating their underrepresentation (Di 
The uneven geographic distribution of studies has consequences for the representation of biomes (sensu 
Based on the coordinates of subcountry locations, we detected a surplus of studies in all temperate biomes, accounting for over half of all locations. This abundance, and disparity with global area, was most apparent for temperate forest biomes. The most underrepresented biomes regarding land area are deserts and xeric shrublands, tundra, and boreal forests. Insufficient sampling of arid regions could hamper conservation efforts as 
Community responses to land-use change can vary geographically due to the specific nature of threats and differences in species sensitivity 

## | Further dimensions of land-use change ##


## | The role of climate ##
Land use and climate change interact with the implications for the distribution and persistence of species 
In our analysis, we found that the climatic distribution of landuse study locations did not match with the pattern of global terrestrial climate (Figure 
The narrow climatic range of this research body may have several consequences as the richness of taxonomic groups peak in different climate zones 

## | Land-use history ##
Extensive and persistent influences of humans date back thousands of years in some regions 
Global maps of land-use history can help us identify prime regions for investigating the role of legacy effects and recovery times (Figure 
Synthesizing land-use change research requires covering the full diversity of land-use histories and understanding time-lagged biotic responses. We found that studies in areas with sustained human use (>20% of area used) until the present all had a higher share of studies than their global coverage suggests (Figure 
The disparity in magnitude is particularly evident for areas with greater than 2000 years of sustained use, and areas with 100-250 years of sustained use. Coverage of these two extremes F I G U R E 7 Representation of land-use histories as the percent of location mentions within each category versus global cover. Land-use histories identified from 
In some regions, human impacts have declined from previous levels and what appear to be pristine ecosystems may actually be recovering. Forests regrowing after agricultural abandonment, for example, can display the legacy effects lasting millennia 
The geographic bias of studies limits the applicability of findings and the reliability of future projections. Investigating the full diversity of regional land-use mechanisms will be key to determining a global outlook. A bias toward forest ecosystems may be at the expense of other diverse habitats including tropical and subtropical savannas and grasslands. A key challenge moving forward will be ex- 

## | PER S PEC TIVE S ##
To improve our understanding of how land-use change affects biodiversity, we need to investigate both sides of the paradigm in greater detail through improvements in land use and biodiversity data as well as study designs (Figure 
Land use and biodiversity surveys across large extents (e.g., nationally) are important but need to be aligned spatially and temporally.
Moving forward, we must also put more attention on the legacies of historical human disturbance when monitoring biodiversity and pursue further research into the interaction of land-use change with other global drivers 
Geographic and taxonomic biases underpin many of the challenges facing this field. However, neither can be solved with the data that we currently have. Filling these gaps will require concerted fieldwork on neglected taxonomic groups in understudied regions, with an emphasis on collaborative research efforts. The advancement of space-borne remote sensing will also be pivotal. Global submeter resolution maps of vegetation and land use will be invaluable for tackling geographic biases when coupled with fieldwork in understudied systems. Proximal sensing methods such as camera traps, drones, sound recorders, and climate loggers will also help increase the effectiveness of data collection. We cannot make effective conservation and policy decisions on what we do not fully understand.
In this paper, we have highlighted the research priorities and data gaps that need urgent attention.
