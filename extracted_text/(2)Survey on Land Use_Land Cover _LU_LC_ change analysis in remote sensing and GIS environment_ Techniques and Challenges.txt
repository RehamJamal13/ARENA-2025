ABSTRACT:
The surface of the earth is rapidly changing every day due to certain natural reasons and other impacts by society. Over the last few decades, the hottest topics in the field of remote sensing and GIS (geographic information system) environments have evolved from observing the nature of the earth. Owing to the enlargement of several worldwide modifications related to the nature of the earth, land use/land cover (LU/LC) change is considered as the matter of utmost importance in the natural atmosphere, and it has also become an interesting area to be studied by the researchers. As there is a lack of review articles in the land use/land cover change analysis process, we presented a comprehensive review which may help the researchers to proceed further. This paper deals with the most frequent methods used by researchers on various processes like pre-processing, classification, and prediction of time series satellite images for analyzing the LU/LC changes using satellite images. The generic flow of the LU/LC change analysis process and the challenges faced during each process by the researchers are discussed. Varied resolutions of the environmental image captured by remote sensing satellites for analyzing the LU/LC changes are discussed. Various LU/LC classes depending on change in the earth's surface are also studied and the constraint used in each application is stated. The importance of this review lies in the motivation for future researchers to work on the LU/LC change analysis problem effectively.

## Introduction ##
The significance of timely and precise information relating to the nature and scope of land possessions and changes over time is increasing rapidly, particularly in metropolitan areas. Inspecting the Earth from space is crucial for understanding the influence of man's actions on natural resources over different time intervals. The information from the remote sensing satellites in mapping the earth's features and infrastructures has become dynamic. Map-to-map comparisons and imageto-image comparisons are observed in the variations caused by the factors of the LU/LC change process. Land use and land cover are the terms with different degrees of significance in the field of scientific remote sensing. Natural and biological landscapes such as forests, marshlands, grasslands, water lands, and urbanized and built areas denote the land cover area detected from the surface of the earth. The events that take place in the land represent the current use of the properties such as built-up institutions, shopping centers, parks, and reservoirs are described as land use categories 
Remote sensing is also regarded as an essential cause of thematic maps, depicting land cover as it affords a map-like representation of the specific surface of the earth that is spatially constant and extremely reliable, as well as accessible at a range of spatial and temporal measures. Thematic presentation or mapping from remotely detected or sensed images is naturally based on image classification which is attained by computer-aided or visual analysis. The main use of image classification is the labeling of the pixels in the images captured with meaningful information of the real world for enhanced and advantageous information extraction. Thematic maps holding information such as cadastral information, vegetation, and the land cover type could be obtained through the classification of satellite images 
From the broad analysis, we observed many researchers describe the problem of LU/LC change analysis for different regions across the world in the field of remote sensing. Some of the research articles are summarized and explained as follows: Zagros forest preservation plan was made for the protection of forest-covered regions in Iran against destruction. A study of the LU/LC change analysis process for a different time interval between 1992 and 2016 was made by using the Landsat images for the Zagros forest region. Atmospheric and geometric corrections were made for the removal of errors seen in the Landsat images. The supervised maximum likelihood algorithm was used for classifying the images into different classes like the forest, agriculture, rangeland, and builtup areas. Post-processing was done to enhance the image for attaining good classification accuracy. Suitability map was extracted using a Markov chain model. The LCM (Land Change Modeler) using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network helped in calibrating the dependent and the independent variables for predicting the future LU/LC changes in the year 2024 
The spatial and temporal pattern of LU/LC change was observed in the forest-covered area of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (NHAR), China, from 1991 to 2015. Cloud shadows were removed from the Landsat images and the landscape brightness effects on the DEM (digital elevation model) data were reduced using the topographic correction method. The maximum likelihood classification map was used for further post-processing and LU/LC change analysis process 
Changes in the Savannah River Basin for four-time intervals during the period 
The Random Forest, k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and support vector machine (SVM) non-parametric classifiers were in the classification of the Sentinel-2 satellite data for the region of the Red River Delta (RRD), Vietnam. The performance of machine learning methods is compared and analyzed. Google Earth images were used as the training datasets during the process of accuracy assessment. The results revealed that the high overall accuracy by support vector machine followed by Random Forest and k-nearest neighbor (Thanh Noi and Kappas 2018). Many researchers have worked on the LU/ LC change prediction problem for different regions across the world. The hybrid model of cellular automata and Markov chain has been broadly used for LU/LC prediction in the built-up area, forest-covered area, watershed area, mountainous region, and desert region 
Using the hybrid classification methods provides good accuracy during the LU/LC classification process. The unsupervised ISODATA clustering method with the pixel-based supervised maximum likelihood classification method was used for classifying the Landsat imageries for the region of Andassa watershed, Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia. The LU/LC changes were analyzed and calculated from 1985 to 2015. Cellular automata with Markov model is used to predict the LU/ LC condition for the year 2030 and 2045 

## Motivation ##

## Satellite image acquisition ##
The selection of a suitable dataset is the most significant process in the LU/LC change analysis. The image was collected through aerial photographs, satellite imageries, ancillary data, Google maps, forest department, land resource management, and urban planners. The datasets from different time intervals require careful collection for further processing in remote sensing environment. From various studies, we observed that there were many datasets used by the researchers in the analysis of the LU/LC change. Some of them are shown in Table 

## Image processing software types and its key features ##
In the precise study of remote sensing, we identified the different geospatial software tools used by the researchers for various stages such as pre-processing, classifying, analyzing, and predicting the LU/LC changes using the multispectral satellite images. Some of them are described in Table 

## Image pre-processing techniques ##
The image pre-processing techniques are used for improving the quality and visibility of the satellite images. It is considered as an initial stage where the image enhancement, geometric, radiometric, atmospheric, and topographic corrections are made to improve the quality of the satellite image. Table 

## LU/LC classification methods ##
LU/LC classification is the method of labeling the pixels in the pre-processed satellite image for obtaining the classified images. Every pixel is considered as a unique entity and assigned to a particular class through pixel-based classification. Objectbased classification is the collection of information from a group of related pixels, i.e., it grabs the pixels into graphical shapes, sizes, and other spatial properties. The normally distributed data is assumed under parametric classifiers. The nonparametric classifiers do not consider the classification of statistical parameters or normal assumptions. Fuzzy methodology and spectral mixture analysis are considered as effective methods for sub-pixel-based image classification as they help in sorting out the land cover types in the particular region 

## Post-classification and LU/LC change analysis ##
Post-classification is an improvement process, which improves the quality of the classified LU/LC map through the removal of noise and misclassification errors. This process helps in the enhancement of the overall accuracy by removing the single and scattered pixels present in the LU/LC classified image. Post-classification processing assists in solving the misclassification error that occurs due to substantial spectral confusion between the LU/LC classes, (i.e., confusion between the agricultural land and the barren land). This process holds the advantage of reclassifying the pixels that are misclassified 
The LU/LC classified image will be processed for validating the change analysis for different time intervals over a particular region. LU/LC change analysis is done for the determination of the changes that occurred in some specific areas and for helping in making useful decisions relating to the protection of an environment. The percentage and rate of change are calculated for identifying the magnitude of changes that occurred between different time intervals 

## LU/LC classes and its factors ##
The LU/LC classified classes include areas like built-up area, agricultural land, forest area, vegetation land, water bodies, wasteland, mountain area, and desert area. We collected the LU/LC information of India in the year 2015 to 2016 from Bhuvan-Thematic Services of the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), for getting a good understanding of LU/LC classes. The LU/ LC classified classes in India, for the year 2015 to 2016, are Google Earth provides the multi-temporal time series data and it helps during the process of accuracy assessment.
shown in Fig. 
Based on the development of land transformation in a specific area, the suitability map provides the information needed for the specific LU/LC classes. For instance, forest suitability maps provide information on the different species of trees grown in a specific location of the forest-covered region. The suitability of areas is mapped with the consideration of weighted factors like slope, elevation, and distance from the forest edge, road, water bodies, wasteland, grassland, agricultural land, and settlements 
Table 
Statistical tests were conducted for finding the association between the dependent variable (LU/LC change map) and the independent variables (slope, elevation, and distance from the river, forest edge, barren land, built-up area, and agriculture area). The Cramer's V coefficient test is widely used by the researchers for enabling observation of the association between the dependent and independent variables. The Cramer's V coefficient value always lies between zero (no association between the variables) and one (complete association between the variables). These independent variables are considered as the key factors in analyzing the future LU/LC changes 

## LU/LC prediction models ##
Different environmental models are used by the researchers for forecasting future LU/LC changes. It is necessary for every researcher to work on LU/LC change prediction problem considering the provision of the predicted results to the land resource management and to urban planners to help them in taking suitable actions for protecting the land cover environment. Table 
THE Markov chain (MC) model is used for analyzing the time-based changing landscapes among the LU/LC classes based on the transition probabilities 

## Commonly used metrics ##
We identified the most commonly used metrics for analyzing the satellite images and they are listed as follows: NDVI, NDWI, confusion matrix (used to equate the classified image with the reference image), the kappa coefficient, and overall accuracy. The percentage of change and rate of change is calculated for determining the number of changes experienced between a certain time interval. 

## H-p H-p H-p ##
Environ Sci Pollut Res 

## NDVI ##
The probability of having lower or higher vegetation is identified by the NDVI values 
where NIR represents the Near-Infrared Band and RED represents the Red Band.     

## NDWI ##
The probability of having lower or higher water content is identified by the NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) values 
where NIR represents the Near-Infrared Band and SWIR represents the Short Wave Infrared Band.

## Confusion matrix, accuracy assessment, and kappa coefficient ##
Accuracy assessment is an indispensable and decisive measure in the remotely sensed image classification for detecting the LU/LC change. The reference images are compared with the classified images employing the confusion matrix. Table 
The confidence of the classified images largely depends on accuracy assessment. The analysis of various studies shows the computation of the overall accuracy as the basic need and the kappa coefficient for testing the correctness of the classification process. 
where KS represents kappa statistics; N signifies the matrix r signifies number of rows in the confusion matrix; x ii denotes row i and column i observations; x i+ denotes row i observations; x +i represents column i observations.

## Rate percentage of change ##
For demonstrating the magnitude of the LU/LC change for the different time intervals in a modest way, the rate of change and the percentage of change are calculated.
where POC represents the percentage of change; ROC represents the rate of change; T 1 represents the area (ha) of LU/LC for the time interval 1; T 2 represents the area (ha) of LU/LC for the time interval 2; T i represents the time interval between the T 1 and T 2 in years (yr).

## Conceptual framework ##
The utmost purpose of this review paper is to provide a conceptual framework for the comprehensive land use/ land cover change analysis process and it is shown in Fig. 

## Discussions ##
The natural reasons and the significant changes over the earth's surface for a long time interval have led to the process of LU/LC change analysis. In a remote sensing and GIS environment, several images from different satellites have been deliberated as the important data source where numerous kinds of land cover changes like deforestation, expansion of agricultural land, increase in urban growth, and loss of wetlands over the different time interval is recognized. Steps involved in the analysis of LU/LC change are, acquisition of satellite images, image pre-processing, LU/LC classification, post-classification, accuracy assessment, change analysis, validating dependent and independent variables, and LU/LC change prediction. The different datasets and their sources have been discussed and defined in this paper. The commonly used software programs for processing the different satellite images have also been discussed in this study. Among them, ENVI, ArcGIS, ERDAS Imagine, and IDRISI are frequently used by researchers. Image pre-processing is considered the most important stage, and therefore it should be performed before the LU/LC change analysis process. A few image pre-processing techniques used by researchers help in correcting the atmospheric, radiometric, geometric, and topographic errors in the satellite image. Pre-processing of satellite images should be processed carefully since it is the initial process following data collection. The LU/ LC classification is the strongly focused part in remote sensing environment. Different classification algorithms were used by researchers for classifying the preprocessed satellite image into different classes. We observed that the hybrid classification algorithms provide good accuracy for the pre-processed satellite image. The process of post-classification should be carefully made for removing the misclassification errors in the LU/LC classification map. The Google Earth Engine is the widely used geospatial software for analyzing and obtaining the reference data during the process of accuracy assessment. The classified LU/LC map is analyzed  

## 2015) ##
by calculating the area of change that happened for different time intervals. Dependent (LU/LC map) and independent variables (slope, elevation, and distance variables) are the important factors in predicting the LU/LC change. Hence, most of the researchers tend to prefer an effective hybrid prediction method for monitoring and predicting the land cover changes for certain time series in a particular region. Among the performance metrics, the accuracy assessment and kappa statistics were considered as the efficient and required metrics for every LU/LC classification and prediction problem to validate the performance of the results.

## Challenges ##
This paper provides a few research challenges faced during every stage of the LU/LC change analysis process. The challenges are summarized as:
& Acquisition: During the image acquisition process, extracting the region of interest from the study area through datum coordinates from the suitable satellite system is a challenging task for researchers. & Pre-processing: During satellite image pre-processing, geo-referencing the unknown coordinates of   The challenges focused in this paper could be a fertile source for future researchers to do their work actively in LU/ LC remote sensing environment.

## Conclusions ##
This paper evidently presents the generic flow of the LU/LC change analysis process and also provides a detailed discussion on techniques and the challenges faced during each stage of the LU/LC process. The importance of finding the future LU/LC change today employing prediction methods is in the provision of judgments to the land resource management. Moreover, this information will help the government officials, namely, urban planners and forest department, to take necessary actions over the protection of a LU/LC environment. graphic gradients in Hugumburda national forest priority area, Fig.
