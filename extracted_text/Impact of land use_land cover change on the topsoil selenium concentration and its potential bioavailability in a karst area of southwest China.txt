Title: Impact of land use/land cover change on the topsoil selenium concentration and its potential bioavailability in a karst area of southwest China

Abstract: Land use/land cover change affects total soil Se content and its bioavailability. Soil organic carbon was the overriding edaphic factor controlling soil Se status. Climate variables strongly influenced soil Se status at the regional scale. Soil Se retention increased after cropland abandonment mainly due to SOC accumulation.
