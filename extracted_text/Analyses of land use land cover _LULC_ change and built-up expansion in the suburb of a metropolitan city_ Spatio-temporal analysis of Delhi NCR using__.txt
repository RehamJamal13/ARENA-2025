ABSTRACT:
During past four decades, in post economic reforms period, Delhi and its surrounding regions has attracted a large number of populations which led to the rapid transformation of its LULC pattern. Therefore, this study is aimed to analyze the LULC changes during 1990-2018 as well as the growth and pattern of built-up surfaces in relation to the population growth and migration in the suburbs of Delhi metropolitan city which is also known as the National Capital Region (NCR). The Landsat 5 (TM) and Landsat 8 (OLI/TIRS) data has been used for the LU/LC classification of Delhi NCR. The K means clustering technique was applied on the Landsat data for the LULC classification and then the change detection technique was used to quantify the LULC change.
The result shows that the considerable changes in LULC have occurred with continuous increase in built-up area and open/fallow land and decrease in agriculture land and vegetation over the study time period. Built-up area increased by about 326 percent and open/fallow land by 44 percent while the agricultural land and vegetation cover have decreased by 12 percent and 34 percent of the total area of study respectively during the study period. Built-up area has mostly increased at the expense of agricultural land and vegetation cover while vegetation cover has been transformed into Built-up area, Ridge and Agriculture. The statistical analysis shows that the association between built-up expansion and the population and migrants varies from weak to high but the coefficient of determination was always positive.

## Introduction ##
Though the environmental transformation of earth by human activities began in late-Pleistocene, it increased with the emergence of agriculture and urbanized societies 
The global changes are brought about as a consequence of the LULC changes which are being driven by the human to fulfil their need for food, water, fibre and shelter 
The LULC changes have shown to have both direct and indirect impacts on the various aspects of environment 
Numerous studies have analyzed the quantitative and qualitative changes in the LULC pattern and its drivers using different approaches and techniques. 
Population density of Delhi has increased from 6352 persons per sq. Km in 1991-11,297 per sq. Km in 2011 (Census of India, 2011). It had resulted not only in the formation of separate and extended regional planning Unit which is called National Capital Region or Delhi NCR 

## Study area ##
Delhi NCR is the Indian central planning region comprising of National Capital Territory Delhi in its core with 18 adjacent districts from the states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan surrounding it (Fig. 
In NCR, Delhi has the dominances of impermeable concrete surfaces comprising of residential, industrial and commercial areas in its land use 

## Materials and methods ##


## Materials ##
For 1990 and 2003 the Landsat 5 (TM) data while for 2018, the Landsat 8 (OLI/TIRS) data downloaded from United States Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Explorer has been used in this study for LULC mapping and change analysis. The spatial resolution of Landsat TM data was 30 m and OLI/TIRS data was 15 m (after incorporating the panchromatic band). The data were downloaded for same season of the each study year, i.e. March or April months. The details of the satellite data used in this study are given in Table 

## Methods ##


## Method for land use land cover (LULC) classification ##
LULC classification is one of the methods for obtaining the information from satellite imageries 

## Accuracy assessment ##
The post classification accuracy assessment is an important part of the LULC classification and mapping which is used to analyze the precision of the classified maps 
In this study, Kappa coefficient technique is used to evaluate the accuracy of LULC maps of Delhi-NCR using 400 randomly selected points. The points were selected in a way that covers each LULC classes in almost equal proportion and from all parts of the study area. The ground observation for 1990 and 2003 were taken from Google Earth Pro domain as the field data was not available for these years. Further, for 2018, the ground observations were taken partially both from field visit as well as using Google Earth pro domain for the areas having either no or difficult access. The results of accuracy assessment show an overall accuracy level of 87.79 percent, 90.41 percent and 89.57 percent for 1990, 2003 and 2018, respectively and the corresponding Kappa statistics was 0.8763, 0.8909 and 0.8872, respectively.

## Statistical analysis ##
To analyze the relationships between the LULC demographic changes, the linear regression technique has been performed using scatter plot technique on the Microsoft Excel (MS Excel) software 2010 version. In this study, the district-wise built-up area and population and migration data has been used for the year-wise regression analysis. For this the built-up area was extracted from the LULC maps prepared using Landsat (TM and OLI) data while the data of population and total migrants were taken from Census of India. The scatter plots are used to show the trend of linear relationship. The uphill trend line shows the positive linear relationship between the variables while the downhill trend line shows the opposite. The magnitude of the relationship is calculated by the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) which can be high, medium or low.   

## Dynamics of land use land cover (LULC) change ##
In general NCR has witnessed changes in all the LULC categories but maximum changes have been witnessed in Built-up. Built-up area has witnessed a gigantic growth of 114 percent from 1990 to 2003 and 99.02 percent from 2003 to 2018, making an overall growth of 326 percent during the study period (Table 
Fallow land is next to Built-up that has witnessed massive increase of 44 percent during the study period, however rate of increase    was 29.19 from 1990 to 2003 and 9.90 percent from 2003 to 2018. This growth is mostly at the expanse of agriculture which contributes to about 57.6 percent to the total increase of fallow land during the study period. While fallow land has witnessed an increase on western side it has undergone decrease on south-western side of the study area. The Vegetation cover has witnessed the maximum decrease of 34 percent among all the LULC classes during the study period however it decreased by 23 percent from 1990 to 2003 and 15.13 percent from 2003 to 2018 (Fig. 

## Analysis association of built-up expansion with population and migration ##
For the analysis of association of built-up expansion with population growth and migration, the district-wise data of population, migration and built-up areas has been used. The Delhi NCR covers 34 districts; 11 districts of Delhi, 2 districts of Rajasthan, 13 districts of Haryana and 8 districts of Uttar Pradesh state. The result shows that the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) varies from very low to high. The association between total migrants and built-up area was positive but very weak (0.03) in 1990 while it was moderate and positive (0.44) in 2003 and high positive (0.56) in 2018 (Fig. 

## Discussion ##
In India, the urbanization has taken place at an unprecedented rate during past few decades, especially after the economic reforms of 1991 
The maximum expansion of built-up area has been noticed from the Gautam Buddha Nagar district in which the fast growing Noida city is located and the NCT of Delhi, located in the centre of NCR. Both these cities (Noida and Delhi) have experienced rapid urbanization during the past few decades due to population growth and economic development 
Land is the main and primary natural resource available for human and is utilized in various ways for various purposes. Thus any change in human population directly affects the land and land use pattern of an area 

## Conclusion ##
This comprehensive study is done to examine the Spatio-temporal pattern of LULC changes in Delhi NCR, which is an inter-state planning region and has experienced rapid population growth and economic development during past decades. The land use land cover (LULC) maps were prepared using Landsat 5 (TM) and Landsat 8 (OLI/TIRS) satellite data and then the change matrix was calculated. The result shows that LULC pattern of the Delhi NCR has been altered significantly during the study period. The maximum change is noticed from the built-up area which has increased to about 326.65 percent, followed by open/fallow land which is increased by about 41.98 percent during 1990-2018. At the same time the vegetation cover, water bodies and agricultural land are declined by -34.84, -22.51 and -12.44 percent, respectively, while the ridge part has noticed a negligible decline in its area. The result also shows that the agricultural land and fallow land are the major contributors in the growth of built-up area, as the built-up area has expanded mostly over these land use classes, while the vegetation cover also has significant contribution in built-up expansion. Further, the analysis of relationship between built-up and population distribution shows that in 1990 and 2003, the association was positive but weak but in 2018, relationship significant and positive. On the other hand, the relationship between total migrants and built-up distribution was weak in 1990, but is moderate and positive in 2003 and high-positive in 2018. This implies that the increasing migration is the major determinant of built-up expansion; however, it does not completely determine the built-up expansion and land use change. Thus the authors suggests for the future research to incorporate the data of economic growth and industrial development (like number of industries) in the study of LULC change of such region with high economic and administrative importance.
