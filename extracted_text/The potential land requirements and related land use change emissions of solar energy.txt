ABSTRACT:
Although the transition to renewable energies will intensify the global competition for land, the potential impacts driven by solar energy remain unexplored. In this work, the potential solar land requirements and related land use change emissions are computed for the EU, India, Japan and South Korea. A novel method is developed within an integrated assessment model which links socioeconomic, energy, land and climate systems. At 25-80% penetration in the electricity mix of those regions by 2050, we find that solar energy may occupy 0.5-5% of total land. The resulting land cover changes, including indirect effects, will likely cause a net release of carbon ranging from 0 to 50 gCO 2 /kWh, depending on the region, scale of expansion, solar technology efficiency and land management practices in solar parks. Hence, a coordinated planning and regulation of new solar energy infrastructures should be enforced to avoid a significant increase in their life cycle emissions through terrestrial carbon losses.
The technologies harnessing renewable energy sources are characterized by a power density several orders of magnitude lower than fossil fuels 1 . As a consequence, the transition to these sources of energy is expected to intensify the global competition for land 
For sources of renewable energy other than bioenergy, land requirements and the associated environmental impacts remain understudied in the literature from a quantitative point of view 1,10 . In the case of solar energy, the land competition element is usually expected to be negligible due to its higher relative energy density compared to bioenergy and the possibility to integrate it in urban areas or non-productive land 7,14-16 , and as such is currently excluded from official statistical reporting and integrated assessment models (IAMs). However, recent studies based on satellite views of utility-scale solar energy (USSE) under operation, either in the form of photovoltaics (PV) or concentrated solar power (CSP), show that their land use efficiency (LUE) is up to six times lower than initial estimates 
The installation of USSE on land is subject to a diversity of constraints: solar resource constraints, which are related to the solar irradiance in a certain area; geographical constraints such as the slope and the existing use of the land; and regulatory constraints, e.g. the protected status of the land, often related to ecosystem and wildlife preservation

## Solar land occupation. ##
Table 
The future land requirements of solar energy obtained for each scenario and region can be put in perspective compared, for example, to the current level of built-up area and agricultural cropland. In the three regions, a large part of the total built-up area (urban and solar land) will consist of solar PV panels or CSP heliostats by 2050 if at least half of the produced electricity comes from solar power. Land for solar would amount to over 50% of the current EU urban land, over 85% for India, and over 75% in Japan and South-Korea. From a different perspective, a significant part of the sunlight captured for commercial use would be used for electricity generation instead of growing crops, especially in Japan and South-Korea (29-39%) and the EU (8-10%). The relative projected land area dedicated to either crops or solar energy strongly differs within each region, with potential local ecosystem and landscape implications (see Figure 
Land cover changes. Solar energy infrastructure currently occupies a negligible amount of land globally.
Our results show that this changes in scenarios with a high share of solar energy in the future electricity mix. Figure

Results for bioenergy scenarios included for comparison. a These are realized penetration levels. See Section 1b in the SM for more information. b Land suitable for commercial purposes does not include the use of rooftop space, deserts or dry scrublands that are not suitable for crop, pasture or forest cultivation. Deserts and dry scrublands in India host about 11.5-12% of solar energy throughout all penetration scenarios of solar energy in India (see Figure 

## Solar energy versus bioenergy. ##
IAMs which link energy, economy, land and climate modules tend to rely strongly on the cultivation of dedicated bioenergy crops (such as switchgrass and miscanthus) in global climate change mitigation scenarios 
Table 
deserts and dry scrublands, as well as bioenergy from waste or agricultural and forestry residue, are assumed not to contribute to LUC emissions nor carbon sequestration.

## Discussion ##
By representing the land requirements of solar energy within an IAM that integrates energy, land, socioeconomic and climate systems, we were able to, for the first time in the literature to our knowledge, estimate the land cover impacts and related LUC emissions of solar energy within climate change mitigation scenarios up to 2050. The obtained results represent a contribution to the novel field of research which analyses the environmental impacts of significantly up scaling renewables other than biomass 
A combination of technical and geopolitical reasons complicates the installation of solar energy far from consumption points. Therefore, a high share of solar generation in the energy mix in relatively densely populated regions with high per capita energy demands can require a significant share of domestic land, comparable to the current built-up area in these regions. The most relevant factors influencing the land use per unit of solar energy are solar irradiation, latitude, and future solar module efficiencies. At the domestic level, solar energy is found to predominantly compete for land with cropland and managed forests, while on a global scale, 27 to 54% of the land required for solar energy is found to indirectly displace unmanaged forests, predominantly outside the Table 

## Solar penetration level ##
Using an existing IAM to study the potential land impacts of solar energy expansion, we were bound to the limitations of this model. One of these was the division of land zones in the model (corresponding to Agro-Ecological zones, see "Methods" section), which determine the boundaries of the geographical competition to host solar energy within each region. This pre-defined distribution was originally designed to capture variations in crop yields, and is not ideal for defining the geographical diversity of solar energy "yields" within a region. Although a general good correspondence is found, there are also exceptions (see Figure 
To date, land use for solar energy is negligible compared to other human land uses. However, the obtained results show that in future scenarios, with a largely decarbonized electricity system, high penetration rates of solar energy will require significant amounts of land to be occupied by solar power plants. Further work applying ecological tools should be focused towards investigating the implications of these additional land occupation levels -including the additional transmission power lines-in terms of habitat fragmentation and ecosystem disturbance. Siting policies for USSE should avoid adverse land impacts and limit land competition, for example by excluding high yield cropland as already performed in some countries 

## Methods ##
The Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), version 4.3, has been used as a base for this study 
In order to identify the effects that solar energy and bioenergy pathways have on land use and land use change emissions, three pathways have been modelled achieving a defined penetration level in the electricity mix from The land occupation of solar and bioenergy (Figs. 
Land competition in GCAM. Land use and agricultural output in GCAM version 4.3 are calibrated for pre-defined Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZs), which sub-divide geo-political regions in 18 different types of land regions, based on differences in climate zones (tropical, temperate, boreal) and the length of growing periods for crops 
Land use in GCAM has been divided in different nodes that affect the level of competition between different uses (see Figure 

## Solar land-use module. ##
An additional module has been developed for the GCAM model to link the consumption of solar energy with land use, competing with other commercial (crops, timber and intensive pastures) and non-commercial (natural forest, grassland, scrubland) land uses. Specifically, the solarland category is included in the "Crops" land node (Figure 
To define the value of land for hosting solar energy, a yield in terms of energy output per unit of land has been defined for every AEZ. Equation (4) defines this yield for each AEZ, which depends on average solar irradiation (I) per AEZ, average efficiency of solar power plants (f 1 ) at the year of installation (t), the averaged performance ratio over the life cycle of the solar power plant (f 2 ) and the land occupation ratio (f 3 ) 1,17 . To estimate I per AEZ, (1) Land occupation i,p,r = land for i i,p,r -land for i NL,p,r 
we overlapped the solar irradiance annual average data

## Impact of solar energy infrastructure on local carbon cycle. The impact of USSE infrastructures ##
on local microclimates is a field in early research stages, although some case studies have been performed. In the case of solar energy on pastures in wet climates, a significant loss of carbon in vegetation and soils can be expected in the land below the infrastructure that is permanently blocked from sunlight, but the year-round carbon cycle in gap areas between rows of solar panels will be hardly affected 
• Land clearing: Clearing and grubbing of soil and roots, topsoil stripping and stockpiling, land grading and levelling, and soil compaction. Existing vegetation that supports habitat is removed and any other vegetation is often discouraged; weeds and other unwanted vegetation are generally managed with herbicides and by covering the ground with gravel; this is a common practice in various countries 
; β and ∅ in radians is based on a rationale of balancing cost minimisation (i.e. no seeding, no herbicides) with land conservation (i.e. minimising ecosystem disturbance). • Pasture conversion: Irrespective of the previous land use, all land below and around the infrastructure is (re)seeded with grass before or right after the construction phase, and the land will be managed as pasture, allowing for extensive animal grazing around the solar modules 
The impacts of each of these solarland management regimes on the local carbon cycle depend on the specific location, and the previous land use, and result from off-model calculations applied to the GCAM scenario outcomes which provide land cover changes per year, AEZ, and scenario. Section 2d of the SM gives full details on all applied assumptions and derived carbon cycle impacts.
Use of non-competing space on rooftops and in deserts and dry scrublands. Rooftop space is often used for smaller scale PV systems and has the advantage of not competing for space with other uses and avoiding some of the losses related to electricity transmission and distribution. On the other side, rooftop spaces are often not optimal, and only about 2 to 3% of urbanized surface area can be used for PV systems with reasonable efficiencies (taking into account specific factors such as roof slopes and shadows between buildings) 
Land that is not used and neither has potential for any other productive use from a human perspective, such as deserts and dry scrublands, can be suitable for solar energy. By default, deserts are exempted from land competition in GCAM, while only 10% of current scrublands are included in the land competition module in GCAM v4.3, taking into account both non-fertility of scrublands as well as the protected status of some of these land areas. The EU, Japan and South-Korea have limited amounts of deserts and scrublands (see Table 
Further background assumptions related to the modelling can be found in the SM.
