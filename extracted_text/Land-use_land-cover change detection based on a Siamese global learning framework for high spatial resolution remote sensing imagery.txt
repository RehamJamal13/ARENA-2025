Abstract: High spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images can reflect more subtle changes and more specific types of land use and land cover (LULC) due to the abundant spatial geometric information. In this article, a class-prior object-oriented conditional random field (COCRF) framework consisting of a binary change detection (CD) task and a multiclass CD task is proposed to fill the application gap. In the proposed framework, the class-prior knowledge is used to improve the construction of the unary potential in both the binary and multiclass CD tasks, to reduce the influence of spectral variability. The binary CD result provides a constraint to the multiclass CD result. As a result, both parts have effective interaction.
The class posterior probability images of two dates can be obtained automatically with the class-prior knowledge by sample migration. Furthermore, an object constraint described by the class dispersion within the objects is added to improve the smoothness in local objects, while the pairwise potential improves the smoothness of the whole area by using the eight-neighborhood spectral information of the center pixel. By integrating the above approaches, the problems of error accumulation and the manual intervention required in the traditional multiclass CD methods can be relieved. An adaptive parameter estimation strategy is also adopted in the proposed framework, to save the time required for manual parameter setting. The proposed COCRF framework was validated on two HSR remote sensing image data sets, where it achieved a better performance than the other state-of-the-art CD methods.
