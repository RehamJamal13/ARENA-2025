ABSTRACT:
Tropical ecosystems play an important role in the environment. They provide multiple ecosystem services, such as carbon capture and sequestration, food supply, and climate regulation. Studying land use and land cover change makes it possible to understand the land's alterations associated with deforestation, degradation, erosion, soil desertification, and biodiversity loss. The objective of this study is to evaluate the different approaches to land use and land cover research in tropical forests based on the evolutionary and qualitative analysis of the last 44 years of scientific production. The data were collected using the Scopus database and was based on the PRISMA methodology's four phases: (i) identification, (ii) screening, (iii) eligibility, and (iv) included. The results showed a significant increase in the study of land use and land cover consolidated in 4557 articles, with contributions from 74 countries, revealing 14 themes and seven lines of research. Core research areas such as biodiversity, land use, and conservation exist due to the ongoing interest in the value of tropical forests and their response to climate change. The present research allowed us to consider future study topics such as the relationship between sustainable development goals and land use and cover in tropical forests, as well as the evaluation of the environmental impact of economic activities in forests.

## Introduction ##
Tropical forests differentiate between neotropical (New World) and paleotropical (Old World) 
Tropical forests are classified according to their elevation, annual rainfall, and degree of seasonality. They fall into four main types: ever-humid, semi-green, dry, and montane deciduous forests 
The Amazon houses approximately 30% of the world's tropical forests 
Tropical forests play a vital role in the conservation of biodiversity, climate change, and the regulation of the water cycle in the region 
Land use and land cover (LULC) changes directly or indirectly transform the quality of the tropical forests and the resources they provide 
Land use and land cover is commonly used to describe the Earth's surface coverage 
LULC studies can help manage natural resources sustainably 
Forests 2022, 13, 1709 3 of 34 sustainable practices for the development of agriculture 
Tropical forests have been the subject of studies regarding LULC due to their ecological, economic, and social importance. In these studies, various areas are analyzed; some focus on the relationship between LULC and climate change and its effects on the environment 
The constant growth of published information in the form of academic texts requires knowledge of the tools to measure the performance of the literature 
Over time, various studies on land cover and land use change in tropical regions have taken place, but only a few show this area's growth through bibliometric analyses. Among those studies, there is the study of the causes and effects of fires in tropical forests 
This study has five sections: the first section, or introduction, discusses the importance of tropical forest land use change, as well as the objective of the study; the second section contains materials and methods that show the database used, as well as the data search and processing; the third section includes results, detailing the main findings and their analysis; the fourth section focuses on the discussion, where the implications of the results are analyzed; and the fifth section includes the conclusions and limitations of the study.

## Materials and Methods ##


## Study Area ##
The study area comprises tropical forests located between the Tropics of Cancer (23.44 • N) and Capricorn (23.44 • S) (https://pb463.users.earthengine.app/view/fipnee202 0, accessed on 5 August 2022) 

## Methods: Data Processing ##
Academic literature can be analyzed and explored through systematic and bibliometric analyses. The systematic approach includes rigorous techniques to make the data collection procedure transparent and easily replicated, thus reducing the bias in the information obtained 
Bibliometric analysis can effectively describe a discipline's state of knowledge, characteristics, and trends 
Based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology (Figure

## Stage I: Basis Query ##
This research aims to evaluate the land cover and land use changes in tropical forests worldwide through the bibliometric analysis of scientific publications. The search terms used are related to land use 
Based on the above, the defined criteria aim to answer the following research questions (RQ):

## • ##
RQ1: What are the scientific production trends regarding LULC in tropical forests? • RQ2: What are the most relevant publications and the countries that contributed to the growth of this field of study? 

## Stage I: Basis Query ##
This research aims to evaluate the land cover and land use changes in tropical forests worldwide through the bibliometric analysis of scientific publications. The search terms used are related to land use 
Based on the above, the defined criteria aim to answer the following research questions (RQ):  The data collection occurred exclusively using the Scopus database, with a defined period from 1978 to 2021. The year 1978 was selected because it was when the first articles appeared in the database and the year 2022 was excluded, given that it is in progress at the time of this research.

## Stage II: Data Search and Collection ##
Bibliometric studies generally need appropriate databases with complete and reliable information 
The article sample analyzed in this study was selected based on a search carried out in February 2022 in the Scopus database using the topic search: TS = ((TITLE-ABS-KEY ("land use") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ("land cover") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ("land use change"))) AND ((TITLE-ABS-KEY ("amazon*") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ("rain forest*") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ("tropical forest*"))) AND (EXCLUDE (PUBYEAR, 2022)). The search obtained a total of 5557 documents.
Documents that went through a general review process, such as editorials, books, and conference papers, were excluded 

## Stage III Software and Data Selection ##
Once collected, the data from the Scopus database were exported to both a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and a text document for its respective treatment 
The Microsoft Excel Office 365 MSO software (Version 2209) performed the descriptive statistical analyses of the studied variables 
The bibliometric maps were built with the VOSviewer tool to visually present the statistical results related to the distribution of authors, institutes, countries/territories, and keywords 

## Stage IV Data Interpretation ##
During the collected data analysis, two bibliometric approaches were used. The first bibliometric approach focuses on the performance of scientific production. The second bibliometric approach involves studying its intellectual structure through bibliometric mapping 
Performance analysis evaluates the impact of the scientific publications that make up this structure by contrasting information related to the number and year of publications, authors, affiliations, and journals

Period 
Period 
During this period, there was an advancement in environmental and climate debates, Period 
Historically, it is a consolidation period for environmental research, mainly due to online information, storage platforms, and their public availability for consultation. The "US Geological Survey" [166] site is highlighted during this time because it facilitated an expressive set of information involving the Earth's surface mapping. That data will become a part of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s EarthData 
Forests 2022, 
In this phase, the Google Earth system was widely used, popularizing the use of geographic information systems in people's daily lives, through the historical analysis of images, providing a quick view of the changes in vegetation cover and the effects of deforestation. Continuing with the Google platform, the Google Engine tool makes the processing of digital images and land cover change analysis independent from commercial programs. In addition, it marks the current advancement in geotechnologies, including drone imaging, which generates high spatial resolution imagery applicable to environmental surveillance and enforcement.

## Discussion ##
This paper investigates the scientific trends and evolution of LULC research in tropical forests. Regarding environmental sciences, this bibliometric research adds a new perspective to the current forest situation by identifying the countries that contribute the most to LULC studies. At the same time, the management, conservation, and implementation of public policies that help control environmental problems such as global warming, deforestation, and forest degradation are increasingly crucial for researchers, world leaders, and organizations. For this reason, a bibliometric analysis can serve as a starting point to determine the topics of most significant interest in this field of study.
Tropical forests play an important ecological, social, and economic role. In addition to having rich biodiversity, they are home to multiple human communities and providers of various ecosystem services 
On the other hand, Brazil has a considerable extension of tropical forests. Their participation is important due to their interest in Amazon conservation, which represents approximately 60% of the Brazilian territory 
The importance and conservation of tropical forests and their carbon reserves and emissions belong to topics analyzed through satellite images. These images also facilitate the exploration of different land uses, land cover, and the carbon balance 
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) established in 2015 would also benefit the development and conservation of tropical forests. Several researchers analyzed the relationship of LULC with the SDGs in these ecosystems. These studies include public policy proposals to allow the sustainable management of tropical forests, coverage mapping 
Remote sensing has been a tool used since the beginning of LULC research in tropical forests. Since 1972, Landsat satellite data has made it possible to analyze changes in global coverage, such as deforestation and the expansion of agricultural and urban areas. Starting in 2008, corrections were made regarding the errors presented in the datasets to improve their coverage 
Despite continuous advances in LULC research techniques in tropical forests, forest degradation retains various unknows in many human impact analyses 
The three bibliometric maps and intellectual structure analyses allowed us to analyze the relationships between the different topics and schools of thought:

## • ##
First, the keyword co-occurrence analysis made it possible to analyze the most prominent themes (Figure 

## • ##
The author co-citation analysis reveals the interconnections between different authors (Figure 
This research facilitates the analysis of the interrelationships between researchers, countries, and schools of thought where the different areas of LULC in tropical forests are studied. The development of this theme aims at the continuous understanding of the LULC impacts using newer mathematical, computer, and technological models, satellite missions 
An integrated analysis indicates that the scientific research on tropical forests has a greater focus on the Amazon region, which may be related to the fact that this area represents the largest tropical forest in the world, as well as to its fundamental role in conservation and in the fight against climate change. It also concerns land use and land cover alterations, which South American institutions and other countries are widely investigating, particularly in the United States and Europe. There is an inequality between Brazil and the other Amazonian countries regarding scientific production, since the Andean countries have a much lower percentage of research. This inequality creates a differentiated understanding of Amazonian problems and decreases the use of these studies in the development of public policies to control deforestation throughout the region.
Another important region for tropical forest assessment is Africa, where research production is reduced. The United States appears as a producer of knowledge about other areas of the planet, which reflects its dominance of information storage platforms, which have made satellite and radar images of the Earth accessible to the public, becoming a global generator of geospatial information. This situation implies that many countries with no surveillance systems use these external databases as the primary source of information, thus generating a direct intervention in their geopolitics.
Finally, although LULC research in tropical forests is not recent, and its growth in the last decade has been prominent, it is necessary to consider what other topics within the area could be analyzed. The following are some gaps in the research that future studies could address:
1.
Studies linking compliance with SDGs concerning LULC in tropical forests are required. Few studies address this issue, and the ones that do focus mainly on how deforestation and degradation monitoring can be used to manage these objectives.

## 2. ##
Studies of specific activities such as oil exploitation and mining focus solely on the effects on human health, and there are few publications on its impact on the environment.

## 3. ##
LULC studies in the Andean-Amazonian region should be expanded. A large part of the analyses use optical satellite images, where the presence of cloud cover is a problem that limits the generation of maps regarding land use and land coverage in these regions.
This study has some limitations, such as i) the exclusive consideration of scientific articles in English, and ii) the fact that the data analysis was limited to data from the Scopus database. As a result, the present study may have ignored some contributions in this field. Subsequent studies could consider these limitations to broaden the subject of study.

## Conclusions ##
This study demonstrates that in the last four decades, there has been an increase in the scientific production of tropical forests' LULC due to the collaboration of 74 countries. The intellectual structure in this field of study records collaborations of greater scientific production concerning (i) researchers: Shimabukuro Yosie and Barlow Jos; (ii) countries: the United States and Brazil; and (iii) journals: Forest Ecology and Management and PLOS One, as well as the collaborations with the highest number of citations: (i) author: Eric Davidson; (ii) country: the United States; and (iii) journal: Science.
The different approaches associated with LULC tend to focus on research topics related to the analysis of multiple anthropogenic activities that cause forest degradation and changes in their ecological dynamics. In addition, a growing interest in conserving these ecosystems due to their high biological, economic, and social value is revealed. The use and evolution of different technological tools that allow a multi-temporal analysis of the dynamics and structure of tropical forests were also evidenced.
This research serves as a contribution to future studies that explore the areas of knowledge focused on LULC in tropical forests because (i) it facilitates access to information on the most studied topics and the most representative authors, (ii) it guides researchers to form networks of collaboration when developing projects according to their area of study, (iii) it is a management tool for researchers to understand, in a general way, the intellectual structure of the area, and (iv) it is a complement for the identification of tendencies in the area that allow the generation of knowledge in favor of the sustainable management of forests.
