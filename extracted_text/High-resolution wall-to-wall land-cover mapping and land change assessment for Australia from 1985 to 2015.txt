## Introduction ##
Land cover has a significant influence on ecosystem function at all spatial scales, from global to local (e.g. 
Land change assessment relies mainly on the availability of classified spatial information, usually supported by ancillary variables 
Advances in land change monitoring are occurring rapidly in response to the increasing availability of high and medium-resolution satellite imagery 
The classification of raw spatial imagery is commonly performed by employing supervised classification methods 
Australia-the focus of our study-is a country with a heterogeneous landscape and complex land change processes. Major transformations in the Australian landscape began after European settlement, driven by "… [An] unrestricted access to land, technological change and growth in productivity and population" 
Here, we present the first consistent, high-resolution, long timeseries, wall-to-wall analysis of land-cover and land change for Australia. Using a combination of cloud-based (i.e., GEE) and local computational workflow, we mapped land-cover at 30-m resolution across the entire Australian continent at five-yearly time-steps from 1985 to 2015 by analyzing 281,962 Landsat scenes. The main objectives of this work were to: (i) develop a consistent set of historical land-cover and uncertainty maps at high-spatial resolution for an extended time period covering significant changes to the Australian landscape; (ii) identify land-cover change patterns at national and local scale; and, (iii) assess the accuracy of the land-cover and land change mapping over large areas. Because no historical ground-truth data are available for Australia, we used the Dynamic Land Cover Dataset v2.1 (DLCD) 

## Methods ##


## Study area ##
The focus of this study is continental Australia, with an area of 7,688,287 km 2 , comprising 89 bioregions and 419 subregions 

## Land-cover classification ##
Our wall-to-wall land-cover classification for Australia combined cloud-based and local computing approaches to pre-process, classify, validate, post-process, and analyze land-cover and land change (Fig. 

## Landsat data and other predictor variables ##
We used 281,962 atmospherically-corrected Landsat scenes to map land-cover including Landsat 5 (123,299 scenes), Landsat 7 (120,134 scenes), and Landsat 8 (38,529 scenes). At each 

## Pseudo ground-truth data ##
We used an interactive, semi-automated process for constructing a pseudo-ground truth training and validation dataset. First, we digitally sampled a total of 150,000 pixels via stratified (strata = DLCD landcover class) random sampling. Pixels were scattered across Australia

## Table 2 ##

Due to the spatial resolution of the DLCD, the reference year and its intrinsic uncertainties, overall accuracy = 82%, we employed an outlier detection method based on the spectral characteristics (at 30-m resolution) for eliminating potentially mislabelled pixels from the pseudoground truth dataset. We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 

## Supervised classification ##
We used a random forest (RF) classifier 
We tested, on a local computer, hundreds of different combinations of ancillary variables as predictors. After running a RF model for every subset of variables (size and bands were randomly selected) in the training dataset, we selected the most parsimonious model, i.e., the model with fewest variables (to avoid computational limits in GEE) and the highest observed accuracy as measured against the validation dataset. We used the caret 
To avoid overfitting and to increase the robustness of our classification we used the mode of ten different RF classifications as the mostlikely land-cover classification for every pixel and every time-step. Based on the k-fold cross-validation method used for assessing the uncertainty of a model estimation 

## Post-classification ##
Approximately 6 7 land-cover change combinations are possible in our study period, some less likely than others, which difficult the establishment of a robust set of transition rules for ensuring the temporal consistency of the classifications. Hence, we decided to take a transparent approach and minimise the amount of postprocessing, but also providing the user with the ability to implement their own postprocessing. Only one post-classification process was implemented where all pixels classified as Built-up areas outside of urban centres defined by the 'Urban Centre and Localities' (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2016) layer were reclassified as Other. These maps present a transparent landcover classification and, in combination with the two per-pixel confidence layers (see Section 2.3), can be further post-processed and refined according to user preferences. Land-cover transitions and land change was calculated after this post-classification correction (see Section 2.3).

## Accuracy assessment and land-cover change analysis ##
Using the validation dataset we calculated seven confusion matrices (one per epoch) for determining the overall, producer, and user accuracy (OA, PA, and UA, respectively) of land-cover classifications, after the Built-up area correction 
Where H represents the entropy, n the number of independent classifications and P i the probability of a given land-cover class. We established three levels of entropy: low, medium, and high when a pixel was mapped as the same land-cover in at least seven, five, and three cases, respectively. The second per-pixel confidence measure was the margin of victory, defined as the difference between the two most common landcover classes among the ten runs 
For assessing the accuracy of land-cover change represented by our maps, we conducted a random validation of 1800 pixels in six sites with diverse landscape mosaics, as suggested by 
In every site, we visually checked the land-cover classification of 300 pixels, sampled in a stratified random approach, and the land-cover transitions (if any) across the years. We used Google Earth Pro® for assessing the temporal dynamics of every pixel. We then built binary confusion matrices for assessing whether land change or the lack of it had been correctly identified. Following Foody (2010), we calculated the: 1) sensitivity (S 1 ), that is the proportion of pixels correctly classified as having changed (Eq. 15); 2) specificity (S 2 ), that is the proportion of pixels correctly classified as having not changed (Eq. 16); and, 3) prevalence (θ), that is the proportion of pixels that changed in the period of comparison (Eq. 17) (Table 
Post-classification land change assessment between two time-points can often lead to erroneous estimations of change 

## Results ##


## Land-cover classification ##
A consistent time-series of seven high spatial resolution land-cover maps was created for Australia for the period 1985-2015 at five year time steps (Fig. 
At a land-cover class level, accuracies were more variable. For instance, the producer accuracy for 2000 varied from 86.2% to 98.6% for Grasslands and Built-up, respectively, whereas the user accuracy varied from 82.1% to 99.4% for Grasslands and Water, respectively. The same pattern was found for other years, with Grasslands and Other areas having the lowest user and PA (>82%) (see supplementary materials, Table 
Fig. 

## Land-cover change ##
Land-cover transitions over the period of study showed that approximately 6.7% (±0.9%) of the total Australian territory experienced definitive land-cover change. Built-up areas experienced the highest relative increase of 19.2% (±3.1%) by 2015 compared to its extent in 1985, expanding mainly into former Grasslands (~ 2152 km 2 ) (Table

The sensitivity for capturing change in land-cover at the national level was 96.4%, whereas the specificity for representing no-change was 68.3% (Table 

## Discussion ##
We have developed a consistent time-series of seven high spatial resolution (30-m) land-cover and uncertainty maps for the period 1985-2015 for continental Australia. We show that an error-adjusted area of 510,975 km 2 (±69,877 km 2 ) of Australian land changed at a rate of 17,033 km 2 yr -1 (±2329 km 2 yr -1 ). 

## Interpretation of land change in Australia ##
Land change has occurred heterogeneously across Australia and between land-cover classes. For instance, Croplands continuously declined in area until 2005 when Grassland transitioned to Cropland and Forest, increasing Cropland extent mainly in Queensland and Victoria. Increases in population and population density, access to markets, and climate conditions are likely to have influenced these cropland dynamics 
Our definition of Grassland included pastures (managed and unmanaged), chenopods, tussock grasses, and hummock grasses covering around 66% of the Australian land mass and making this class the dominant land-cover class in the country. Changes in Grasslands appeared to be a response to changes in other land-cover classes. At the national level, Grassland increased in extent because of losses in Forest and Cropland (Table 
Built-up areas experienced the highest relative increases across the country at around 19% over the study period. Increases in population coupled with low population densities, growth in GDP and incentives for infrastructure construction have all influenced the magnitude and direction of urban growth 
Water presented 5.8% (± 1.4%) increase in area from 1985 to 2015. This apparent increase is most likely to result from temporal dynamics in lake area resulting for seasonal wetting and drying (e.g., salt lakes). Other areas also displayed increases, but it was not possible to discriminate between classification error and actual changes as these areas were commonly confused with other land-cover classes (Table 

## Land-cover classification a comparison ##
Our estimates of land-cover extent for every class differed with the extents reported by the DLCD v2.1 map (Table 
New studies at high-spatial resolution are offering new insights of land-cover extent. For example, recent figures produced by 

## Potential application of data and methods, and caveats ##
Our results provide a comprehensive set of historical wall-to-wall land-cover and uncertainty data layers and land change information for Australia. Until now, national land-cover information for Australia was available only at coarse-spatial resolution (e.g. 
The methodological framework employed, cloud-based and local, for our mapping provides a robust and efficient approach for producing land-cover information over large areas can be readily adapted, refined, and applied elsewhere as it. Until now, multiclass time-series information at this spatial extent and resolution has been limited to a few regions around the globe and lacked uncertainty information at a spatial level 
While we have made every effort to make the landcover mapping process transparent, reproducible, and the error and uncertainty explicit, significant limitations persist. First, although GEE offers a proprietary cloud-computing service, free for research purposes, with unparallel capabilities for handling and analyzing petabytes of geospatial information, as part of the terms of service, GEE may add, modify, or deprecate any of its analytical algorithms or functions which might alter the performance of the analysis (we recommend readers keep abreast of the latest updates in GEE by referring to the API changelog, https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/changelog) or even preclude future replication. Similarly, future reproducibility of the current research will also depend on the existence of remote GEE servers. Studies at smaller scales should consider the use of historical stable archives (e.g., USGS EROS) and reproducible workflows.

## Accuracy, uncertainty, and its sources ##
Besides substantially enhancing the spatial and temporal resolution of the available land-cover information for Australia, our mapping product offers per-pixel confidence information unavailable at national level until now. Our classification performed better for Built-up and Water classes (producer and user accuracy >95%) whereas Grassland and Other areas presented the lowest accuracies (producer and user accuracy >82%). Furthermore, the land-cover extent of every class was unbiased. The omission and commission errors presented similar magnitudes for every class, except for Water where omission errors were slightly higher (i.e., maps identified less area of water bodies than their actual extent), suggesting no systematic under or overestimation. Over time, land-cover maps presented higher omission and commission errors for Grasslands and Forests. Land-cover change accuracy expressed as sensitivity and specificity, differed between the six sites assessed (Table 
Sources of lower accuracies (in the case of Grasslands and Other areas), commission and omission errors, and land-cover change errors are related to the: 1) definition of land-cover classes; 2) reliability of the satellite imagery and sensor limitations; 3) ancillary variables for landcover classification; and, 4) mislabeled training and validation data. We defined our land-cover classes based on the purpose of our mapping, the land-cover classification used as a reference, accepted definitions, technical capabilities of Landsat sensors, and the available information for discriminating similar classes (e.g., Grassland and Cropland). In this context, there is a trade-off between the reliability of the classifier for capturing differentiable classes (e.g., Built-up areas) and those that present similar spectral characteristics (e.g., Grasslands and Croplands). Furthermore, Grasslands and Other areas contain a vast array of spectrally similar sub-classes. For instance, from visual assessment we found common confusion between areas with sparse vegetation and Grasslands (in some areas those are classified as Forest and in other as Grasslands).
Similarly, Other areas (that included salt lakes, bare lands, mines, sand dunes, and wetlands) were often classified as Water, Built-up, or Grassland. While the addition of bioclimatic information (e.g., precipitation and mean temperature) and spectral indices (e.g., EVI, NDWI) at a seasonal level helped to improve the consistency of the classifications, further post-processing is required. Despite the temporal and spectral resolution of Landsat sensors, we managed to have cloud-free and shadow-free composites for every time-step. Because of the size of our study area, computation time and memory limitations in GEE, we restricted the number of ancillary variables (n = 49), descriptive statistics (we used only the median), seasons (n = 7), training (n = 19,552) and validation points (n = 9178), and, the number of k-folds (k = 10) used in the classification process. Although we tested the performance of the classification with different sets of variables on a local computer, we may have omitted/included relevant/redundant variables that could have influenced the final classifications. While increasing the training sample size and the number of folds used in the classification may further increase the accuracy of our results, the effect is likely to be marginal.
Our interactive semi-automated method for constructing an historical set of invariant pseudo-ground truth data performed adequately as we clustered pixels with similar spectral characteristics and retained those that did not change during the period of study. The process had to be complemented with a visual validation for reducing the maximum number of mislabeled pixels, and for ensuring a homogeneous distribution across the country and a robust training and validation dataset. Subjectivity at the moment of deciding the reference class of a pixel could have introduced noise in the training and validation datasets, however, the impact of noise on the final classification should be low 
Each land-cover map has an associated entropy and margin of victory map (Fig. 

## Conclusion ##
We have presented a historical set of seven wall-to-wall land-cover maps for Australia at 30-m resolution at 5-year time steps from 1985 to 2015. The maps are the first-of-their-kind for Australia, and one of only a few available at continental scale. They were created by using more than 281,962 Landsat scenes and have an overall accuracy of ~93%. Per-class producer and user accuracies were above 90% for most land-cover classes illustrating the confidence of our estimates. The results show that ~6.7% (±0.9%) of the Australian land mass has experienced land change at a rate of ~17,033 km 2 yr -1 (±2329 km 2 yr -1 ). While the main losses occurred in Croplands and Forests, the highest relative increases were experienced by Built-up areas coming mainly at the expense of Grassland losses. Accuracy assessment suggested that the sensitivity for capturing change was 96.4%, whereas the specificity for representing stable areas was 68.3%, i.e., change was erroneously simulated in areas dominated by a mosaic of Forest (especially open forests and tall woodlands), Grassland (tall shrublands), and Cropland. These results can be combined with the uncertainty maps for the design and implementation of postprocessing rules depending on the final users' needs. Similarly, these outputs can be used for identifying areas that require more ground-truth data. By exploiting the capabilities of GEE for analyzing big geospatial data, we have demonstrated that time-series mapping of land-cover over large areas at high-spatial resolution is now possible. This land change assessment framework is suitable for understanding land dynamics at large extents. Our freely-available maps provide a consistent data product for the assessment of land change at local to national scales and as inputs for a plethora of other modelling exercises and assessments.
