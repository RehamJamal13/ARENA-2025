<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Change of land use land cover (LULC) has been known globally as an essential driver of environmental change. Assessment of LULC change is the most precise method to comprehend the past land use, types of changes to be estimated, the forces and developments behind the changes. The aim of the study was to assess the temporal and spatial LULC dynamics of the past and to predict the future using Landsat images and LCM (Land Change Modeler) by considering the drivers of LULC dynamics. The research was conducted in Nashe watershed (Ethiopia) which is the main tributary of the Upper Blue Nile basin. The total watershed area is 94,578 ha. The Landsat imagery from 2019, 2005, and 1990  was used for evaluating and predicting the spatiotemporal distributions of LULC changes. The future LULC image prediction has been generated depending on the historical trends of LULC changes for the years 2035 and 2050. LCM integrated in TerrSet Geospatial Monitoring and Modeling System assimilated with MLP and CA-Markov chain have been used for monitoring, assessment of change, and future projections. Markov chain was used to generate transition probability matrices between LULC classes and cellular automata were used to predict the LULC map. Validation of the predicted LULC map of 2019 was conducted successfully with the actual LULC map. The validation accuracy was determined using the Kappa statistics and agreement/disagreement marks. The results of the historical LULC depicted that forest land, grass land, and range land are the most affected types of land use. The agricultural land in 1990 was 41,587.21 ha which increased to 57,868.95 ha in 2019 with an average growth rate of 39.15%. The forest land, range land, and grass land declined annually with rates of 48.38%, 19.58%, and 26.23%, respectively. The predicted LULC map shows that the forest cover will further degrade from 16.94% in 2019 to 8.07% in 2050, while agricultural land would be expanded to 69,021.20 ha and 69,264.44 ha in 2035 and 2050 from 57,868.95 ha in 2019. The findings of this investigation indicate an expected rapid change in LULC for the coming years. Converting the forest area, range land, and grass land into other land uses, especially to agricultural land, is the main LULC change in the future. Measures should be implemented to achieve rational use of agricultural land and the forest conversion needs to be well managed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Land use land cover (LULC) change occurs under a variety of pressure and it is the result of changes or modifications in the intensity of an existing LULC type to determine the location and nature of the land use change. The changes of LULC have been perceived as worldwide environmental change drivers in the watershed that are very sensitive to LULC dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. A dynamic LULC offers an inclusive sympathetic of the interactions and relations that are crucial for sustainable land resource management <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. At global and local levels, the changes of LULC are driven by anthropogenic and natural processes at different spatiotemporal levels. The LULC changes are dynamic, non-linear human-nature interactions that are significant land surface conversions and involve complex processes. The LULC change trajectory worldwide for the past 300 years has been categorized by gains in agriculture and losses in forests <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. According to the authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, LULC changes are associated with the change of forest land to agricultural expansion, urbanization, and deforestation.</p><p>The LULC changes were broadly assessed in various areas of the world, for instance, Europe and USA <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, South America <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, Asia, and Africa <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, Ethiopia <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. In Africa, the expansion of agricultural land influenced by rapid population growth has been recognized as a primary driver of LUC. Many developed countries including Europe and the United states practiced massive deforestation because of agricultural expansion and industrialization until the early 19th century <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Urbanization dynamics and urban growth are usually linked to demographic factors mostly in developing countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In Africa, the expansion of agriculture influenced by population growth has been recognized as a primary driver of land use land cover change (LULCC). The landscape has been intensely changed due to socio-economic and political changes that occurred in the first half of the 19th century in Europe <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The decrease in agricultural land at the expenditure of increased urban areas and water bodies in Europe is another strong trend <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>.</p><p>The dynamics of LULC intensities and rates are changing because they are highly associated with the overexploitation of natural resources. The natural variability issues like climate change, soil conditions, and terrain characteristics have also accounted for land use changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Therefore, the integration of natural and human factors in LULC dynamics have become a significant issue throughout the world in efficient land use. The assessment of LULC change and the drivers that have direct consequences on the natural environment and human societies are the focus of the current scientific examination of scientists <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In order to develop sustainable strategies and to have informed planning decisions, understanding the drivers and dynamics of LULC change is crucial. The LULC change driving forces can be direct or indirect for change over time and space; this was incorporated to provide an estimate of future scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>The drivers' assessment and predicting their future LULC status in the watershed is expected to have an essential contribution for land use planning management and sustainable water resources. The use of historical satellite imageries are used to effectively monitor and analyze LULC change <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Future LULC change analysis and prediction are often complicated for the stochastic change of nature and the dynamic of natural and socioeconomic variables. The prediction of forthcoming LULC dynamics in areas where the economic condition depends upon agriculture has a profound impact. The LULC model developed in this study predicts a future LULC state based on a business-as-usual scenario. Therefore, understanding the earlier and current LULC changes and simulating for the future is vital for the management of land and water resources of the basin <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</p><p>Models of land change are useful tools for environmental and other types of research concerning LULC change <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The magnitude and location are the two important issues of LULC that have been considered in the modeling. LULC change assessment models are either dynamic or static, non-spatial or spatial, deductive or inductive, pattern-based or agent-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Modeling the LULC process is to properly calibrate and validate the model for predicting future changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. The LCM embedded in the TerrSet model has been utilized to inspect the historical and to predict the future changes of LULC of the watershed. LCM primarily uses the MLPNN-CA-MC approach. The model is strong due to its dynamic projection proficiency, suitable calibration, and capability to simulate several types of land cover <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. LCM evaluates changes of the land use of two different periods, determines the changes, visualizes changes, and presents the results with various maps and graphs.</p><p>The model predicts future LULC images based upon MLPNN (Multi-Layer Perceptron neural networks) and CA-Markov Chain (CA-MC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The "transition potential" of pixel to change into another class determination is through MLP drivers of change <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. The MC model is stochastic, which requires pairs of LULC images to derive the transition potential into the future predictions based on the amount of historical change <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. The blend of CA-MC can simulate the spatiotemporal dynamics of LULC change. The model predicts transitions of a cell from one LULC to another depending on "physical and socio-economic" data <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. The model validation process is the accuracy assessment of prediction and contrast made between the predicted and observed land cover maps. Therefore, to assess the change drivers of the past and to simulate for the future, the validated data have been used.</p><p>Remote sensing data particularly Landsat images provide suitable possibility for LULC change monitoring, particularly for developing countries where geospatial technologies are not well developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. In Africa, around 40% of the population were living in urban centers as of 2014. By 2050 the urban residents' percentage has been projected to reach 56% <ref type="bibr">[33]</ref>. In Europe, between 1990 and 2006 the population grew up by 146% <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref> as per the study was conducted in 24 European countries. Currently in Europe around 73% of the population lives in urban areas and it is estimated to be over 80% by <ref type="bibr">2050 [33]</ref>. The availability of resources as well as their dynamics and management varies considerably from area to area, especially in Ethiopia. Ethiopia is highly vulnerable to environmental changes induced by natural and anthropogenic activities. LULC change is a fundamental problem in the country <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref>.</p><p>Due to changes of LULC, Ethiopia experienced serious environmental problems including soil erosion, land degradation, loss of soil fertility, and deforestation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>. The "Upper Blue Nile Basin (UBNB)" is the most varied and a highly important river basin in Ethiopia <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">38]</ref>. Nashe watershed is the tributary of the Basin that faced LULC change driven by population growth, urbanization, agricultural land expansion, deforestation, overgrazing, expansion of industrial activities, and political dynamics. The analysis of LULC change in Nashe watershed, its drivers, and prediction of future land use change are vital for understanding the dynamics of human environment interactions and environmental management interventions. Therefore, it is very important to assess and predict the LULC changes based on the historical data using Landsat images and Land Change Modeler. The following research questions were addressed: (i) what was the trend of LULC change within the study area in the past (1990-2019) and which LULC classes were mostly affected? (ii) What growth and change patterns can be expected in the future? (iii) What are the major driving factors of LULC change in the watershed?</p><p>The above research questions are so significant and addressed in this study of watershed since a dramatic socio-economic change with expected enormous effect on the land use is undergoing and this will influence various hydrological processes. Thus, especially in the UBNB, those changes need to be predicted in time for environmental management in this area in an effective and sustainable manner. The study findings are utilized to provide empirical evidence on patterns and rates and identify major driving forces of LULC dynamics at watershed level, and improve policies in land use within the framework of sustainable land use planning in relation to future changes or development.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Land Use and Land Cover Change Assessment 2.3.1. Image Classification</head><p>The classification of images is to categorize automatically all pixels from the Landsat images into LULC classes to extract useful thematic information <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref>. For image classification, the data of ground truth were gathered on the field and satellite image verification. After pre-processing the satellite images, the supervised classification was implemented using "maximum likelihood classification (MLC)" technique to produce image classification. The MLC method is the widely used algorithm for supervised satellite image classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref>. The method has a strong theoretical foundation and the ability to accommodate varying data, LULC types, and satellite systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. The approach of supervised classification is adopted as it preserves the basic land cover characteristics through statistical classification techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref>. In classifying the 1990, 2005, and 2019 images, reference data were gathered from images of Google Earth and through interviews from concerning body of the corresponding time periods.

Since land use maps derived from image classification usually contain some errors, the accuracy of classification results obtained must be assessed. Assessing the classification accuracy provides the degree of confidence in the results and the subsequent change detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref>. For accuracy assessment, the classified map was compared with ground truth data. For 1990 and 2005, the reference points were collected from Google Earth, original Landsat images, interviews, group discussion, previous reports, and maps. For the 2019 image, Google Earth, field observation, original Landsat images, interviews, and group discussions of random reference points in different LULC types were recorded from the field survey conducted by using GPS.</p><p>The common and most effective method used to measure the accuracy of the classified image from remotely sensed imagery is an error/confusion matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref>. The confusion matrix provides overall accuracy, user accuracy, producer accuracy, and kappa statistics. Kappa coefficient was determined by using Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref>. According to the authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, a kappa coefficient value below 0.4 shows poor agreement, a value between 0.4 and 0.8 depicts a moderate agreement, and a value greater than 0.8 shows a strong agreement.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">K = N ∑ r i=1 Xii -∑ r i=1 (Xi+) * (X + i) N 2 -∑ r i=1 (Xi+) * (X + i)<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">K = (Total * sum o f correct) -sum o f all the (row total * column total) Total squared -sum o f all the (row total * column total)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where r-rows number in the matrix, Xii-number of observations in row i and column i (the diagonal elements), X + i and Xi+-the marginal totals of row i and column I, respectively, and N-observations number.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3.">Land Use Land Cover Change Drivers</head><p>Driving factors influence LULC changes. LULC changes are driven by natural and human activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The regionally differing main drivers have great impact on many environmental aspects <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref>. Provided that drivers of past changes are sustained, they can be expected to be influential forces in the future. LULC change simulation studies have used topographic and distance driver variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">46]</ref>. Elevation, slope, distance from roads, distance from streams, distance from urban area, and evidence likelihood rasters were considered as the potential driver variables. Distance from roads, distance from streams, and distance from urban area were set as dynamic variables to express the varying distance as they change over time.</p><p>The evidence likelihood is an empirical probability of change in the LULC categories between an earlier and a later map <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref>. It is used to transform categorical variables, such as change from one land cover class to another into numerical values. The significance of driver variables was tested using Cramer's V and P values which measure strength of the correlation between two variable classes. Cramer's V value is a coarse statistic measure of the association strength or dependency between variables, and it ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 in value.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.1.">LULC Prediction</head><p>The LCM (Land Change Modeler) embedded in the TerrSet Geospatial Monitoring and Modeling System (TGMMS) software was used for prediction of future LULC for a specified year based on the classified historical satellite images. The LCM determines how the factors influence future LULC change, how much land cover change took place between earlier and later LULC, and then calculates a relative amount of transitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[51]</ref>. It was widely tested and used to predict change for the analysis and modeling of impacts on biodiversity using multiple land cover categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref>. The module provides changes of the LULC assessment as losses and gains to each LULC category. LCM produces two simulated maps, i.e., soft projection and hard projection. In hard predictions, a simulated map is developed for the prediction year, in which each pixel is allocated to a specific land use category <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[52]</ref>. Whereas, the soft prediction is a projected map created to show the vulnerability in which each pixel is allocated a value from 0 to 1. The smaller value indicates less vulnerability to change and the high value shows high susceptibility to change <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[52]</ref>. Similarly, the model is used for analyzing, predicting, and validating the predicted LULC change <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[53]</ref>.</p><p>The trend variations of LULC changes for the years 1990, 2005, and 2019 were analyzed to predict future years of the watershed. The future land use scenarios were based on recent trends, historical land use information, and anticipated future changes. The LCM uses the "change analysis" tab, the "transition potentials" tab, and the "change prediction" tab. The change rates were determined through the "change analysis" tab, along with the "transition potential" maps to simulate the future scenario. The LCM module allows three different approaches to produce maps of transition potential based on the individual sub-models and associated explanatory variables: multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network, logistic regression, and a similarity-weighted instance-based machine learning tool (SimWeight) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref>. The MLP estimates accurately the land that would be estimated to change from the image of later date to the specified simulation date based on the projection. From the approaches, the performance of MLP is stronger when modeling the relationship between non-linear land change and the explanatory variables. It is more flexible and dynamic compared to the others when multiple transition types are modeled <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref>.</p><p>The TerrSet model uses CA-MC which is a stochastic modeling process to simulate the future changing over time from past changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[54]</ref>. It predicts the spatial structure of various LULC categories and scenarios based on the TPM <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">55]</ref>. To predict LULC change, the Markov matrix model depends on the Bayes equation (Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>)) that evaluates the change by comparing the initial (T1) and the second land cover (T2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">S (t+1) = P ij * S (t) (3) Pij =     P11 P12 . . .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.2.">Model Validation</head><p>Validation is simply a procedure to assess the quality of the predicted LULC map against a reference map <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[57]</ref>. The images of Landsat for 1990 and 2005 were utilized to simulate the 2019 LULC image. The comparison of simulated LULC image with the actual map was developed. The LULC of the 1990 and 2005 years were provided to calibrate LCM, and the model was validated by simulating the recent LULC map of 2019. The validation process in LCM involves a cross-tabulation in a three-way comparison between the later land cover map (2005), the predicted land cover map (2019), and the actual map (2019). The module validation in the LCM model was used to assess statistically the quality of the predicted 2019 LULC image against the 2019 reference image <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[57]</ref>.</p><p>The map shows areas where the model correctly predicted called "hits", areas where the model predicted change but it actually did not occur called "false alarms", and occasions where the model was unable to predict it, but areas are changed in reality, called "misses". After the model prediction capacity was verified between the 1990 and 2005 time periods for 2019, the simulation process was repeated to project the 2035 and 2050 map using 2005 and 2019 classified maps. The other method is the kappa coefficient calculation between the predicted map and actual land use map <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[58]</ref>. However, the original kappa coefficient does not distinguish between the quantification and location error, delimiting its expressiveness. This can be resolved by calculating cause dependent K-indices, Kno (kappa for no information), Klocation (kappa for location), Kstandard (kappa for standard), and KlocationStrata (kappa for stratum-level location) <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[58]</ref>.</p><p>The overall agreement of the projected and reference map indicates the Kappa for no information (Kno). The location kappa (Klocation) is used to compute the spatial accuracy in the overall landscape, because of the correct assignment values in each category between the simulated and reference map <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[59]</ref>. The ratio of inaccurately allocations by chance to the correct assignments is kappa for standard (Kstandard) <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[53]</ref>. The kappa for stratum level location (KlocationStrata) is a quantification of the spatial accuracy within pre-identified strata, and it indicates how well the grid cells are situated within the strata <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref>. The blend of Kstandard, Kno, Klocation, and Klocation strata scores is considered for a comprehensive evaluation of the overall accuracy both in terms of location and quantity. Additionally, the statistics considered are AgreementQuantity, AgreementChance, AgreementGridCell, Dis-agreementGridCell, and DisagreementQuantity to know exactly how strong the agreement is between the simulated map and the base map (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>). The DisagreementQuantity and DisagreementGridCell constituents are crucial to understand the simulated model <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[57]</ref>. This sort of validation method gives the idea about the level of agreement or disagreement between projected and actual LULC maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[49]</ref>. The two most important differences between the two categorical maps are in terms of quantity (changes or persistence) and allocation. Disagreement by quantity is the variation between two images because of an imperfect combination in the overall proportions of LULC categories. The allocation disagreement is the distinction between two images caused by an imperfect combination among the spatial allocations of all land cover map categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[53]</ref>.</p></div>

Different LULC categories of quantitative assessment, net change of LULC categories, and the contributors to the net change experienced by each LULC class are the three sections of results identified in the LCM. Change analysis was performed by using the classified maps <ref type="bibr">(1990, 2005, and 2019</ref>) and the predicted LULC (2035 and 2050) to demonstrate the pattern of changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[58]</ref>. The LULC dynamics in each study period were assessed using the numerical values extracted from the classified images. To acquire the change pattern, the images classified from consecutive periods were cross-tabulated and compared to each other. The probability matrix was done between 1990 and 2005, 2005 and 2019, 2019 and 2035, 2035, and 2050 using LCM. The change percentage <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref> and the rate of change were determined <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref> for LULC categories by using Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">6</ref>), respectively, to determine the amount of the changes experienced between the periods of the different LULC categories.</p></div>

The overall accuracy, kappa statistics, producer's and user's accuracy have been used for assessment. The kappa statistics and overall accuracy of classified images shows 91.43%, 87.59%, 85.71% and 0.93, 0.90, and 0.88 for the years 2019, 2005, and 1990, respectively (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>).

According to the authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[61]</ref>, LULC map accuracy is quantified by creating an error matrix or a confusion matrix, which compares the classified map with a reference classification map.

The LULC prediction in the watershed was based on change in a driver's impact. In this study, both topography and proximity factors were selected to analyze the LULC change. Before the drivers are added to the model, the selected driver variables were tested for their explanatory value using Cramer's V and P values (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">6</ref>). The Cramer's V value does not give decisive proof that a particular variable explains the change in land use. It is rather a more intuitive tool that can be utilized to understand the significance that a particular variable has in influencing change. Evidence likelihood is used for the determination of the relative frequency of pixels of different LULC types within the areas of change. It is recommended in cases where there are low Cramer's V values. The obtained result for evidence likelihood is considered as good. In this study, it is a quantitative measure of the frequency of change between agricultural land and all other land classes (also called disturbance).</p><p>From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">6</ref>, it was observed that the variable such as elevation, distance from urban areas, distance from stream, distance from road are considered as useful variables of transitions. Variables such as slope have low Cramer's V values, and it shows that the effect of slope on LULC change in the study area is not critical. The variables with good Cramer's V value show that they are the most explanatory variables for LULC change. All driver variables were used to model the transitions in this study. The elevation and slope are recognized as the imperative topographic factors affecting LULC change. Topography has effects on the spread and extent of urban distribution, forest and range land conversion to agricultural land. The authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[65]</ref> found that deforestation decreases with the increase of the slope gradient. The other driver variables such as distance from stream, distance from urban areas, and distance from roads also play an important role in land use change, as each provides convenience to residents to access resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Transition Probability Matrix (TPM)</head><p>Transition potential modeling is assessing the likelihood of LULC change from one class to another depending on the suitability transition of area and the presence of driving forces <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[66]</ref>. The TPM records the probability of each land use class to change into the other class. The LULC changes of the future predictions are utilized through the probability of the transition matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[67]</ref>. The transition probability matrices produced by the model between LULC types during the periods 1990-2005 and 2005-2019 were depicted in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">7</ref>. The spatiotemporal LULC change assessment between the earlier and later land cover maps were cross-tabulated. The cross-tabulation is used to determine the amounts of change and conversions between different land cover maps. In the table of cross-tabulation shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">7</ref>, the bolded frequencies along the transition probability matrix of the diagonal confirm the probability of LULC class remaining unchanged (persistence) from the earlier to the later land cover map. Whereas, the off-diagonal frequencies express the possibility of a given LULC experiences changes from one to another. The change analysis is depends on the changes in LULC between time 1 and time 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. The agricultural land which is the highest class has 39,662.13 ha with the probability of remaining as agricultural land in 1990-2005. The conversion of forest land, range land, and grass land was the major contributing land use for the agricultural land. The minimum loss of LULC category was observed from water body to grass land and urban land. Although in urban land there was minimum or no conversion to range land and water body. In 2005-2019 the highest class loss was the change of forest land to agricultural land by 12,051.96 ha.</p><p>In 2005-2019, especially since 2012, a dam on Nashe River was built for irrigation and hydropower purposes. The water body has increased. The displacement of communities occurred from their land during the expansion of hydropower projects and the displacement caused land scarcity. The lowland areas of the watershed was covered with forests, range lands, and grass lands before 1990 even before 2005. Currently, however, a great decline of forest cover is occurring because of urbanization and agricultural land expansion. In recent times, the expansion of urban areas has been continuously increasing at the highest rate.</p><p>The findings of the study show that urban area increase was consistent with other research findings in Africa <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and Ethiopia <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.

Similarly, a study in China reported that the urban built-up land expansion from conversion of cultivated land <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[68]</ref>. The authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> revealed that effective urban planning is needed to address the multiple challenges and competing interests of urban environments for the rapid increase in urban built-up area with scarce land and water resources on the urban edge.</p></div>

In order to assess the accuracy, validation of the model is necessary. Validation is significant as it allows to determine the quality of the predicted land cover map with actual map. A comparison was made between the actual and simulated LULC map of 2019 so as to validate the predicted map. The less effective simulated LULC class is water body as the projected map was from the maps before construction of the dam and the actual LULC map is from after the construction.

The simulated future LULC images of the watershed obtained from the LCM are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5</ref>. Similarly, the area coverage, percentage, and rate of change are provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">11</ref>. Generally, the LULC change increase or decrease was provided in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>.</p><p>Significant change was observed from the change analysis result in LULC change between 1990 and 2050. Agricultural land will be the predominant LULC type. It was seen from the result as the area of agricultural land increment from 61.19% in 2019 to 72.98% in 2035 and 73.24% in 2050. This was mainly caused by converting forest, range, and some parts of grass land. Agricultural land increased significantly from 1990 to 2035 and then slowly from 2035 to 2050 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">7</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">11</ref>). Similarly, a continuous increment was also observed in urban areas and water bodies from the 2019 to 2050 periods. The development of infrastructure, industry, and housing have taken place and are expected to take place around the watershed, therefore, the urban land will increase. The urban coverage around watershed totaled 1.15% in 2019, which is predicted to reach 2.00% and 3.82% by 2035 and 2050, respectively. The graphical demonstration of the area covered by six LULC classes for past years <ref type="bibr">(1990, 2005, and 2019</ref>) and for the prediction years (2035 and 2050) are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">8</ref>.   grass, and range land classes were registered net loss in the area from 1990 to 2035. Whereas, the range land and grass land smoothly gained from 2035-2050. The predicted results of the year 2035 and 2050 show an increase in agriculture, water body and urban land. Therefore, future land use activities ought to be based on proper land use development and land regulation to reduce the enduring adverse impact of LULC changes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>The present study was carried out to understand the changes in the historical and predicted land use land cover patterns from the year 1990 to 2050. The integrated approach including remote sensing, GIS, and a MLPNN-based CA-MC model was used to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of LULC and prediction of future LULC change in Nashe watershed, Ethiopia. The conclusions drawn from the research findings were the following.</p><p>The multitemporal satellite imagery data are used for informed decision-making in LULC change, providing the potential information required for monitoring and evaluating of LULC changes. The precision of the data from the remotely sensed imagery classified based on the maximum likelihood classification method with high resolution image of Landsat was checked through an error matrix and it yielded an acceptable result that was further processed for analysis.</p><p>To validate the model, the projected 2019 LULC map was compared with 2019 actual LULC map. After successful model validation, the LULC map for the years 2035 and 2050 were simulated by considering the business-as-usual scenario. In this procedure, we used 1990-2005 and 2005-2019 LULC data as a baseline and current scenario for comparison. Its validation showed a strong correlation between the simulated LULC map and satellitederived map, which proved the simulation model's reliability.</p><p>The rapid and massive changes of LULC in the watershed may have serious environmental impacts. The analysis of LULC change shows that forest cover has been decreasing, as well as the high increasing rate of urban area and agricultural land. The predicted LULC situation show that this cover would continue in the future. This will increase vulnerability of the watershed to landslides, soil loss, gully erosion, worsened air pollution, and impact the hydrology of the studied watershed in particular and the Blue Nile Basin The forest land and range land show a decreasing trend from 2019 to 2035. Unfortunately, the grass land, range land, and agricultural land will slightly increase from 2035 to 2050. This might be due to the limited area of land for different purposes. The major contributing factors to LULC change were the expansion of hydropower and irrigation projects, mostly at the downstream, for expansion of a sugar factory. The scarcity of jobs and urban expansions in the catchment amplified the socio-economic activities for LULC changes. In the watershed, the downstream and partly at the upstream areas, which were previously covered by forests and range lands, have been converted to agricultural land and commercial crop farms.</p><p>Forest reduction also occurred as a result of using charcoal and firewood as the energy source for most of the people living around the watershed, who depend on fuel wood. Additionally, most of the evacuated population during the construction of Nashe and Amerti projects were involved in converting the forest land to agriculture and settlement. Illegal and unplanned settlements by the local people to expand agriculture and settlement also contributed to destruction of forest land, range land, and grass land. Thus, the forest conversion needs to be controlled and well-managed, and a reasonable land use plan should be developed in an organized way. The expansion of one LULC type occurs at the detriment of other LULC classes <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[70]</ref>. Currently, the government has given more emphasis to the plantation trees program. Hence, in the country, many of the areas that were deforested might become covered by plants again. In the future prediction of LULC scenarios, the change of the area in the transition matrix was determined (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">12</ref>). LULC categories, agricultural land is expanding at an average rate of <ref type="bibr">39.15% (1990-2019)</ref>.</p><p>From the temporal patterns of the changes between 1990 and 2019, forest land decreased at a higher rate. The other affected LULC types were range land and grass land. The urban land and water body LULC classes gained trends in the study. Simulation analysis was conducted for the years of 2035 and 2050 based on historical LULC change data from 1990-2005, 2005-2019, and 1990-2019, which were used as a baseline. Similar to the historical analysis of LULC change, the predicted results of forest, grass, and range land classes were registered net loss in the area from 1990 to 2035. Whereas, the range land and grass land smoothly gained from 2035-2050. The predicted results of the year 2035 and 2050 show an increase in agriculture, water body and urban land. Therefore, future land use activities ought to be based on proper land use development and land regulation to reduce the enduring adverse impact of LULC changes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The study shows that agricultural land experienced the largest increase from the historical analysis to the projections. The conversion of other land uses to agricultural land might be mainly associated with the land demand for crop production to satisfy the food demand of the increasing human population, deforestation for household energy consumption, construction of materials, and loss of land productivity. This may cause serious environmental impacts unless proper environmental management strategies are planned and implemented. As per the analysis in the entire watershed, the urban area was increased. This increase was assumed to be closely associated with the rise of infrastructure to accommodate the increasing population. To minimize land degradation, it is necessary to apply management measures such as soil and water conservation technologies, family planning, and promotion of agricultural land use intensification in the study watershed. The future land use and land cover change plan for the study area should be made in advance and needs to be incorporated at policy level.</p><p>A Multilayer Perceptron neural network and CA-Markov modeling in LCM-based analysis was combined with GIS, and remote sensing technologies was used to perform the analysis of the LULC change. The performance of the MLPNN-CA-MC in LCM for the LULC pattern was not assessed previously over this study watershed as far as the authors are aware. Additionally, analyses regarding the dynamics of LULC changes and their drivers are not conducted in the study area. Therefore, in this study, the LULC dynamics of the historical and future LULC were assessed using Landsat images and LCM by using the drivers of LULC dynamics. Consequently, this study will also help to assess the performance of the MLPNN-CA MC approach over the watershed area. The future LULC is somewhat known in some parts of Ethiopia but not in the study area. The LCM embedded in the TGMMS model was successfully used by different researchers in other areas and it confirmed that LCM, based on MLPNN-CA-MC, is a capable model for the assessment and prediction of LULC change, urban growth, and the validation of results <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">72]</ref>.</p><p>Generally, the patterns of LULC change in the past almost three decades shows forest land decreased at an average rate of 48.38%. The results showed that the agricultural land gained the most area compared to the other LULC types. However, at the expense of forest </p></div>
